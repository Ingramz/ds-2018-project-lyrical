Eric Alexander,"I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love  you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't' want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you",Knocks Me off My Feet,2002
Eric Alexander,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love. 
Love.",Prisoner of Love,2004
Eric Alexander,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,2004
Eric Alexander,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2006
Eric Alexander,"There are some folks I used to know
Who used to smile and say hello
And spin the world and turn the page

Entertaining from the stage
But father time forever true
Loves its own and me and you
And disappear just like the sun
When the day is done

The world is falling down, hold my hand
It's a lonely sound, hold my hand
We'll follow the breeze and go like the wind
And look for a place where the willows bend
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Summer's gone and winter's here
We had a lot of rain this year
The news is really very sad
The time is late, the fruit is bad
The morning's come and roosters crow
But people have nowhere to go
And disappear just like the sun
When the day is done

The world is falling down, hold my hand
It's a lonely sound, hold my hand
We'll follow the sun and live for the day
And look for a place where the children play
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand",Aniuta,2007
Eric Alexander,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Mona Lisa,2012
Eric Alexander Quartet,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down",Good Morning Heartache,1995
Eric Alexander Quartet,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2007
Eric Ambel,"If I could make a wish I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you 
Has left me peaceful warm and tired
What more could I ask 
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
Sleep, silent angel go to sleep

Sometimes all I need 
Is the air that I breathe 
And to love you

Sometimes all I need 
Is the air that I breathe 
And to love you

Sometimes all I need 
Is the air that I breathe 
And to love you",The Air That I Breathe,1995
Eric Ambel,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind,2004
Eric and the Wreckage,"I hate everyone
And I don't like it son
And I do weigh a ton
And it's true, and it's true
And it's true, yeah, I'm confused
Yeah, I'm confused
Yeah, I'm confused
Yeah, I'm confused

I won't hesitate
And I will tempt fate
Now congratulate me, it's true
And it's true,
And it's true, yeah, I'm confused

Yeah, I'm confused, yeah, I'm confused",I'm Confused,2007
Eric Andersen,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots,1967
Eric Andersen,"Take me to the night I'm tippin topsy turvy turning upside down
                 
Hold me tight and whisper what you wish 

For there is no one here around

Oh you may sing song me sweet smiles

Regardless of the city's careless frown 
           
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
 
Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
                                    
In blindful  wonderments enchantments

You can lift my wings  softly to fly

Your eyes are like swift fingers reaching out
     
Into the pockets of my night


Whirling twirling puppy warm before the flashing cloaks of darkness 

gone          
Come see the no colors fade blazing

Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
                 
Some prince charming I'll be 
          
On Two white steeds to bring you diamond crowns
       
And climb your tower sleeping beauty 

Before you ever know I've left the ground

You can wear a Cinderella Snowhite Alice  Wonderland gown

Come watch the no colors fade blazing
      
Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
           
But if I seem to wander off in dream like looks 
     
Please let me settle slowly  

It's only me just staring out at you
          
A seeming stranger speaking holy 

I don't mean to wake you up it's only lonliness just coming on  
         
So let the no colors fade blazing into petal sprays
  
Of Violets Of Dawn
  
Like shadows bursting into mist 

Behind the echoes of this nonsense song

It's just chacing whispering trail

Of secret steps see them  laughing on 
     
There's magic in the sleepiness of waking to a childish sounding yawn 
          
Come watch the no colors fade blazing

Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn

Eric Andersen,"
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's 
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""

She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream

",Lovesick Blues,1969
Eric Andersen,"Florentine she's been 
around the world and back again 
A heart as light as wings 
made of sky, made of wind and things 
She keeps things you don't know 
She shows things you don't show 
She never wants to see you alone 

Something in her smile 
tells you she will stay awhile 
Something in her style 
shines and sets the sun on fire 
Every time she's near 
is like music to your ears 
before you rise she waits 
   inside your eyes 

Chorus: 
   If she were to say those words 
   would you understand 
   Wouldn't it be easier 
   to let her take your hand 
   Love's the song I sing 
   Song to Florentine 

Florentine she leaves 
a trail of misty make-believe 
You know she holds the key 
and you follow her to mysteries 
There's hidden things inside 
she leaves for you to find 
To unlock the road you must 
   say please 

Love's the song I sing 
Song to Florentine 
Love, love must be the song 
Song to Florentine 

",Florentine,1972
Eric Andersen,"Just a smile sit down awhile 
with her feathers and her brandy 
we're just movin' how ya' doin' 
how ya' doin' daddy

Pearl you know she could steal the show 
get ya' feelin' crazy 
get it on with you all night long 
and make you feel amazing 

Rag Mamma rag 
ya' got me off my feet

won't you rag Mamma rag ... Mamma 

Feathers flyin', she lookin' fine 
she just feelin' dandy 
she got her man and she holdin' hands 
and she just called him “Pappy” 
and she can sing the blues 
   right off your mind 

Pearl you know she could steal the show 
if she gets the notion 
rockin' on with ya' all night long

I just kicked off my shoes 
won't you rag Mamma rag 

Her eyes are wide 
she's runnin' scared 
was it something she was seeing

then it passed 
to somethin' she was needin'

   feeling at the time 
something she was 
   feeling at the time 

",Pearl's Goodtime Blues,1972
Eric Andersen,"All alone a father sits 
thinking of his son 
Far away a mother sleeps 
her baby yet unborn 

Chorus: 
   Rain and wood and fire and stone 
   magic all across the land 
   Seasons come and times will go 
   right through your hand, 
   like wind and sand 

In awhile a child will grow 
a bird will learn to fly 
Pretty soon a child will know 
what it is to make a life 

Chorus: 
   Long before the river goes 
   far from where it was 
   Long before it meets the sea 
   a child will know of love

",Blue River,1977
Eric Andersen,"Sitting here forgotten like 
A book upon a shelf 
No one there to turn the page 
You're left to read yourself 
Alone to sit and wonder just how the story ends 
Cause no-one ever told you child 
You gotta be your own best friend 

Sunny days  cloudy days 
Always seem the same 
If love were made of clouds I 
Almost wish that it would rain 
Even when the skies are clear 
The weather's always blue 
Every day would be nice If I had 
Someone I could come home to 

Love  is it really love at all 
Or something that I heard love called 
Something that I heard love called 

Now life can sometimes slip away 
And love can pass you by 
If only it had been another place another time 
Maybe there'll be someone who likes to see you smile 
Who will want to stay with you 
And be your friend for a little while 
Then wake up in the morning 
Feeling so alive 
Something you can hold on to 
Not a shadow by your side 
I guess that there'll be time to talk 
Of things that we've been through 
That special time when all is real 
To feel reborn  when love is new 

Love  is it really love at all 
Or something that I heard love called 
Something that I heard love called 

Then sundown comes around again 
You find yourself alone 
Wander through a sea of eyes but always on your own 
Was it really all you thought that it was suppose to  be 
Or are you just another face 
In someone's fading memory 

Love  is it really love at all 
Or something that I heard love called 
Something that I heard love called

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat,
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head.

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

I'm tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
I'm tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Eric Andersen,"So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

When you saw me I was broken
I was scattered in the dust
Like the way you feel sometimes
when you feel too much
You put your hands around my face
like a circle 'round the sun
When I thought that it was finished
it had only just begun

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, again

You shine across the morning
as I turn to face the east
You told me how to give away
things never meant to keep
Your love is rolling like a wave
that breaks right over me
One hand can hold the ocean
but will never stop the sea

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

Your skin it looks so golden
standing naked in the sun
Your soul it feels so holy
as close as the earth can come
A wave can cut a stone to sand
and the wind can break your bones
I'm wondering how you're doing now
when you are alone

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, once again, once again

He was just a prisoner
Prisoner of your pain
Whose sentence was to serve you
Let you love again
If you go away
He'll still be singing in his chains
Behind the walls of knowing
There was no such thing as blame

Deeper than the ocean
Wider than the sea
The loneliness you harbored from
A love that was deceived
How did you ever know
What the answer couldn't be
The dying's almost easier
Than trying to believe again

Your eyes they are so empty now
So pale in the sun
Your heart it is so weary
From not wanting anyone
With every breath you take
It's for the love that didn't come
Still longing for the day
You thought your life had just begun",Lie with Me,1991
Eric Andersen,"Ramblin' around this dirty old town
Singin' for nickels and dimes
Times getting rough I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Little hotel, older than Hell
Cold and as dark as a mine
Blanket so thin, I lie there and grin
Buy me little bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Aches in my head, bugs in my bed
Pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Won'ch buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Teacher must teach, and the preacher must preach
Miner must dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God
And hugging my bottle of wine

When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Eric Andersen,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans,2003
Eric Andersen,"I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky",Will the Circle Be Unbroken,2003
Eric Andersen,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn that he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be
One more person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only","It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)",2003
Eric Andersen,"I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
Your ways keep changing like the shifting desert sand

While I was playing fair baby you played a cheating game
While I was playing fair baby you played a cheating game

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
We have already come

Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain
All these places have their meanings
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love of something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Hold me tight and whisper what you wish 

For there is no one here around

Oh you may sing song me sweet smiles

Regardless of the city's careless frown

Whirling twirling puppy warm before the flashing cloaks of darkness

On Two white steeds to bring you diamond crowns
       
And climb your tower sleeping beauty

You can wear a Cinderella Snowhite Alice  Wonderland gown

Come watch the no colors fade blazing
      
Into pedal sprays of  Violets of Dawn 
           
But if I seem to wander off in dream like looks 
     
Please let me settle slowly  

It's only me just staring out at you
          
A seeming stranger speaking holy 

I don't mean to wake you up it's only lonliness just coming on  
         
So let the no colors fade blazing into petal sprays
  
Of Violets Of Dawn
  
Like shadows bursting into mist 

Behind the echoes of this nonsense song

It's just chacing whispering trail

Of secret steps see them  laughing on 
     
There's magic in the sleepiness of waking to a childish sounding yawn 
          
Come watch the no colors fade blazing

There's a time for love and a time for healing 
Can't go back and undo what's been done 
The word of mouth, time is revealing 
Just how far we've left this kingdom come 
Hand in hand we're finding our way 
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Kiss of life and the hand of fate 
Boy grows up into his father's son 
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate 
To carry on the way it had been done 
All our lives, it's debts to repay 
Maybe someday we can put the past away 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Put your fear away, find a better way

Eric B.,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Funky...
",Eric B. Is President,1987
Eric B.,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on 
You sweat as you step about to get hype 
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic 

You're physically in this with me but how could you tell 
If it's meant to be hip hop if you're not mentally as well 
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured 
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored 

If you just keep kickin' listen, to the mix 
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand 
Holds and controls you 'til I leave 
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe 

The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then 
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhymes' the oxygen 
Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you 
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue 

And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously 
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be 
Rising to the top, and I came to drop it 
Catch it and quiz it, is my topic 

Universual 'cause I move everybody to come 
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one 
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get 
I draw a crowd, like an architect 

The five borroughs react and all the islands attract 
And every state can't wait, so they attack 
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed 
It'll be more room if MC's play the back 

I'm the are the A to the K-I-M 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am 
The microphone fiend if I was a fake 
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make 

I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite 
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like 
The voice on the record, I see what you mean 
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream 

So just, give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it 
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well 
Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells 

I took time to write, tonight I will recite 
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight 
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin 
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin 

Home to tell a friend when the party ends 
""Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"" 
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage, 
Tape by tape and page by page, 

When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix 
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets 
Deeper and Deeper, I hope you understand it 
I made it up myself and I planned it 

For other MC's who waste time 
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme 
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating 
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking 

They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' 
To get up on the microphone and then start takin' 
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it 
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet 

Attracted to a freestyle put in effect 
You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet 
So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) 
Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, 

I want you to hear this perfectly clear 
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea? 
I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song

The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you want to get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it",I Know You Got Soul,1987
Eric B.,"Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
Cause when I heard the beat I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It's simple ain't it, but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make
Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long cause I'm a move on
The dance floor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
Cause I like to move the crowd

Imagine me with the heat that's made by solar
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth is shut
Cause I'm on the mic and Eric b is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praises due to Allah and that's a blessing
With knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving",Move the Crowd,1987

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
So I start my mission- leave my residence

Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money

But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great! so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive

Feelin' out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric be	, and a nice big plate of

Eric B.,"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up convert it in a hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
Cause you'll get fried in the end if you pretend to be
Competing cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme wit yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stun
Remember me, the one you got your idea from
But soon you start to suffer but you only get rougher
When you start to stutter that's when you had enough of
Biting it, I make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should of broke cause I ain't no joke

I got a question, it's serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pack then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood chores
The e-m-c-e-e don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those 7 mc's
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat dj, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait til e say
Play 'em, so I'mma have to dis and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke

I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation cause when I invent
I nominated my dj the president
When I'm senile, people freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
They'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiendin'
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the r so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
Cause I'm moving the crowd and b a record fader
No interruptions and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And take you for a walk through hell
Feed your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple state darkness
When it get dark again then I'mma spark this
Microphone cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finish when the beat is gone, I'm no joke",I Ain't No Joke,1998
Eric B.,"Have you ever been stabbed in the back
By someone you thought was really cool
Did they steal your heart or was it money
Or was it lies they told
Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again ?cause now you know

That friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind
Never know what's on their mind
Could be true deception
Jealousy and envy reign
They never want to see you get ahead
They just hold you back

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend, oh, oh

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Friends are hard to find, so be careful
You could find an inch or mile if I pay you
But some ain't that bad, but one might back stab
To get the fake tips of what one might have
Bite the hand that feeds you, leave the people who need you
For those who hold you back and mislead you
To be a needle, don't get lead on unleaded
The wrong direction, a dead end's next then
Heed the detour, life's like a seesaw
The ups and downs, and I'll bet there'll be more
Potholes and obstacles in our path, that's righteous
At times you need a hand to fight this
Way of life, straighten up, take the door to the placid
And don't you act two-faced
?Cause jealousy and envy, and you still act friendly
You could find the end and pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, yeah

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Used to me kiss me, tell me you missed me
But now you try to glaze me, play me and diss me
Uh, wide awake, ready to break, so we argue
What happened to the kisses, and, ""Why, how are you?""
Forgot about the times when I rhymed when I bathed you
Dreams was the only little things that I gave you
You still ain't thankful, you're still complainin'
Used to be a quiet storm, but now it's rainin'
Farther than ever, I'm thinkin' whether
If we should be friends, let it end, is it better
To forget or remember, your body's tender
The rhymes that I send her, makes her surrender
The feeling of capture, caught in a rapture
No woman can match ya, so when I'm lookin' at ya
Paint a perfect picture so you can remember me
But you can find the end if you pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, oh, oh

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, yeah

Eric B.,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Eric B.,"Follow me into a solo,  get in the flow
And you could picture, like a photo
Music makes mellow, maintains to make
Melodies for MCs, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting; I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it now it's a daily word
I can get illin' at normal killin'
Bambino along, Rakim'll remain calm
Self esteem make me super superb and supreme
Before a microphone, still, I fiend
This was a take, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see 'em keep followin' and swallowin'
Takin' the makin', bitin' and borrowin'
Brothers try and others die to get the formula
But I'm a let 'cha sweat.  You still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posin'
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me, and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel adventitious at speeds around the universe
What could you say as the earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay?
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
As far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare into the darkness, your knowledge: took!
So keep starin', soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the ""R""
This is a lesson.  If you're guessin' and if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'

This is a lifetime mission
Vision a prison.  All right, listen
In this journey, you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you movin' 'cause the crowd said so
Dance!  Cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades, bleedin' death.  Call an ambulance!
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murderin' MCs
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
""Follow the Leader!""  ...Yeah, dope!
'Cause every time I stop, you see, just duck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin' and provin' and lettin' knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever.  You disagree?
You say, ""Never?""  Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
Called by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I had to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we were put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
Again, somebody told you, a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed with a
Switch.  Here's a lesson if you're guessin', if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'

My third eye make me shine like jury
You're just a rented rapper, you're rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when they fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every trade of my snake so stay awake
And follow and follow 'cause the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to Daddy...  Indeed!
The ""R's"" a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directs the tone then rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin'!  A brother said, ""Dig him?""  I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
It's a danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, to space it, grace it, change the tone
There's one ""R"" in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B., be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state.  Follow us.  Tailgate
Keep comin', but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up your group, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant.  Clap your hands.  You won a trip
The price is right.  Don't make a deal too soon
How many notes?  Could you name this tune?
""Follow the Leader"" is a title they task
Now you know; you don't have to ask
Rappers' rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might get junked if you follow the records he wrecks
Until then, keep eatin' and swallowin'
You better take a deep breath and keep followin'

Eric B.,"I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good looking, is this seat tooken
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your hostile, 'itty attitude wit a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot
Is it because your sign don't talk a lot
She turned away, no play, I said ok
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familar scene
I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See i don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hm, I didn't want to play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said hi
Curiosity- at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
i said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find,
I want to know what's on your mind

CHORUS
About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello""
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't want to stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I want to get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ectacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find...

I want to know what's on your mind
I want to know what's on your mind

Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound

Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to the her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing ; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me,
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...",What's on Your Mind,2005

Don't sweat the technique
Let's trace the hints and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul.
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass, 'till MC's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
With beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's want to beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
They want to know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but
Researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to last who observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique
But don't sweat the technique
I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

'Cause if twitter had a twitter I bet it would follow me 
Chyeah, feel the presence when I come through 
New or old, I run school 

And I was never blinded by the lights 
But I've always had stars in my eyes 
So whether open or closed my vision's in line 
And maybe that's the reason why 
 
I'm one step ahead of you, you never catch up to me

Chyeah, try test me on stage, you'll be left burning 
I kill bills, Uma Thurman 
You get tired diorrns, I get lie-in morns 
You don't think you're the best, why you lying for?

Eric B.,"Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano

Bring a bullet proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
Now what the trigger say

Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through

Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady
Say don't lose me

So reload quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin'
This fifi get wit' me

You steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me

Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But watch the God get

Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast

Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't thirty-eight
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate

Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' 'em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma

Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I

Reduced the friction
With crucifixion
Let loose the mix
Then boost the piston

Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that

I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm
Hit another M.C.

Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when

Music is louder
Full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of

Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss

But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines
That I have to hit

Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up

You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate
And nothing's equivalent

Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around
To rob with a army

You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em,
Soon as I inject 'em

With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in

Let it split 'em
Since he brought his main man wit' 'em
He ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass

Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance

The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here
Let me introduce you

Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy

Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a havoc

If ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention, follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose

Too many milligram
But what made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man

Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'em, he'll never forget 'em
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em

At least when he left he'll know what hit 'em
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, catch up, hell no

Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it

Perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'

Blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein, then remain, let it radiate

Vibes will vibrate, why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style break
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone

Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach your intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my write reflect

Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er

Eric B.,"Me and Eric be	 was coolin' at the Paladium 
Seen a all world covered girl  I said ""Hey lady I'm 
Sorry if You're in a rush   Don't let me hold ya up 
Or interveen or interrupt  but

You got the look   I want to get to know ya better 
I had to let her know   but yo  I didn't sweat her 
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein' 
Almost looked Korean  but European. 

When she spoke  her accent was self-explanatory - 
Even her body language told the story 
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony 
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric be"" 

Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk, 
So we could talk and see New York. 
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock 
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't want to stop 

Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same 
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain 
Each mic is a mineral, poetry's protein 
Verse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine 

So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal 
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real 
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist 
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said 

[Chorus] 
Over Me, She's goin' crazy 
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy 
She said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G 
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony 

So I prescribed her, something to revive 
And surprise her, she's liver and much more wiser 
Than the light I shine when my brain cells spark, 
Come to me so we can glow in the dark 

And soon, you can represent the moon 
As long as I keep ya in tune 
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here 
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year 

It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun 
We got close and it was almost one 
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go 
Fuck around and miss the show 

So I told her to hold that thought real tight 
We can finish where we left off later on tonite 
Back to the scene of the crime on time 
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme' 

She stood with a birds-eye view of me 
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me 
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom 
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon 

As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row 
So I said ""let's go"" 
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore 
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore 

Besides I got places to go, ladies to see 
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me 
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed 
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said, 

""I've been watchin' you, watchin' me 
Looks I received made it hard to MC 
I can take a hint, so I knew that she 
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-why"" in her bod-why 

Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo 
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm So 
She asked how come I don't smile 
I said, ""Everything's fine, but I'm in a New York state of mind!"" 

As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some 
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some 
Sentimental, songs real gentle, 
It hit the spot and you know where it went to 

As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin' 
I knew she was in the mood for somethin' 
So I laid on my back and relaxed 
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe 

Over me 

[Chorus]",Mahogany,2014
Eric B. & Rakim,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on 
You sweat as you step about to get hype 
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic 

You're physically in this with me but how could you tell 
If it's meant to be hip hop if you're not mentally as well 
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured 
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored 

If you just keep kickin' listen, to the mix 
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand 
Holds and controls you 'til I leave 
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe 

The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then 
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhymes' the oxygen 
Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you 
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue 

And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously 
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be 
Rising to the top, and I came to drop it 
Catch it and quiz it, is my topic 

Universual 'cause I move everybody to come 
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one 
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get 
I draw a crowd, like an architect 

The five borroughs react and all the islands attract 
And every state can't wait, so they attack 
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed 
It'll be more room if MC's play the back 

I'm the are the A to the K-I-M 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make 

I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite 
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like 
The voice on the record, I see what you mean 
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream 

So just, give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it 
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well 
Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells 

I took time to write, tonight I will recite 
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight 
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin 
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin 

Home to tell a friend when the party ends 
""Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"" 
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage, 
Tape by tape and page by page, 

When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix 
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets 
Deeper and Deeper, I hope you understand it 
I made it up myself and I planned it 

For other MC's who waste time 
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme 
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating 
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking 

They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' 
To get up on the microphone and then start takin' 
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it 
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet 

Attracted to a freestyle put in effect 
You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet 
So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) 
Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little,

So Eric B make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch with my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me",Eric B. Is President [Dub],1987
Eric B. & Rakim,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

Thinkin of a master plan
Cuz ain't nuthin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint
So I start my mission- leave my residence
Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents
 
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin move but the money
But now I learned to earn cos I'm righteous
I feel great!  so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin this
Feelin out of place cos, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
Cos I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
To now test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, cos I'm paid in full

Eric B. & Rakim,"Verse one:

Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When i heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on 
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd

Imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger everytime I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric be	 is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

Move the crowd",Move the Crowd [Beatmix by Democratic 3],1987
Eric B. & Rakim,"Follow me into a solo,  get in the flow
And you could picture, like a photo
Music makes mellow, maintains to make
Melodies for MCs, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting; I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it now it's a daily word
I can get illin' at normal killin'
Bambino along, Rakim'll remain calm
Self esteem make me super superb and supreme
Before a microphone, still, I fiend
This was a take, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see 'em keep followin' and swallowin'
Takin' the makin', bitin' and borrowin'
Brothers try and others die to get the formula
But I'm a let 'cha sweat.  You still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posin'
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me, and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel adventitious at speeds around the universe
What could you say as the earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay?
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
As far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare into the darkness, your knowledge: took!
So keep starin', soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the ""R""
This is a lesson.  If you're guessin' and if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'
The Leader
 
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""

Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""

This is a lifetime mission
Vision a prison.  All right, listen
In this journey, you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you movin' 'cause the crowd said so
Dance!  Cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades, bleedin' death.  Call an ambulance!
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murderin' MCs
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
""Follow the Leader!""  ...Yeah, dope!
'Cause every time I stop, you see, just duck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin' and provin' and lettin' knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever.  You disagree?
You say, ""Never?""  Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
Called by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I had to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we were put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
Again, somebody told you, a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed with a
Switch.  Here's a lesson if you're guessin', if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'
The Leader
 
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""

A fear if I freestyle lyrics-a-fury
My third eye make me shine like jury
You're just a rented rapper, you're rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when they fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every trade of my snake so stay awake
And follow and follow 'cause the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to Daddy...  Indeed!
The ""R's"" a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directs the tone then rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin'!  A brother said, ""Dig him?""  I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
It's a danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, to space it, grace it, change the tone
There's one ""R"" in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B., be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state.  Follow us.  Tailgate
Keep comin', but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up your group, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant.  Clap your hands.  You won a trip
The price is right.  Don't make a deal too soon
How many notes?  Could you name this tune?
""Follow the Leader"" is a title they task
Now you know; you don't have to ask
Rappers' rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might get junked if you follow the records he wrecks
Until then, keep eatin' and swallowin'
You better take a deep breath and keep followin'

Eric B. & Rakim,"I'm rated ""R""...this is a warning, ya better void
Poets are paranoid, DJ's destroyed
'Cause I came back to attack others in spite
Strike like lightnin', it's quite frightenin'
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park
Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a spark
Tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up
What's that, lighten up, you see a sight but
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick
Music's the clue, when I come your warned
Apocolypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone
Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer?
This is the death penalty,and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
Friday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street
You come in my realm ya get beat
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry
All ya see is the meters at a volume
Pumping lyrics of fury

Terror in the styles, never error-files
Indeed I'm known-your exiled!
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I ain't a devil and this ain't the exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink
The pain's a migraine every time ya think
Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear
Then the beat is hysterical
That makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is superior
Faces of death remain
MC's decaying, 'cause they never stayed
The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable
Melodies-unmakable, pattern-unecscapable
A horn if want the style I posses
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest
For those that envy a MC it can be
Hazardous to your health so be friendly
A matter of life and death, just like a etch-a-sketch
Shake 'till your clear, make it disappear, make the next
After the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in peace
If not, my soul'll release
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made it
'Cause you're about to see a disasterous sight
A performance never again performed on a mic
Lyrics of fury
",Lyrics of Fury,1988
Eric B. & Rakim,"How could I keep my composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure?
Release, then veins in the brains increase
When I let off, make a wish, and blow the smoke off my piece.
Unloadin', unfold and the rhymes are explodin',
And the mic that I'm holdin's golden.
Cordless, 'cause the wire caught fire like a fuse.
Gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction.
The outcome is there, so listen.
Here's the brief description:
A boom; then flame; then smoke; ashes a dust to dust.
Contact is compact when I bust.
Mc's are now in a massacre;
A disaster a... Master at fashion; a beat to death.
To a pulp, till it can't pump.
Speakers ain't sayin' nothin'.
Now the ball can thump.
As I'm lookin'; I stand like great buildings in brooklyn.
Then the stage is took, then
Havoc struck that could product a whole court.
Keep in touch with the mic when you're holdin', y'all.
Sumpin', and pumpin', and slobbin', and droolin'.
Nothin's pumpin'; who do you think ya foolin'?
Tommy Tucker, the neighborhood sucker;
What you oughtta do... is pick up a tempo
From what I invent, so hard not to bite, but you can't prevent, so
You start to kidnap.
I watch the kid rap.
When he get off he know he shouldn't a did that.
Minor, old-timer, weak-rhymer, stay-in-liner.
You won't be inclined to go, so, yo.
Maybe later you're gonna be,
But for now you're almost one of me.
Now the immature imitations taken from originations;
Made by tracin', and a little arrangin'.
So perform, if ya still ain't warm; maybe after
A roast by the host with the most; it's a musical massacre.

Never tired; don't even try it; keep quiet.
Like a storm, you could rain... but a riot
Remains; the gang's power just like the towerin' inferno.
The beat's gonna burn, so
Distance I kept; you better watch your step.
Volunteers go from here and get
Ya out of the flames.
Appreciate the temperature change.
Anywhere within' the range of Celsius;
Fahrenheit on the mic; mic melts; see it?
Burns soon as it's felt; see it's torchin', scorchin'.
Mic's pipin' hot; steamin' who's schemin'; now ya not.
James Brown must a been dusted,
Disgusted; now he can't be trusted.
Embalmed with fluid.
Static can cause an explosion; in fact, impact's closin' in.
Time was up, so I don't need a time bomb.
Beat gives me a heat-stroke when I rhyme calm.
Pull out the tool; sometimes I want to break, fool.
But I was cool, like one in the chamber;
Lets play a game of rhymin' roulette,
And put me up to your brain and name a rhyme about ya clout.
One mistake... Ya out.
If this imitation it can't be the same show.
Maybe what you'll find somewhere over the rainbow.
Courage, heart, brain, you need rhyme.
Turn on your mic; snap your fingers three times.
We gone, or the story won't end the same,
And you'll feel the flame.
The potion was weak; make another antidote.
What's the science?  Why can't ya quote?
Elements for musical intelligence,
Rhymes are irrelevant; no development
And that settles it.
Go manufacture a match; send me after a blast.
From the master that has to make musical massacre.",Musical Massacre,1988

Three-fourths of water makes seven seas 

A third of land three-sixty degrees 

I circulate and remain to rotate 

Seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate 

Be prepared whenever I come 

Competition is none 

... 

It's no competition 

... 

Creator, the alphabets let's communicate 

When I translate the situation's straight 

No dictionary's necessary to use 

Big words do nothing but confuse and lose 

From the first step, a concept was kept 

To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth 

All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source 

Made by the are, of course 

Seven holes in my face as I'm lookin out my window 

Speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows 

Through the speakers, I hear it so pump this 

And we can fill up the whole circumfrence 

With competition, on an impossible mission 

Comin up with nothin, keep fishin 

No runner up, just lost or forfeits 

They all get butterflies, soon as the dog gets 

Unlocked, lines for blocks and blocks 

Might be triflin, to call the cops 

Bring along paramedics 

But that won't help you, not even calisthetics 

I'm God, G is the seventh letter made 

Rainin on rappers, there's no parade 

So if you ain't wise, then don't even come 

Competition for this inter mixin is none 

... 

It's, no competition

A show from road to road you're entertained 
I don't even have to say my name 
Cause when the place is ripped in half  I'm to blame 
Masses of posses packed up schemin 
Ladies lovely and keep on screamin 
Go Rakim, go Rakim, go 
It won't be long then it's on with the show 
I'm late, so hit the brakes and park the Benzito 
Double oh seven, incognito 
Sneak in the back door, lookin for the stage 
When I get on you react in a rage 
People from side to side and front to back 
won't dance, if the MC's wack 
The crowd go psycho even if I don't move 
Some like the groove cause I'm so smooth 
Then somethin happens, feet start tappin 
You can't hold back when Rakim's rappin

Most of you rappers, can't even rap to this 
I made it faster, you tried to master 
Syncopated styles, words flowin after 
Measures of metaphor definitions of more than one 
Take it both ways, I'll be here when you're done 
Remember as the rhyme goes on it's rougher 
Soon as I stop, you had enough of 
Followin' footsteps, you better turn back soon 
Sucker MC's suck rhymes like vacuums 
The style remains the same, the words is changed 
Bitten, rewritten, recited and rearranged 
Sing along if your tongue is strong, it gets sore 
Sing when I'm gone and it'll break your jaw 
Wisdom flows so swift, I'm Asiatic 
Is it a gift, or automatic 
Static, I don't cling 
I got a tip of my own and I don't sing 
Don't understand, here's an example 
And why MC's and DJ's sample 
'Cause we don't have a band, it's just my voice and his hands 
That's what hip-hop was, it still stands 
The records we use are from mom's and pop's collection 
Find a break from a dope selection 
And go to the store, then buy one more 
So my DJ can mix cause that's what his hands are for 
Years later hip-hop got contracts 
The chance to put actual facts on wax 
A mind's the coach, the physical form's the team 
The top's the destination, I'm the cream 
And still I rise with somethin pumpin and somethin clever

With stacks of verbal attacks so clap your hands 
Rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints 
Students influenced are now a nuisance 
You couldn't fight it, you had to clap to this 
You got excited, you almost snapped your wrist 
The rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment 
When I'm with this you can't toy with 
The def jam juicer rough rhyme producer 
Loads of lyrics get you loose, then looser 
The man so smooth and world so rough 
Eric is throwin and sewin rippin restitchin the cuts 
Microphone your majesty, no one's bad as me 
Seems the tragedy, Rakim had to be 
Thinkin of some def view of a video 
Visions are vicious, and I'll let the city know 
Whoever's frontin they know, nothin to say though 
so lay low, musical forms are kickin' like Kato 
Don't get near it, hard as you ever hear it 
I know it's fearified, but don't fear it 
And try to predict which rhyme you can kick 
You're quick to pick your best, for the mic is lit

Keep you in tune and up to par

From using my instrumental; keep in mind I meant to

Hurry up and learn the words, and repeat it wit' me
Then soon you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doing it wit' the R
Keep doing it; you keep doing it wit' the R

In the summertime, pockets bulging
Somethings's happening, then I'm indulging
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined
Gold grill, a paint job will shine
Pull up in the park, and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm

Eardrums are playing along to what I'm sayin' you're singin' a song 
Stevie Blass on the keyboard  swingin' along 
But you don't have to dance  play it cool and listen 
My DJ's mixin', and I'll do the quizzin' 
'Cause who is number one if not best then better 
Here's a hint: the 18th letter 
The rhymes is sportable, microphone is portable 
For any immortal man, swords is not affordable 
Never take a loss cause I'm hard to beat 
I ain't cheap but don't sell me a dream I don't sleep 
I'm Paid in Full, so save the bull 
This ain't a stick-up, you don't have to wave until 
you feel Sure, and you want more then wipe your sweat 
'Cause I just wanted to see how hype you could get 
'Cause when I came in the door steppin' hard enough to shake the floor 
I just started but the others can't make no more 
Runnin' out of beats breaks and out of time 
If I was gone, you'd be runnin' out of rhymes 
I improve, record don't have to be long 
If it's understood and the story is strong 
You can speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners 
The people is peepless, it's to the listeners 

I'm the Lord, for somethin' you can absorb 
Try and control and be cautious but the cut's in a cord 
Make me deeper than down, I make the crowd, crowd around 
People are peepless, cause the soloist found 
Phrases, thoughts, made by the are of course 
One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours 
You keep talkin', when will all the damage be done? 
You say you're rulin' but when I'm in the place you don't come 
Maybe you're waitin', to see what I'm makin'
One more style gets taken, then I'ma be breakin'
If the patterns are causes, piano is soft 
But make it hard for you to start, where I left off 
You find yourself, till the point is across 
You hit reverse to rewind it, that's when you hit the pause 
I set the scene, first you hear mixin' 
Then the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin? 
Pay close attention, never before mentioned 
Listen up I got a brand new invention 
Made from a musician it's notes are played crisp 
But listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc 
Copywritten but still bitten they almost sound like 
Almost pumpin', but it ain't down like 
A record's supposed to sound, watch as it go around 
Records are broken, smashed into the ground 
That ain't My Melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me 
Others are trying to flow smooth and steadily 
Potholes are left in my path then I crash and bruise 
Whoever refuse and cruise right past em 
'Cause I just left to do it for easy whatever 
Death, till I get back you better stay in step

You were my everything 
Now Id give anything 
To feel the love you bring 
You were my everything

Can fix you up 
But my life will never ever be the same 
Without your touch 
I know you're still afraid to let me in 
And I don't blame you really 
I wouldn't let you see me 
I took for granted you would always be there

When I start flowing, the mic might bust
The next state, I shake from the power I generate
People in Cali used to think it was earthquakes

'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard
So I vote God and never get scarred and gauled
But it seems like I'm locked in hell
Looking over the edge but the are never fell

A trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip
Stand on my own two feet and come equip
Any stage I'm seen on, a mic I fiend on
I stand alone and need nothing to lean on

Going for self wit a long way to go

Now that's what I call hard times

Under the dark skies on a dark side

Before I kick a rhyme, I kick my feet up

Under surveillance, takin over your soul

The performance I give em is, somethin like a hypnotism 

Swingin back and forth, til you can keep the rhythm 

At the tone of my voice, you will become 

eager to listen dance in a trance til you see the 

are on stage, no cheers, all ears 

All three of your eyes on me, so it appears 

just like you thought it would be, but even better 

Live and direct on stage, instead of the 

radio or video or studio rehearsin 

I'm at my best in the flesh in person 

The main attraction, center of attention 

The crowd'll go crazy, soon as I mention 

it's time to communicate, so let's conversate 

I get my point across, when you respond I make sense 

So now we could continue the mission 

As I, keep em eager to listen 



As I, keep em eager to listen 



[Rakim] 

I used to always say one day 

I'll play in the NBA cause I'll slay 

opponents well, and also excel 

as a black quarterback in the NFL 

I throw to score so I can hear the crowd roar 

Keep em, out of they seats and on the floor 

And when I win, it'll pump my adrenaline 

My record is undefeated, and I'll win again 

I'll never lose or hear boos from the audience 

cause they participate, and applaud me since 

I bring em what they want to hear 

And they'll fill up the atmopshere 

with people that came to party, and have a good time 

So when I'm gone, I'm sure, you understood the rhyme 

Because I promise to accomplish the mission 

Cause I, keep em eager to listen",Keep 'Em Eager to Listen,1990
Eric B. & Rakim,"Me and Eric be	 was coolin' at the Paladium 
Seen a all world covered girl  I said ""Hey lady I'm 
Sorry if You're in a rush   Don't let me hold ya up 
Or interveen or interrupt  but

You got the look   I want to get to know ya better 
I had to let her know   but yo  I didn't sweat her 
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein' 
Almost looked Korean  but European. 

When she spoke  her accent was self-explanatory - 
Even her body language told the story 
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony 
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric be"" 

Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk, 
So we could talk and see New York. 
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock 
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't want to stop 

Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same 
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain 
Each mic is a mineral, poetry's protein 
Verse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine 

So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal 
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real 
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist 
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said 

[Chorus] 
Over Me, She's goin' crazy 
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy 
She said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G 
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony 

So I prescribed her, something to revive 
And surprise her, she's liver and much more wiser 
Than the light I shine when my brain cells spark, 
Come to me so we can glow in the dark 

And soon, you can represent the moon 
As long as I keep ya in tune 
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here 
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year 

It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun 
We got close and it was almost one 
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go 
Fuck around and miss the show 

So I told her to hold that thought real tight 
We can finish where we left off later on tonite 
Back to the scene of the crime on time 
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme' 

She stood with a birds-eye view of me 
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me 
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom 
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon 

As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row 
So I said ""let's go"" 
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore 
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore 

Besides I got places to go, ladies to see 
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me 
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed 
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said, 

""I've been watchin' you, watchin' me 
Looks I received made it hard to MC 
I can take a hint, so I knew that she 
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-why"" in her bod-why 

Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo 
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm So 
She asked how come I don't smile 
I said, ""Everything's fine, but I'm in a New York state of mind!"" 

As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some 
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some 
Sentimental, songs real gentle, 
It hit the spot and you know where it went to 

As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin' 
I knew she was in the mood for somethin' 
So I laid on my back and relaxed 
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe 

Over me 

[Chorus]",Mahogany,1990
Eric B. & Rakim,"I'm the Alpha  with no Omega 
Beginning without the  end so play the 
Eye inside  no extended version 
Next episode be smooth as a Persian 
Rhyme everlastin  there'll be no part two 
Knowledge is infinite  once I start to draw 
A better picture for your third eye  if you're blind 
You know with a mic  I'm a black Michaelangelo 
I'm the brother who ideas are colorful 
Givin em insight  but givin em trouble to 
Comprehend cause they thoughts won't blend in 
They're pretendin, while I'm extendin 
You bite like a parasite, ? you attacks 
But you won't strike, cause you ain't no match 
You need more light cause yours got dim 
Then you get sparked by the Lord Rakim 
What's the matter G, check your battery 
Go get charged up, then come battle me 
You try hard and Die Hard, you ain't Eveready 
When they check the pulse, you'll be +Dead+ as +Freddie+ 
Sharper spears for new ideas 
Check your engine and ask your engineers 
To equalize, try to disguise it 
If that don't work yo, then monosize it 
You need more power, better bring Battlecat 
But this ain't Grayskull, and you ain't rippin jack 
Don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley 
(""Bring it to me!"") 
We can go rhyme for rhyme til the mic stop the workin 
Then I'ma leave you behind the Iron Curtain 
And you'll remain backstage 
Your book is over, I ripped your last page 
Changed the endin, at least you went out rappin 
Now I'ma tell em what happened 
I filled the mic with explosives, and lit it up 
It was too heavy to hold, he couldn't pick it up 
Pass the mic, let him try to get paid 
He hit the stage, it went off like a hand grenade 
Now scrape him off the floor and off my list 
I ain't a soloist, I'm an arsonist 
Sprayed up, he said he was gonna do what? 
Played up, MC Grand but Pooh-Butt 
Stole his lady, and drove her crazy 
You asked me why - cause her man tried to play me 
I sent her back a nervous wreck 
And tried to put her back in check 
My speciality is masterin the female species 
I specialize in her, until she sees 
Where I come from, and why I came 
I tame the train til she manifest my name 
Fill her with life until she burst with energy 
Then leave her restless, cause a lot of women be 
Tryin to drain us, and leave us stripped dry 
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly 
I clipped your wings and bring you down to Earth 
And tell you what life is worth 
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic 
You want to pip on, imperialist with 
Food for thought, cause I'm the shelter 
I'll be your clothes, keep you warm and help ya 
Not to be hot to trot by a haunt 
And why do y'all got to flaunt? 
(""You gotta use what you got 
To get what you want"") 
Cool, I heat you up like a black mink coat 
Hug your neck like a fat gold rope 
Words I speak and my DJ's cuts will warm ya ears 
Like mink earmuffs 
So Eric show em how fast your hand'sll go 
So the people in the stands'll know 
That you don't scratch your cuts in the grave 
Moves in waves to my rhyme displays 
Float, evoke, my tempo jets 
Expressions express when you kick steps 
Keep em, energetic, so let it 
Pound in your head til what I said is embedded 
Don't forget it's copastetic, set it 
Anywhere you want your poetry's pathetic 
You gets.. no.. credit.. til you get it straight 
Let's motivate 
No intermissions cause it ain't commercial 
If you want to break then I'll reimburse you 
I won't let go so my mic won't drop, cause 
(""I can't.. stop!"") 
Vocabs is endless, vocals exist 
Rhyme goes on, so no one can stop this 
Especially when I start to say the 
Rhymes with no omega

Eric B. & Rakim,"Here I go again ready to flow again
Better hold my mic don't blow again
Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm
Crowd'll get critical can't keep calm
Jet for the exit why hang around
Words that I found make the mic melt down
If you stay better cooperate 'cause I amputate
And whoever don't break I'm a suffocate
Leave 'em with asthma, you better pass the
Mic to the massacre master who has the
Power to build and destroy at the same time
So track the wack at the right, and exact could shine
Meant to beat overheat, but I won't stop
So evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
Switch it from one hand to another
And that's a hint, my brother, run for cover
'Cause I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb
As if I escaped from Vietnam
Some people label me lethal, lyrics I made then put beats to
Format, collapse, your lungs twist your tongues
You can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
Words that I made'll create an iller scene
Eric B. is the fly human being on the guillotine
Hook 'em up to a respirator, 'cause it's the mista suffocator
What I write is like shovin' a mic down your windpipe
Don't let him bit rhymes Rakim write
No mic to mouth resuscitation is necessary
No obituary, and if they're left, they're buried
As it strikes on the same mic twice and then
Cut it on, and I'm a strike again
I meditate off the breaks, till the place shakes
Then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes
Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother
The stage is stompin' grounds
Run for cover

Evacuate the building, danger, 'cause I came to explain the 
Strategy that'll be tragic automatically
Havin' me to cause another catastrophe
All you gotta do is give Rakim the microphone
And the crowd'll yell ""Timber"" 
Buildings collapsin', rappers gettin' trapped in
Areas closed off, no one gets back in
So set up roadblocks, barricade the doors
Fade, put a detour sign on the stage
Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use and been usin' ever since
The days in the park when, rap was an art then
Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned
Makin' it hard to walk the streets at night
For those who talk the weak beats on the mic
Whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage
Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge
Surround by sound of the beat-down another brother
This is stompin' grounds, run for cover
Wheels or foot, better not stay put
Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
Then you've got seven minutes to vacate the premises
Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
Don't act wild, single file to the door
No need for an encore, just clear the floor
'Cause my mic's about to self destruct
The stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
'Cause minutes from now it won't be standin'
Then send out and A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a brother like me
Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture
How many bitin' MCs can I capture
Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
Take over their route, play 'em out like a Cub Scout
So leave troopin' for MCs at war
And if it's a battle let the crowd keep score
'Cause me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother

I came to set em straight  and let em know 

Whoever's holdin the best  just let him go 

Cause here's the inside scoop on the fiend 

They want to know why I'm seldom seen 

Cause who needs the TV screens and magazines 

or shootin through the city in fly limousines 

There's one thing I don't like  it's the spotlight 

.. cause I already got light 

They be like  ""Yo we had a get together last week 

and we know everyone was there except the Black Sheik"" 

Because my schedule is tight, I gotta write 

I'm deep in the archives, and keepin em hyped 

It's been a long time, since you heard a strong rhyme 

None of these are weak so when you bite on mine 

we can trace the hits and then name that style 

MC'sll be out of a job for a while 

I reposess your indentification 

So hand in your application 

Put your mic on strike until you're unemployed 

Contract is up and I'm stampin it void 

Your selection ain't that selective 

So I'ma put you in your proper perspective 

On the dancefloor, and doin the SHAKE 

Ready to let em brake, set em straight 



[Rakim] 

Somebody said I set em up and pulled the plug on em 

But instead I let em go on so I could bug on em 

Go 'head and flow, cause I close the show 

Swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow 

For instance.. once I commence.. 

.. the crowd is convinced 

So now you know who to put your money on 

Hurry up, before your money's gone 

Cause I'm the most common denominator 

Orchestrate a rhyme much greater 

I'm like a world almanac, so tell the media 

Givin em information like encyclopedia 

So bring a dictionary, so you can look it up 

so you know what I mean, when I hook it up 

No misconceptions although I complicate 

but this concept'll set em straight 

They even said that I was locked in jail 

So now I guess I'm out on bail? 

The only Island I was on was the Strong one 

And if I did my bid, it'll be a long one 

Cause if I sold weight, I'd be upstate 

in the penile, waitin for a brake 

Cause sellin drugs is for handicaps 

I got too many skills besides bustin rough raps 

If I go to jail, it won't be for sellin ki's 

It'll be for muderin MC's 

The beat'll take over your heart, then I start 

to cut em in half, cause rhymes are razor sharp 

Secure the exits, all MC's remain 

Cause we got a crowd to entertain 

And I know, when I go, I'll flow dangerous 

Brain'sll bust, what you tryin to explain to us? 

You got lost, and couldn't go on 

Came up short, so here's one to grow on 

Elevate off a high IQ 

In time, you'll find I'm true 

Cause once I start on a piece of art 

from sun to moon and light to dark I build the Ark 

Now you can float off the rhymes I wrote 

I'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat 

You could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked 

Attacked with a torpedo, what did you expect? 

Driftin up the creek, without a beat or a paddle 

Castaway on a raft and stand fragile 

Rescue your crowd, which ain't a hard job 

Me and my knowledge put together, I'm a lifeguard 

Dealin with actual facts it sold out fat 

here and now, but I go so far back 

to bring you up to date, so we can elevate 

It's no time to wait, or anticipate

So I can let em brake, and set em straight",Set 'Em Straight,1990
Eric B. & Rakim,"See if you can step to this

(Back to the lab)

Now try to do this step (Back to the lab)
And make sure the pace is kept
And this ain't as smooth as I'ma get
Nice and easy but hard to catch on to
Move with melodies, rhymes to respond to
The mic's in front of me, so you know it's gonna be
Rough and rugged, plus I'm smooth as I wanna be
I'm somethin' like sippin' on Dom Perignon
So absorb the song, til the rhyme's all gone
My beats and speech original, you can't find these
Eighty-nine is mine, so is the nineties
Tellin you what you need to know and more
You're unsure? On tour, I explore
From street to street, to speak, from beat after beat
My cypher's complete, when I build with people I meet
So here's the info straight from the source in fact
Paid the cost to be the boss, step back!
Give me room to exercise the mind
Three-hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
The weight of the world is what we hold
That's a six, followed by twenty-one zeroes
Six ? sums is a lot of weight
My truth is the strength and my thought won't break
What it take, concentration, to rebuild our
Nation but we got to have mind power
And we can make it work, because I know we can
And if somethin' go wrong, make another plan
It's up to us, so strive and be wise and
When we reach the top, don't stop risin'
And I'll keep comin' up with more of
The most requested songs that you all love
Reach out and touch the mic, take control
Still gettin' ""Paid"" and I still got ""Soul""
And the only thing I ever wanted you to follow was poetry
Mind takes X-rays, so listen closely
From the darkness came the light, clear out of a dark night
Now I'm here to spark the mic
Send out truth, for other groups and substitutes
With run-on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
They'd rather hear the arsonist, they insist
No need to reminisce, see if you can step to this

Step back

(Back to the lab)

(Back to the lab, without a mic to grab)

So just step

(Back to the lab)

(Back to the lab, without a mic to grab)

Just step, the rhymes create energy
Charged up, by the cut, and it's sendin' me
For a trip through the mind so I can locate
A laid back rap at a slow rate
It ain't hard at all, cause I invented it
As the days go on, you hear them with it
Brother bustin' braincells, thinkin' of a rap
With the same old style, we had enough of that
We all need somethin' to step to
And don't forget to, cause I won't let you
Dance without hopin' that this come on next
And if it go off, the DJ can't flex
Cause here's the tempo, I'ma regulate the pace
Here's the step, go find some space
And what we gonna do is in unison, kick!
Shake your head, you're influenced with music
By now you're intoxicated, cause I prove I made it
The pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated
From side to side, you pause and clap
But if you came to rap (step back)

Eric B. & Rakim,"This is poetry in motion 
Try to catch on  stay close to the host 
And MC's try to make the road rough but I'm coastin 
Ladies hear the rhymes rub em on like lotion 

Hit spots soothin  can't stop movin 
Go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still coolin 
When I detain it's a brainstorm 
Never the same form  every brain I rained on is warm 

Takin a trip through Memory Lane to Melody 
See if you could tell if these thoughts to fell MC's 
Could do you justice, but you can't touch this 
Some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed 

I'm universal and much more merciful 
So versatile with the style it's reversible 
I get away even if I say a curse or two 
First, let me bust another verse for you 

Your arms too short to box with Ra so quit 
You don't want no kind of conflict 
Or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped 
Pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah I'm hip 

Everything I said flows since my intro 
I plant a thought extend and then grow 
Holdin' my pen tightly it might be 
Controversy at first when I write the 

Chords of research don't just take it for granted 
When I'm gone my mind remains a planet 
If I keep buildin, and teach the children 
So when they read in between the lines it's filled in 
I break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate 
Till I'm deep awake, but not asleep 
At the same time risin and advertisin 

What is true, keep advised and you can stay wise 
And I'm untouchable 

Comin' over the bridge take a peak at the skyline 
'Cause that's how I shine not only when I rhyme 
My culture's makin me stronger, mentally 
Physically I'm powerful poetry now that could be 

Labelled as art placed in a museum 
Style'll make scenery, now you see 'em 
Exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with 
Nothin illiterate it's facts I build with 

My mind's untouchable which means intangible 
Contents never dense it's understandable 
I study life so I can live it the right way 
No time to hear what another brother might say 

Why sell a capsule of crack I don't have to 
I rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to 
Put message on records that's graced with hard bass 
Smugglin' microphones, this ain't Scarface 

Whoever talked that talk, I want to hawk 
And don't try to Escape From New York 
Cross a 110th Street lookin for a problem 
It's Hell Up In Harlem, watch Ra solve em 

I hear the music clear as I get near 
The hundred and twenty fifth street Apollo Theater 
Take a step back when I rap I step up to you... 
I'm untouchable 

Put on my thinking cap pump the track 
Test your reflex relax but in contact 
You fold and lose control so hold your partner closer 
You're supposed to keep your composure 

But you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype 
It's like nitro opponents get petro 
Remember the trademark left by the are 
That's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest 

In effect, you could die-tect the imposter 
Takin my props, Rakim is still proper 
I'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it 
Everything I say, coincide with the topic 

Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured 
Inside my brain it's all manufactured 
As we go deeper it's hard to find 
Don't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind 

It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined 
In the mind with some kind of idea for 
The style I'm advertisin what is true 
Keep advised that you stay wise and the mind 

Is untouchable",Untouchables,1990
Eric B. & Rakim,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon
As you hear it  pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Detects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme
I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you want to get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it",I Know You Got Soul,1990
Eric B. & Rakim,"Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano

Bring a bullet proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
Now what the trigger say

Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through

Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady
Say don't lose me

So reload quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin'
This fifi get wit' me

You steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me

Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But watch the God get

Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast

Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't thirty-eight
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate

Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' 'em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma

Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I

Reduced the friction
With crucifixion
Let loose the mix
Then boost the piston

Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that

I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm
Hit another M.C.

Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when

Music is louder
Full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of

Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss

But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines
That I have to hit

Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up

You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate
And nothing's equivalent

Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around
To rob with a army

You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em,
Soon as I inject 'em

With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in

Let it split 'em
Since he brought his main man wit' 'em
He ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass

Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance

The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here
Let me introduce you

Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy

Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a havoc

If ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention, follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose

Too many milligram
But what made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man

Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'em, he'll never forget 'em
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em

At least when he left he'll know what hit 'em
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, catch up, hell no

Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it

Perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'

Blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein, then remain, let it radiate

Vibes will vibrate, why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style break
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone

Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach your intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my write reflect

Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er

",Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em,1991
Eric B. & Rakim,"I seen her in the subway on my way to Brooklyn 
Hello good looking is this seat tooken 
On the A train picking at her brain 
I couldn't get her number I couldn't get her name 
I said I still like your style of fashion 
But I hate your hostile 'itty attitude wit a passion 
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot 
Is it because your sign don't talk a lot 
She turned away no play I said OK 
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day 
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight 
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night 
Next stop was mine, a familiar scene 
I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green 
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel 
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel 
See I don't bend and I won't rust 
And I don't break and I won't bust 
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat? 
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete 
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me 
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me? 
Hm, I didn't want to play myself out 
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout 
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by 
She came in the store then she even said hi 
Curiosity at a high velocity 
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me 
I said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine 
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time 
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find, 
I want to know what's on your mind 

About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello"" 
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no 
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't want to stress you 
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you 
See I want to get to know you so I can show you 
What a strong relationship can grow to 
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me 
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me 
Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple 
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you 
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions 
Next you see ectacy's explosions 
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time 
I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime 
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find

I want to know what's on your mind 
I want to know what's on your mind 

Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely 
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me 
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams 
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen 
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown 
How do the 125th street sound 

Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo 
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow 
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate 
Every word is an instrument 
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans 
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones 
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring 
It's always a new song to sing 
The next day I went back to the her rest 
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse 
She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on 
Smelling like Liz Claiborne 
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables 
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you 
I got the feeling for sexual healing 
A mental healing how you feeling 
She caught the effect and said she feel the same 
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain 
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning 
You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learning 
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world 
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl
Take it easy, cut off the TV 
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me, 
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find 
'Cause now I know what's on your mind
'Cause now I know what's on your mind",What's on Your Mind?,1991
Eric B. & Rakim,"Casualties of War! 



Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade 

Where's the enemy? Who do I invade? 

Bullets of Teflon  bulletproof vest rip 

Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips 

Cause I got a family that waits for my return 

To get back home is my main concern 

I'ma get back to New York in one piece 

but I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets 

Sky lights up like fireworks blind me 

Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me... 

President Bush said attack 

Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back 

Missile hits the area, screams wake me up 

from a war of dreams, heat up the M-16 

Basic training, trained for torture 

Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya 

Addicted to murder, send more bodybags 

They can't identify em, leave the nametags 

I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor 

CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X) 



Day divides the night and night divides the day 

It's all hard work and no play 

More than combat, it's far beyond that 

Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack 

Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego 

Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go 

But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall? 

Somebody give the President a call 

But I hear warfare scream through the air 

Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare 

A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme 

Something like Monopoly: a government scheme 

Go to the Army, be all you can be 

Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me 

So I start letting off ammunition in every direction 

Allah is my only protection 

But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same 

and this is Asia, from where I came 

I'm on the wrong side, so change the target 

Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant? 

Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America 

Now it's mass hysteria 

I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor 

CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X) 



The war is over, for now at least 

Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace 

It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about 

Whole generation, left in doubt 

Innocent families killed in the midst 

It'll be more dead people after this 

So I'm glad to be alive and walkin 

Half of my platoon came home in coffins 

Except the general, buried in the Storm 

in bits and pieces no need to look for em 

I played it slick and got away with it 

Rigged it up so they would think they did it 

Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet 

when THEY call, I'm going AWOL 

Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war 

when I don't know who or what I'm fighting for 

So I wait for terrorists to attack 

Every time a truck backfires I fire back 

I look for shelter when a plane is over me 

Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G 

Kamikaze, strapped with bombs 

No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam 

Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? 

No time to wonder, somebody's going under 

Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge 

Take control, cause I'm in charge 

When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor

Eric B. & Rakim,"Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Let's trace the hint and check the file
Let's see who bent and detect the style
I flip the script so it can't get foul
At least not now it'll take a while
I changed the pace to complete the beat
I drop the base 'til mc's get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep 
Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique

I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Party's, clubs and for cars and jeeps
The underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

They wanna know how many times 
I ripped and wrecked 
But the search is never found of the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces took the last to observe them
They couldn't absorb them
They didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience
Ears, for my opponents, it might take years
Pencil, pens, and swords 
Letters put together from a key to cause
I'm also a sculpture form with structure
Because of my culture I'm equipped to construct a
Technical style that'll be full of technology
Complete sights of new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek and peep the technique
Don't sweat the technique

I speak in discreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then completes
Compose with physique never weak or obsolete
They never grow old technique's become antique
Better then something brand new cause it's original
In a while the style, I have much more value
Classical to intelligent to be radical
Masterful never irrelevant mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years you taught to sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Eric B. & Rakim,"She asked could I keep the beat 
So here's the beat  every time it pounds  you get weak 
Comfy  embedded like a pillow  bouncing wit an echo 
My voice is moist  and plus mellow 
I got it going on  you're gonna want to come 
Skins is the drum, I said I'm the drummer  give the drummer some 
And we'll see if you can hang wit Ra 
Let's see if you can Shangri-La 
Easy... Like Tina Marie I play it slick 
Like Rick James, I'm the fire in your desires flames; 
I heat up your temperature, keep the tempo raw 
When you start to smoke, rest assured 
I start to think 'cause you're a singer like Anita 
High pitched like a tweeter, deep beats start to beat her 
Much harder than love taps, my rap's above that 
I get girls where I want wit a maze full of love traps 
But I don't want to fall in love 
I stand in love, good balanced wit a plan to shove 
A cappella as we start to speak 
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat 

[Chorus:] 

Tempo's moving and I'm hoping it'll never fade away... 
The beat is grooving, words are soothing and please tell 
Me that you're here to stay 
In the morning and I'm hoping the morning come again 
Hold me close and give me another dose and 
Keep the beat don't ever let it end 

She said, ah, so far, you didn't miss a beat yet 
Pop in another cassette, then I'm in to wreck 
I'll give you a beat you never had before, 
I had to explore and came up wit more 
Deep trunk kicks wit a brick for a drum stick 
You know the song, don't hum along, come quick 
You lay like Sade, it feels like paradise 
At the top of the pyramid, we review new heights 
The scenery of Egypt, you and me as we get 
So deep in the groove, when you move, you get seasick 
You seen enough, close your eyes and relax 
Move wit the tracks and stay tuned for the sax 
The instrumental, enters your mental.. 
Tense but gentle and, sentimental, 
A cappella as we start to speak 
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat 

 
She wanted the extended version 
So I kept splurging and add more words in 
Strong, the emotion, notions move and 
The poetry's smoking, potions soothing, 
There goes the moon, I'm far from done, 
Rise like the sun, here comes the sun 
And I won't stop 'till it sets and then 
Rewind the cassettes and I'm a play it again; 
But this time it's instrumental at a faster tempo 
All I want to hear is ""Yea Rakim, Go""! 
I work overtime on your body and mind 
Cause I'm incline to do both combined 
My job is never done but done well

If you like it accapella; soul clap will be sweet  

Almost complete. 

Feel the impact when it hit the street 

But uh  it sound thicker when I kick it wit a beat 

See I can let it speak for itself 

But every now and then  I need a little help 

Guess who  to the rescue ? Comp! 

Ripping up comp  I step and then stomp 

A spark scam'll skin the land like it's a Timberland 

Prepare the stage for Rakim to stand 

Then I pick a song, grab the mic, click it on 

Time to get it on, kick along 

See if you can move to the words I speak 

Pick up on a rhythm (kickin' wit da beat) 

My menta-llect gets warm, feed into your physical form 

You can't keep calm 

Get fit to the skit, try to hop on- 

Get up to the trick as I flip the script 

You're feeling rust like a thrust of an arrow, plus, 

You're looking through the eye of a barrel, Bus! 

Emergency! Take him to the operating room, 

Put him on the floor, let his heart feel the boom 

React to the wrath of a brand new song 

Then kick along

A kick is a hip wit hop 

A pep wit step like the floor is hot 

I project a lot so you can use every kick you got 

But don't forget, don't kick when I stop 

I'm something like Simon says 

As I'm pumping hype rhymes in your heads 

The mic's a remote control and I'm pointing it at cha 

When I push buttons, you're gonna have ta 

Break straight to the floor 

'Cause I'm a make more 

Each one's composed in the shows 

And each one flows, how long, nobody knows 

And whoever try to take 'em, I'm a break 'em 

Drag it out of him, dehydrate 'em 

The beat makes the beat in your heart accelerate 

Your pulse is a drumroll, it's too late to wait 

A pen'll send adrendaline to ten 

If then begin to blend the smooth that's sent; 

That's to prevent you from getting asthma 

you try to keep up, because, the cut has ya 

Blood pressure to the point, never stops a drop 

Putting stain in the veins in the brain, ya blood clots! 

Too quick to pause it, you almost lost it 

So kick along to you're all exhausted 

And look what my data made! my power'll never fade 

I keep it energetic, or hype as Gatorade... 

Now kick it wit a beat 

c'mon, kick along 



Kick along(3x) 



They can't wait to kick steps to this 

So I make a skit just for kicks 

Syncopated, pausing though, 

Innovated 'cause the flow 

Melodic and melodramatic styles occur, 

Like a choreographer, my mind's a photographer 

Making music visible for the individual 

That gets visual 

What I manifest you express on the dance floor 

Pants get torn when the jam is on 

'Cause I kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back 

It's hard to kick that, where did'cha get that 

Here's the concept, part of you're concert 

Expect the expert to perfect and do work. 

Don't stop the song 'til I'm gone 

keep getting it on, kick it off with the horns

Like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic, 
If ya curse me, it ain't no mercy, 
Give him a autopsy, killed by a verse of me, 
I took a kid and cut off his eyelid, 
Kill him slow so he could see what I did, 
And if he don't understand what I said, 
I'm pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head 
So he can see what he's getting into, 
A part of the mind that he never been through, 
A journey is coming 'cause ya getting sent to 
A place harder to find but it's all in the mental, 
I ran a brainscan to locate his game plan, 
When I'm through with his brain he ain't the same, man! 
Did he lose his mind or lost in his mind, 
But this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find 
Your foundation; coasting, your mind is 
Drifting, in slow motion..frozen, 
Looks like another murder at the Mardi Gras, be	! 
Too late to send out a search party, 
Once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back,

Dangerous rhymes (are) performed like surgery, 
Cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy, 
My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex, 
Your cerebellum is next! 
Your conscience becomes sub-conscious, 
Soon your response is nonsense
The last words are blurred, mumbled then slurred, 
Then your verbs are no longer heard, 
You get your lung fried so good you're tongue-tied, 
The couldn't swing or hang so he hung 'till he died, 
Reincarnate him, and kill him again, again and again, again and again
I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him, 
I got a dead-MC'ing museum, 
When I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em, 
You can't save 'em...there's no ultamatum, 
Mic's lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes,

Up front, laid back, coming off on track 
Girls want some of this because I'm all of that 
Sweat the concept as the ?(epps)? in depth 
As the track is kept, you can't intercept the step 
React and projects and it tracks and it gets 
To the max and in depth, it attacks but it's relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep, it's relax wit pep",Relax With Pep,1992
Eric B. & Rakim,"Double oh seven is back... 
Double oh seven is back... 

Double oh seven is back... 

[Rakim] 
I don't stress my day cause it's best to parlay 
I guess you could say I've been away 
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant 
And fourteen hands comb New York for fans 
They make waves as they wiggle in my water bed 
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread 
A mornin massage turnin into a real rough rubdown 
So I figured I'll lay around 
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti 
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me 
They know more than calisthenics as they worked up a sweat 
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet 
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean 
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean 
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi 
I said, ""I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me 
Support my thoughts, cause I got a lot of writing to do"" 
They said, ""Cool,"" and just enjoyed the view 
It ain't hard cause it's miles from the sidewalk 
I'm overlooking every borough in New York 
The entire, Empire, State to concentrate 
For every rhyme I make 
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune 
And just before they all cleared the room 
They said, ""We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure 
We wish you didn't have to leave no more"" 
But they want to go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door 
Double oh seven is back... 
Rest assured 

Double oh seven is back... 
Feel secure 
Double oh seven is back... 

I'm fillin up the page when I'm steppin on stage 
Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air 
Fellas sayin HO, everybody yellin GO 
Fly ladies in the house all screamin ""Aww yeah"" 
That's how they react when I attack the mic 
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright 
Girls love to squeeze me real tight 
Double oh seven is back.. 
Ra has returned, to romance em, better than Johnny Handsome 
When I was young, women said, ""Damn son"" 
Ain't nuthin change but the year and I'm still here 
Come here dear and let me whisper in your ear 
Hug my words so I can taste your lips 
I set up hips like domino chips 
But I don't let em hit the floor 
And if you got sore, then feel secure 
Where's the pain, is it the spot you set us in 
Almost magic, better than medicine 
Take one of these and put your mind at ease 
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s 
If I'm hawkin New York, or out on tour 
I express the raw dialect and explore 
But don't get fooled by metaphor 
Double oh seven is back 
Rest assured 

Feel secure 
Rest assured 
Rest assured 
Yo, feel secure",Rest Assured,1992
Eric B. & Rakim,"No more time to pass time 'cause these are the last rhymes  
'Cause we're living in the last times... 
They want to go to war  more wars to come 
But most of us fight more wars than one 

Discrimination in the racial nation 
While they destroy our strong foundation 
Nature's balance is way off balance 
They tip the scale  now it's no more silence 

The hole in the ozone layer is outta control 
But they want to fight for more oil and gold 
Unemployment, I got laid off 
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off 

For more, more mint, no doe for rent 
I gotta shed blood to make a red cent 
Maybe I should ask the president 
Somebody give me the president 

But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question 
'Cause in my section it's worse than recession 
So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood 
Take from the bad and give to the good 

First I go to Bensonhurst, steal a Benz, snatch a purse 
Pick up my friends, that's when it gets worse 
'Cause I need government and they need government 
a lot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent 

Who makes the most dead presidents in the projects 
You're gonna get robbed and wrecked 
I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot 
Let's get him for all he got 

I approached him slow like I was a basehead 
Put the fo-fifth to his face and said 
You see those kids over there wit the hoods 
Walk to them real slow and give them the goods 

First the gun and the doe and crush the jumbos 
One false move and no one knows 
'Cause I got a silencer to hush the bust 
And I'm in a rush, so hush the fuss 

Plus the poison you fed will no longer spread 
You good as dead, I'm a fill your head wit lead 
That's when I pushed him into his building 
To murder him but I remember the children

chorus: 

We gotta teach the children everyday, keep a song 

Show them the light, teach them right from wrong 

Make some sense so they can carry on 

Teach the children 

We gotta teach the children so that they can sing along 

Understand the words in this song 

Can't be done when we're gone, so..."" 



Teach the children ,save the nation 

I see the destruction, the situation 

They're corrupt, and their time's up soon 

But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon 

Sounds like Total Recall 

But who gotta spaceship, you get it, we fall 

So hope for the best and expect the worst 

The end is near and it's you-N-I verse... 

The one's that interfere wit nature 

Labeled you limited and underrate ya, 

His plans over rule when he separates ya 

Now it's you-N-I verse, the one that hates ya 

So we gotta let them know, we're hip to the script 

Change the skit, or we're about to flip 

'Cause we want access to happiness 

Livin' the good life and much success 

Equal opportunity 

Self awareness and unity 

Education, the kids need a sculpture 

Teach them the abacus and their culture... 

And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing 

Poison neighborhoods are illing 

But they import more keys from across seas 

A drug disease hits the streets wit ease 

So keep on building.... 'cause we gotta keep building 

Till the answers are filled in 

And make sure you don't stop till then... 

And if you do, remember the children!",Teach the Children,1992

What's happening  it's been so long  what's going on 
And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone 
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man 
You invented a scam even you don't understand 

You rig the enigma  can't figure it out 
You change the route  now you're in doubt 
You use to cut class  smoked grass  still passed  
Figured you was all that but that ain't last; 

The times is harder, the drugs is heavier 
You say whatever, the more, the merrier; 
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes, 
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes; 

No more good times, no more time, 
Too far to find, you're almost blind, 
You can't see what spot that the trap is in
(Hey bra!)What's happening! 

You had it mapped out, your plans get torn, 
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone 
You said you quit, stated your word is bond 
(Hey bro) what's going on? 

What's going on? 

My neighborhood don't look so good 
I'll find a way out.. yeah, I would if I could, 
But the government is doing a project 
so I live in the projects; 

Where we fight for elbow room to the doom, 
Try to live long but you die too soon, 
I might not be alive to see 25, 
Taught at ten to make money and strive; 

I sold tapes at school and made some ends 
Met a lot of skins and even made some friends, 
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit, 
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit; 

But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test, 
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress! 
And then shake hands like a man, 
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand! 

But you had a one on one fight wit drugs, 
When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs, 
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone 
(Hey bra!) what's going on? 

Yo, what's going on? 

The crime rate in New York State elevate, 
A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate, 
Drug wars daily, a lot of blood spilt, 
Kids on the playground shot down and kilt! 

Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more
'Cause stray bullets explore! 
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely, 
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be 

Rubbed out in a quest for clout 
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out! 
Half of the projects is dead or locked up, 
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up. 

Human abortion create distortions
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when 
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born!

Thinkin of a master plan

'cause ain't nuthin but sweat inside my hand

So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent

So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint

So I start my mission- leave my residence

Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents

I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid

So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin funny

Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin move but the money

But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous

I feel great! so maybe I might just

Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive

Then maybe I'll stay alive

So I walk up the street whistlin this

Feelin out of place 'cause, man, do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of

Me and Eric be	, and a nice big plate of

Fish, which is my favorite dish

But without no money it's still a wish

'cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid

So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made

Turn up the bass  check out my melody  hand out a cigar 

I'm lettin knowledge be born  and my name's the are 

A k i m not like the rest of them  I'm not on a list 

That's what I'm sayin  I drop science like a scientist 

My melody's in a code  the very next episode 

Has the mic often distortin  ready to explode 

I keep the mic in Fahrenheit  freeze MC's and make em colder 

The listener's system is kickin like solar 

As I memorize, advertise, like a poet 

Keep you goin when I'm flowin, smooth enough, you know it 

But rough that's why the middle of my story I tell E.B. 

Nobody beats the ""are"", check out my melody... 



[Verse Two:] 



So what if I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I sing 

One of these for MC's so they don't have to scream 

I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test 

Then let my melody play, and then the record suggest 

That I'm droppin bombs, but I stay peace and calm 

Any MC that disagree with me just wave your arm 

And I'll break, when I'm through breakin I'll leave you broke 

Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke 

So stand back, you want to rap? All of that can wait 

I won't push, I won't beat around the bush 

I want to break upon those who are not supposed to 

You might try but you can't get close to 

Because I'm number one, competition is none 

I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun 

Whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall 

I just writin my name in graffiti on the wall 

You shouldn't have told me you said you control me 

So now a contest is what you owe me 

Pull out your money, pull out your cut 

Pull up a chair, and I'ma tear shit up 

My name is Rakim Allah, and are & A stands for ""Ra"" 

Switch it around, but still comes out ""are"" 

So easily will I e-m-see-e-e 

My repetition of words is ""check out my melody"" 

Some bass and treble is moist, scratchin and cuttin a voice 

And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice 

I wouldn't have came to set my name around the same weak shit 

Puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit 

In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone 

I take this more serious than just a poem 

Rockin party to party, backyard to yard 

Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods 





[Verse Three: ]



The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp 

I can swing off anything even a string of a harp 

Just turn it on and start rockin, mind no introduction 

Til I finish droppin science, no interruption 

When I approach I exercise like a coach 

Usin a melody and add numerous notes 

With the mic and the are-a-k-i-m 

It's a task, like a match I will strike again 

Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped 

Put in order to pursue with the momentum except 

I say one rhyme and I order a longer rhyme shorter 

A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder 



[Verse Four: ]



I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor 

Melody arranger, poet, etcetera 

Extra events, the grand finale like bonus 

I am the man they call the microphonist 

With wisdom which means wise words bein spoken 

Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin 

I came to express the rap I manifest 

Stand in my way and I'll lead a ??? words protest 

MC's that want to be dissed they're gonna 

Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta 

All they can go get is me a glass of Moet 

A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet 

I take 7 MC's put em in a line 

And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme 

Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine 

And that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time 

Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin 

No fessin, no messin around, no chewin 

No robbin, no buyin, bitin, why bother 

This slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow 

My unusual style will confuse you a while 

If I was water, I flow in the Nile 

So many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's 

Just because of a cause I have to pause 

Right after tonight is when I prepare 

To catch another sucka duck MC out there 

'cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe 

And after this you'll call me your majesty 

My melody... 





[Verse Five: ]



Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it 

Eric be	 made a cut and advertised it 

My melody's created for MC's in the place 

Who try to listen 'cause I'm dissin 

Take off your necklace, you try to detect my pace? 

Now you're buggin over ?off my rhyme like bass 

The melody that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin 

Rough enough to break New York from Long Island 

My wisdom is swift, no matter if 

My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff 

I'm genuine like leather, don't try to be clever 

MC's you'll beat the ""are"", I'll say ""Oh never"" 

So Eric be	 cut it easily 

And check out my melody...",My Melody,1996
Eric B. & Rakim,"Have you ever been stabbed in the back
By someone you thought was really cool
Did they steal your heart or was it money
Or was it lies they told
Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again ?cause now you know

That friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind
Never know what's on their mind
Could be true deception
Jealousy and envy reign
They never want to see you get ahead
They just hold you back

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend, oh, oh

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Friends are hard to find, so be careful
You could find an inch or mile if I pay you
But some ain't that bad, but one might back stab
To get the fake tips of what one might have
Bite the hand that feeds you, leave the people who need you
For those who hold you back and mislead you
To be a needle, don't get lead on unleaded
The wrong direction, a dead end's next then
Heed the detour, life's like a seesaw
The ups and downs, and I'll bet there'll be more
Potholes and obstacles in our path, that's righteous
At times you need a hand to fight this
Way of life, straighten up, take the door to the placid
And don't you act two-faced
?Cause jealousy and envy, and you still act friendly
You could find the end and pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, yeah

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Used to me kiss me, tell me you missed me
But now you try to glaze me, play me and diss me
Uh, wide awake, ready to break, so we argue
What happened to the kisses, and, ""Why, how are you?""
Forgot about the times when I rhymed when I bathed you
Dreams was the only little things that I gave you
You still ain't thankful, you're still complainin'
Used to be a quiet storm, but now it's rainin'
Farther than ever, I'm thinkin' whether
If we should be friends, let it end, is it better
To forget or remember, your body's tender
The rhymes that I send her, makes her surrender
The feeling of capture, caught in a rapture
No woman can match ya, so when I'm lookin' at ya
Paint a perfect picture so you can remember me
But you can find the end if you pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, oh, oh

Friends are hard to find

Eric B. & Rakim,"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up convert it in a hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
Cause you'll get fried in the end if you pretend to be
Competing cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme wit yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stun
Remember me, the one you got your idea from
But soon you start to suffer but you only get rougher
When you start to stutter that's when you had enough of
Biting it, I make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should of broke cause I ain't no joke

I got a question, it's serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pack then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood chores
The e-m-c-e-e don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those 7 mc's
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat dj, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait til e say
Play 'em, so I'mma have to dis and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke

I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation cause when I invent
I nominated my dj the president
When I'm senile, people freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
They'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiendin'
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the r so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
Cause I'm moving the crowd and b a record fader
No interruptions and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And take you for a walk through hell
Feed your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple state darkness
When it get dark again then I'mma spark this
Microphone cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finish when the beat is gone, I'm no joke",I Ain't No Joke,1997
Eric B. & Rakim,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch with my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me",Eric B. Is President,1997
Eric B. & Rakim,"Verse one:

Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When i heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on 
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd

Imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger everytime I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric be	 is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,

",Busy Child [Radio Edit],1998
Eric B. & Rakim,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

Eric B. & Rakim,"Yo Rakim, what's up?
Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E., man I'm trying to get paid in full
Well, check this out, since Norby Walters is our agency, right?
True

Kara Lewis is our agent, word up
Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company, indeed
Okay, so who we rollin' with then? We rollin' with Rush
Of Rushtown Management

Check this out, since we talking over
This def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'?
And together, we can get paid in full

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint

So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just

Search for a nine to five, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this
Feelin' out of place 'cause, man, do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric be, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish

'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now to test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full

Rakim, check this out, yo
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad
'Cause it took us too long to do this album

Yo, I hear what you're saying
So let's just pump the music up
And count our money

Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
Turn down the bass down
And let the beat just keep on rockin'

Aiyyo.. what's goin on?
The Mic Lebanon Teflon Don..
I'm back baby
The year of the 9's
And I'ma have to make these motherfuckers a offer they can't refuse
y'know?

Ha, what's goin on?  Yo c'mon, you know it's on
I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn
Make sure the force is right, I floss all night
Get off the mic it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe
Keep em in the lie-bury, studyin my theory
Ra theory get translated in Swahili
From the lands as far as Zanzibar
They understand the are, the man Allah
It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this
Soon as my data processes Y2K they floppy disk
Now who the hottest is?  How can it not be this?
Baby who the cockiest?  Papi is?  Gracias
Aiyyo, this be so, magnifico
Even my, typical, style difficult
Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show
Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?

[Chorus]
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo any club that I come to
I hit a microphone check one two
And they know what I want to do - flow forever

[Rakim]
You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's cause y'all kiss the floor, say this my Lord
It's the chosen one, with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holdin one
In the front row sitty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra the Conqueror
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode?  I guess so
Those that halved out, wanted to have clout
What they mad about?  Must be a cash route
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this they spaz out

[Chorus x 2]

[Rakim]
Wherever Rakim go, it's the God temple
It's simple, my M.O., no problemo
Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at
I did the welcome mat, and then welcome back
My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-it-All
They want me to show em all my brand new protocol
Excuse-a-moi, I make a move for Ra
You ain't soupin Ra, save the hoop-a-la
Let me find out you rhymed out designed out
Pullin dimes out then climb out, for time out
I'm at the free throw, playin ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough
Reloaded like Carlito, incognito
I be so, low key, women get nosy
I do a show they want to go see to get to know me
In the front row seat they cosy
Thinkin I'm givin them the bo-bo-bee until they O.D.

The a roundest one left 
Who flows express to them rhythm drum set ain't done yet? 
Flow like a trumpet to your eardrum are deaf 
Who pose a threat?

Rhymes I write wins and kept a white Benz 
Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens 
I get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners 
When I flip it's the opposite of dark Bruce Banner 
Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear 
And just when it all seem clear I disappear

Reappear like vol-la the street scholar 
I'm 40 deep like Ali Baba 
Give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor 
Keep it hot like lava, yeah

I am the genie of the mic an 
I can do anything you wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance 
 
Ready to dance y'all, my magic carpet's the dance floor 
Last chance y'all even if you can't ball 
What part don't you understand? Your wish is my command 
And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand 
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby 
It gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy 
It's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps back 
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats 
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters 
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is 
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters 
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses 
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing 
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing 
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise 
'Cause the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy 
   
I know I you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic an 
I can do anything you wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance

I spread a war, like never before 
Spit lead at yours like a ghetto braud raw at a 
She'll never pause 
With raw metaphors, I set it off 
But I just begun the best is yet to come 
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young 
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns 
Test the one, let Allah protect your son 
Cause something musical magician, the ageiathic author 
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor 
You can explore, every sentence is a tour 
The inventor is more than adventure 
You'll be blown away, and a zone ? 
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say 
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze 
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray 
 
I know you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic and 
I can do anything wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance

I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas 
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of 
So I made some more to put the New World in Order 
with Mathematics, put your status above the average 
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics 
Cause new days is dawnin, new ways of peformin 
Brainstormin, I write and watch the night turn to mornin 
On and on and, I got the whole world respondin 
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warnin

The wait is over, in-formation like a soldier 
like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older 
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents 
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence 
I'm Asiatic, and blazin microphones a habit 
At least once durin the course of a day, it's automatic 
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharaoh 
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow 
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me 
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi 
More thoughts than Bibles, recital - taught disciples

Still leave authors and writers with arthritis 
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style 
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile 
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now 
Cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while 
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb

It's the god Rakim, the master 
Feel this 

(1st verse) 
This is that lost ass track off-the-rack kind of a track 
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that 
You know where I'm at, there go the gat 
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack 
Steamin' ___, speedin' navigatin' the map 
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap, ya hand on your gat 
Premeditated plan of attack, with two of your most deadliest mens in the back 
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot 
Get out like you own the spot, home or not 
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way 
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day 
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle 
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle 
Boom boom- this one is gettin' blazin' hot 
Boom boom- make you bust another shot from the Glock

From the streets below to everything above 
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood 
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug

From the streets beneath my feet to the sun

And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs

Here we come now 
Turntable spin like a merry-go-round 
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds 
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround 
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds 
This is the track that made Theodore wanna scratch 
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back 
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall 
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law 
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke 
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke 
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick 
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit 
This is the description of designs for you to listen to 
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular 
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee 
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40

Yeah kid, give up your riches 
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures 
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas 
Or witcha missus, gettin tropical kisses 
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits 
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it 
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset 
She want a rim shot all over her drum set 
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset 
""Damn, baby, you ain't come yet?"" 
Hell, no- doomstick big as a elbow 
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow 
And all you gotta do is play the track again

It takes me thirty minutes to eat'em, forty minutes to digest'em, 
And fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
So ask yourself a question?(What question?) 
Can the Canibus rhyme? 
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine? 
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you're running by, trip you up from behind

Standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
God dam eggplants, niggas getting' me vexed man 
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
And I can't seem to get away from it 
I dreamed that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it 
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that 
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin' 
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried 
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine 
When I aim and fire my rhymes, like a hundred cannon balls flying 
Striking you one at a time, in a parallel line 
While the art of emceeing is steady dying 
Canibus and Rakim Allah is still in there prime!

Eric B. & Rakim,"Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? who do I invade? 
Bullets of teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'ma get back to new york in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Sky lights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me...
President bush said attack
Flashback to nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up
From a war of dreams, heat up the m-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more bodybags
They can't identify em, leave the nametags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)

Day divides the night and night divides the day
It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? who's on the other side of the wall? 
Somebody give the president a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A desert storm: let's see who reigns supreme
Something like monopoly: a government scheme
Go to the army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? hell no, not me
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, saddam hussein prays the same
And this is asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant? 
Blame it on john hardy hawkins for bringing me to america
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)

The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt
Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin
Half of my platoon came home in coffins
Except the general, buried in the storm
In bits and pieces no need to look for em
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When they call, I'm going awol
Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember pearl harbor? new york could be over, g
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the east, they want revenge for saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? 
No time to wonder, somebody's going under
Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge
Take control, cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor

Beginning without the, end so play the
Eye inside, no extended version
Next episode be smooth as a persian
Rhyme everlastin, there'll be no part two
Knowledge is infinite, once I start to draw
A better picture for your third eye, if you're blind
You know with a mic, I'm a black michaelangelo
I'm the brother whose ideas are colorful
Givin em insight, but givin em trouble to
Comprehend cause they thoughts won't blend in
They're pretendin, while I'm extendin
You bite like a parasite, ? you attacks
But you won't strike, cause you ain't no match
You need more light cause yours got dim
Then you get sparked by the lord rakim
What's the matter g, check your battery
Go get charged up, then come battle me
You try hard and die hard, you ain't eveready
When they check the pulse, you'll be +dead+ as

Shop at sears for new ideas
Check your engine and ask your engineers
To equalize, try to disguise it
If that don't work yo, then midasize it
You need more power, better bring battlecat
But this ain't grayskull, and you ain't rippin jack
Don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley

We can go rhyme for rhyme til the mic stop the
Workin
Then i'ma leave you behind the iron curtain
And you'll remain backstage
Your book is over, I ripped your last page
Changed the endin, at least you went out rappin
Now i'ma tell em what happened
I filled the mic with explosives, and lit it up
It was too heavy to hold, he couldn't pick it up
Pass the mic, let him try to get paid
He hit the stage, it went off like a hand grenade
Now scrape him off the floor and off my list
I ain't a soloist, I'm an arsonist
Sprayed up, he said he was gonna do what? 
Played up, mc grand but pooh-butt
Stole his lady, and drove her crazy
You asked me why - cause her man tried to play me
I sent her back a nervous wreck
And tried to put her back in check
My speciality is masterin the female species
I specialize in her, until she sees
Where I come from, and why I came
I tame the train til she manifest my name
Fill her with life until she burst with energy
Then leave her restless, cause a lot of women be
Tryin to drain us, and leave us stripped dry
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly
I clipped your wings and bring you down to earth
And tell you what life is worth
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic
You wanna pip on, imperialist with
Food for thought, cause I'm the shelter
I'll be your clothes, keep you warm and help ya
Not to be hot to trot by a haunt
And why do y'all got to flaunt? 
(you gotta use what you got
To get what you want)
Cool, I heat you up like a black mink coat
Hug your neck like a fat gold rope
Words I speak and my dj's cuts will warm ya ears
Like mink earmuffs
So eric show em how fast your hand'sll go
So the people in the stands'll know
That you don't scratch your cuts in the grave

Float, evoke, my tempo jets

Keep em, energetic, so let it
Pound in your head til what I said is embedded

Anywhere you want your poetry's pathetic
You gets.. no.. credit.. til you get it straight
Let's motivate
No intermissions cause it ain't commercial
If you wanna break then I'll reimburse you
I won't let go so my mic won't drop, cause

Paragraphs of potential to prevent you
From using my instrumental, keep in mind I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately

Then soon you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doing it wit the r...

Somethings's happening then I'm indulging
Music is mine, gucci seats reclined,
Gold grill, a paint job will shine..
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond

What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on
And what's going wrong? the good old days are gone
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
You invented a scam even you don't understand
You rig the enigma, can't figure it out
You change the route, now you're in doubt
You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed,
Figured you was all that but that ain't last;
The times is harder, the drugs is heavier
You say whatever, the more, the merrier;
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes,
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes;
No more good times, no more time,
Too far to find, you're almost blind,
You can't see what spot that the trap is in...
(hey bra!)what's happening!
You had it mapped out, your plans get torn,
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond
(hey bro) what's going on? 

What's going on? 

My neighborhood don't look so good
I'll find a way out.. yeah, I would if I could,
But the government is doing a project...
So I live in the projects;
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom,
Try to live long but you die too soon,
I might not be alive to see 25,
Taught at ten to make money and strive;
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends,
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit,
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit;
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test,
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress!
And then shake hands like a man,
'cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand!
But you had a one on one fight wit drugs,
When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs,
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone...
(hey bra!) what's going on? 

Yo, what's going on? 

The crime rate in new york state elevate,
A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate,
Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt,
Kids on the playground shot down and kilt!
Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more...
'cause stray bullets explore!
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely,
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out!
Half of the projects is dead or locked up,
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up.
Human abortion create distortions...
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born....!

Eric B. & Rakim,"Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano

Bring a bullet proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
Now what the trigger say

Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through

Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady
Say don't lose me

So reload quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin'
This fifi get wit' me

You steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me

Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But watch the God get

Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast

Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't thirty-eight
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate

Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' 'em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma

Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I

Reduced the friction
With crucifixion
Let loose the mix
Then boost the piston

Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that

I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm
Hit another M.C.

Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when

Music is louder
Full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of

Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss

But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines
That I have to hit

Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up

You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate
And nothing's equivalent

Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around
To rob with a army

You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em,
Soon as I inject 'em

With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in

Let it split 'em
Since he brought his main man wit' 'em
He ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass

Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance

The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here
Let me introduce you

Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy

Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a havoc

If ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention, follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose

Too many milligram
But what made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man

Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'em, he'll never forget 'em
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em

At least when he left he'll know what hit 'em
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, catch up, hell no

Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it

Perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'

Blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein, then remain, let it radiate

Vibes will vibrate, why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style break
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone

Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach your intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my write reflect

Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er

As we traveled sorrow bound
And offered up her wings for using

To find the place where they belong

Are blowing 'round and the sky is gray

And drag a net to seine the bottom for the purse the bastards bring

And then you will see that the circle begins here with
Mother, daughter, sister, lover
Father, and son, brother, lover

One day soon you'll be one or the other
And you'll see that the circle begins here with... me

We can grow together
We can walk together
We can laugh
We can cry together
Mother, daughter
Sister, lover
Father, and son
Brother, lover
One day soon
I'll discover
What will be

Eric Bazillian,"You shake me free of my dreams
From this bed I hit the floor
What day is it anyway?
Go away, and close the door

I want to cry in silence
You want to talk some sense
I've just stopped trying
It feels like I'm dying

Please don't shout
It's only anger that you're waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see I'm not listening?

Today I cry for my sins
Tomorrow call me a fool
The pressure drives me deeper
It's like there's nothing left to lose

Oh, anger is my best friend
Why don't you pull up an easy chair?
You can't save anyone else
You can't save me from myself

[Chorus x 2]

I'm not listening
I'm not listening
Stop your shouting
I'm not listening

If only I could release
Instead of talking to myself
Every feeling that I have
Would you bury all my doubts?

But you can't walk in my shoes
Every mile just feels like two
I won't keep explaining
I won't keep on trying
So what if I'm hiding
You're giving me a headache

[Chorus x 2]

Please don't shout
Oh no
I stopped listening
I'm not listening
No, I'm not listening
Can't you hear me?
I'm not listening",Please Don't Shout,1997
Eric Bazillian,"Without a moment's hesitation
They threw caution to the wind
He thought she must be blind not to see
He was no Prince Charming, no beauty
She held flowers at her fingertips
And honey fell from her lips
He dived into the oceans wild
As she swam in the morning mist
He said, ""If it's mine it will be always yours.""
Cast away any doubt, and open up those doors 
It was the shark and the mermaid
As they grown in mind and body
And the days turned into years
He thought one day she might go away
But her love overshadowed his fears
Under the liquid sky where they lived 
They were legends to behold
Fate distracted by their simple charm
Left them there to love alone
Now the angels wait patiently
For the shadows down below
They stop and smile because
It's the shark and the mermaid
Nobody thought that the love would last
Everybody looked, and everybody laughed
But the mermaid and the shark
They just slipped away
Nothing stopped them
No one got in their way
Standing together as lovers and friends
They stayed together 
Their love knew no end
Proving everyone wrong
They grew together
There were strong
Everybody was wrong

Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too

Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel

'Cause our love is fading
Can I get the message through to you
I'm someone to love

What if we had equality for all men
What if we forgot all our forefather sins
What if you forgot the color of my skin
What if you could wear the skin I'm in

What if we knew that we could disagree
But still make love the first priority
Show me love like you're suppose to do

[Chorus]
People can you see
'Cause our love is fading
Can I get a message through to you
Can we keep this thing cool
A lot of love we're needing
I'm ready and I'm willing
Don't you know that I s'til think of you
As someone to love

Eric Benét ,"Through this veil of tears
I can see what was suppose to be
Now it's all so clear
Love from you was so real, so true, genuine
Stronger than time

[Chorus:]
Wipe your tears away
Kiss you every morning
Hear every word you had to say
Are all the things I should have done
While you were here
And now the foolish boy has grown
Into this man I'm sorry you've never known
I'm not afraid to love
'Cause every beat of my heart
Echoes all those memories from way back when
And the man I should have been

[Chorus:]

Faded dreams of you and me
And of our little family
Gone forever
My god in heaven
Before the gift of clarity
We pay the price of misery
Why please tell me why

Her mommy's gone away
But in her eyes I see you more each day
How can I repay
All your love unreturned
From so long, long ago
Now I know

Alternate chorus
I'll wipe her tears away
Kiss her every morning
Hear every word she has to say
Do all the things that you
Would do if you were here
Brighten her rainy day
Catch her when she's fallen
Say I love you each and every day
Do all the things that you
Would do if you were here

Eric Benét ,"Everybody wants to rise above
Without a touch of dignity
Without a stroke of love

Take a little time and check yourself
To live the life you're praying for

If you got a dime to lend
You never really matter in the end to them
That's why

I'm true to myself ya'll
I'm true to my family
And love with a true integrity
I'm true to myself ya'll
True to my God above
And love with a true integrity

Everybody wants a piece of you and me
To be the victim of their greed
Or co-dependency

It's so very hard to know
Which way to go
A lie can be the gospel truth
If eloquently told

Everybody wants to make amends
If they can see another win
You never really matter in the end to them
That's why

[Chorus]

Some people live their whole life
And they'll never see
The only way to find true happiness
Is to thine own self be

True to yourself why'all
Got to live your life for you, yeah
All you gotta do, well
Is be true to yourself, well
I'm true to myself, why'all

I got to be true, oh yeah

So many nights lying by your side
Sleeping with secrets deep inside
Secrets your eyes could not deny

Beautiful lies once more tell me
With all the love in my heart

And though it all seems so unfair
No one's to blame when love's not there

Feels like I'll surely go insane

Just hold me until the morning comes

is much more than just letting go

But they ain't got shit to say
It's like I've come this far just to miss simpler days
I need to feel her tonight

I've seen a million girls

A ghetto girlI like her 'cause she keeps it real
A ghetto girlshe lets me know just how she feels

She won't never leave me guessing
Always let me know the deal
You know that ghetto love is always on the real
She got inner city struggles
And her blood runs deep in me

Take a chance, spin the wheel
Till I find something real
A love of my own

Flash back to the memory,
because the picture's so clear
The love high is so divine, there's nothing better
Heaven is so far away, but she'll bring it right here
And I believe that she can see my
face in her fantasy

No one here beside me she had to go
So I'll start my search again

But from that day and there on, in her arms is where I'll be

It's like someone just burned my castle
Paint the picture like Picasso
But the image fades
Now for some it might sound deep
But I just received a beep
So I called back anxiously

Why I ain't calling you back

Like she took the words from
Every dream I've known, every love outgrown
Singing on and on, like she took the words from my heart

And to the poetry girl down the hall
Late at night I would answer her calling
Like the lyrics from one of her songs
She made love to me

Now our bodies and souls intertwined
On the wings of passion we were soaring
Then by the flickering candle at night
She would sing to me

[Chorus:]

Love is often unkind when we fall
For now my poetess sings to another
But when I think of those nights down the hall
From somewhere deep inside

I sing songs of change, joy and pain
All the love I've made, I take the words from
Every dream I've known, every love outgrown
Singing on and on, and I take the words from my heart

[Chorus:]",Poetry Girl,1999

Like a circle peg in a square hole
I tried to push it but it wouldn't go
It didn't kill me so my strength increased
And now I finally see

I found a love that was gone deep inside of me
I found a man who was lost and I set him free
I thought that the pain was never gonna end
But now I can be myself again

I had the best the world could offer for sho'
But peace of mind is much more precious than gold
I was in place where truth was hard to find
But it's all revealed in time

Forgot how it felt to feel so good inside
A fool would gain the world just to lose himself
Now I'm gonna be true to no one else

I gotta light in my eyes for the world to see
Thank God the music's back inside of me
It was a long hard road to be a better man

I hold my head up high everywhere that I go

Time that can heal what's been on your mind

The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide, gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want, but nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities, losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need to find that road
Right around that curve, a lesson learned...
Now that I have the eyes to see

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain

It's sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

With poise and toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view

Spiraling down but so oblivious, got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane....a hurricane
It's sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

And sometimes I'd try to break those walls and feel your love
But I came alive inside when I finally found my way

How could people go from a feeling that words can't describe
To a place of not even caring if I'm even alive

The love that we shared, did it fade into nothing
Where does the love go
After all the dreams that we had did it vanish completely
Where does the love go
Where does the love go

They say that love is a timeless energy, it never dies it just changes form
But it when it changed from the shape of you and me it took the shape of a raging storm
I'm not asking for second chances
I just want you to see
Until you take a look at yourself girl
You could never be free

The love that we shared, did it fade into nothing
Where does the love go
After all the dreams that we had did it vanish completely
Where does the love go?
The love that we shared, did it fade into nothing
Where does the love go
After all the dreams that we had did it vanish completely
Where does love go?

When it dissipates does it turn to hate
If you see me on the street, would you talk to me
For the sake of love, ain't worth it babe?
How could people go from a feeling that words can't describe
To a place of not even caring if I'm even alive

The love that we shared, did it fade into nothing
Where does the love go
After all the dreams that we had did it vanish completely
Where does the love go
The love that we shared, does it fade into nothing
Where does the love go
After all the dreams that we had does it vanish completely
Where does love go
The love that we shared
Where does the love go

Clapped in church on Sunday morning

Played a tambourine so well

She'd say, ""Billy don't you run so fast 
Might fall on a piece of glass 
""Might be snakes there in that grass""

Used to lift her face and tell her,

That you really love that man 
Put yourself in Jesus hands""

Used to hand me piece of candy

Picked me up each time I fell

Boy, they really came in handy

What you want to spank him for?

There ain't no resting for the weary

I need something to feel
So my spirit can heal

I need you to wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, you'll make everything alright
When you wrap them chocolate legs around me
The memory of my day will quickly just fade away
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me

Your cocoa skin against mine, babe
Is all I need to help revive me
Just touch me and I feel pure, pure love
You're the only thing I'm ever sure of(your love I'm sure of)
I need some reminding
That God is still, He's still behind me
Baby, come take my soul and set me free

Eric Benét ,"[Verse 1]
Now the heat of love feels like it's starting to cool
I hear the bells, but they don't ring the way they used to
It's like breaking up is our next obvious move
But let's not move too soon, oh, no

See, the problem going 'round too often these days
People throwing in the towel once they pass the honeymoon phase
A stronger love awaits if we endure this pain
Or else we've been these years, cried these tears in vain (I'm saying)

[Chorus]
Don't let go (That's all I'm saying)
Don't let go (Ooh, girl let's stop playing)
Don't let go (Think of all the love we've been making)
Don't let go (Don't let it go)

[Verse 2]
I've worked your patience, girl and you've been working my nerves
We scream at each other, but we're not hearing one word
We've made mistakes that neither one of us deserves
Leaving much desired where I was concerned

I saw an old man and his wife early today
They were holding hands, his eyes locked in her gaze
Think of all the times they came so close to parting ways
In my mind, I could hear him say, ""Stay, babe.""

Don't let go (I could hear him say)
Don't let go (Don't throw the love away)
Don't let go (Aren't we worth it, baby?)
Don't let go (Don't let it go)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
With some other girl, I could move on
Trading old problems just for new
To some other guy, you could belong
Going through changes we've been through

When another brother is trying to make a play
Don't you let go
When another woman jumps in my face
I will not let go
When the honeymoon starts fading away
I won't let go
If we're gonna make it I want to hear you say
I swear I won't let go.

[Chorus]",Don't Let Go,2008
Eric Benét ,"[Verse 1]
I never thought it was possible.
In my reality
I thought my chances for love were gone.
That time ran out for me.

My heart has been through some changes.
And heaven knows
What I thought was my everlove was so conditional

But my love, everyday with you I'm so surprised
Morning comes, I fall in love again
Each night, I'm thanking God you're in my life
I don't know how I know, but this feeling won't be ending

[Chorus]
You're my everlove
Oh, my everlove
Everlasting through all changes in our lives

You're my everlove
You're my everlove
Ever growing everyday and every night
I found my everlove

[Verse 2]
I'll never ask for perfection
That's how a love can slip away
I only ask for the truth in your heart
The rest we'll work out day by day

You've seen the best and worst of me
But you're still standing here, oh
There is nothing that can stop us now
Cause we've got nothing left to fear

The future will show the power of a moment just like this
Whatever love can dream we both will know
Whatever we imagine will exist
Every kiss, I swear my life, will be deserving of your

Eric Benét ,"Still wanting me, still hungry

Now the first kiss was the one that left me seeing
Just how deep your into me.
Surprised by your intensity, I couldn't believe.

Now the next kiss happened 7 days ago
That's when I started letting go
Dropped my guard and let you know
I was ready for more.

Oh, that's when I took you home
And I wasn't quite ready for how you came
Words can't explain
The pleasures we've explored.

Oh, we've been making love 6 nights strong
And I can't believe just how long you can go
I'm ready for more of the hunger in your soul

[Chorus]
Girl you're blazing like you never get enough of me
Its amazing and I'm loving that you're
Still wanting me, you're still hungry
You keep rising like you're never gonna reach the top
I'm not tryin' to make you stop
Because you're still wanting me, still hungry

Now the first time was amazing like I said.
Like nothing I've seen, done or read
Colors and music played in my head
I wasn't prepared

Now the next time happen when I finally caught my breath
I saw the sweat drip off your chest.
Girl you inspire my very best
And I gave nothing less

And it seems
With every conversation in between
I get a little more attracted
When you open up your mind girl I find
Your perception of the world coincides with mine.

And I tried to let the fever in me subside
But every time I see that little look in your eye
I come back to life
And I rise, I rise, I rise, oh

From the bedroom to the kitchen, up against the wall
Still I hear your body call because
You're still wanting me, and you're still hungry

From 100 miles an hour back to slow motion
I'm the waves up on your ocean
Cause your still wanting me, and you're still hungry

Did you know that you smile when you're asleep?
Is it there all the time
Or only when you're with me?
When the morning sun shines on your face
Let me be the first breath you take.

My buddy, Greg lost his leg serving time in the desert
Sitting drinking, thinking of things he couldn't do no more
Took a while for Greg to smile, but I heard he's doing better
He just won a marathon, second year in a row

Oh, there's a storm that you're gone have to ride in your life
Hope is the beacon that saves when you're lost in your life
Just hold on and you'll go with the tide

And it won't take long, till it's gonna be alright

[Verse 2:]
I knew a girl, a pretty girl, but her daddy never loved her
She wondered why every guy left her out in the cold
What Daddy did she must forgive, before her heart grows colder
And all the love she's dreaming of, maybe then she will know
Yeah, we've got stories and people to blame for our lives
No, don't get lost in that circle
Don't you know that's a lie, the only way is to leave the past behind

There's so much more inside you and me
That the world needs to still believe
Nothing's too great for this God and me

Grab a gun, everyone, said the leader of many

The angels threw me high above
They called it Heaven, but I know it was a lie
For when I looked, you weren't inside

If I had only one more tomorrow
I'd spend that day with you
I'd feel no more pain or sorrow there with you

Can I find the words that could explain?
How my heart, my life, my soul, you changed forever

You ease my pain with such gentle hand
And when I'm with you I'm a better man
And I'll never ever understand the way

'Cause you sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
And when I look into your eyes I hear a song that never dies
'Cause you sing to me

There's so much evil in the world today
Everybody's trying to make their way
Looking for a piece of love to make it better

But we can make it through and rise above
With your letter serenade of love
And I know that we'll be strong enough to go on and on and on

'Cause you sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
Sweet enough to make me cry 'cause it keeps our love alive
Oh you sing to me, oh won't you sing baby?

And even through the fire
I know our love will find a way
And you're the reason why girl
I'm singing stronger everyday

You sing to me without music or words

Like when you said our first kiss, will surely be our last.

Eric Benét ,"There's a knock outside my door
It's you again!
There's a kiss that let's me know,
This love won't end.
There's a life, there's a touch and a smile
And we're making love,
And all is perfect in my lonely world again.
As we lay we make a plan for life together,
Holding on with all the might full worst or better,
I can't believe,
I can't conceive all the time that you're not with me,
But in a flash I'm in this lonely room again.

[Chorus]
I don't wanna stay here lost in time,
I don't understand this heart of mine,
I keep letting go to fantasy,
Never letting go of you and me.
I don't wanna stay here lost without you!

There's a house upon the hill I hear the laughter,
And our children seem to grow each year much faster,
We're alone now in this emptiness and love still grows,
But only visions of a life that should have been.

[Chorus]

You are, the only one I'm holding down for always,
My heart, in the time of light, shinning bright in your
So far,
I can't let go, I won't let go,
And that's why,
I will face reality till it brings you back to me.

[Chorus: x3]",Lost in Time,2010
Eric Benét ,"I'm known to have a heart that love couldn't find
I used to come and go no thought of what I left behind
But now somehow I've grown to see the world through brand new eyes
A better world that you've shown to me
When you were gone
Felt like the stars were pointless to shine
And my days dragged on
Without a cause or reason to find babe
I'm on my own
I'm just a lonely waste of time
That should be spent with you faithfully

[Chorus]
So I never wanna live without you
Never gonna live without you
I never wanna live without you
Never wanna live
Cause you're the biggest part of my life
All of my world is built around you

Never make it through without you
All the love you bring to me

I was blind
Such a fool but now I see darling
Just hold my hand
Wherever we are just hold me
And now the second chance to start a life and family
I thank the Lord and you for this gift to me

So I never wanna live without you baby (I'll never live without you babe)
Never gonna live to doubt you (never live to doubt your love)
No I never wanna live without you baby (oh no)
Never wanna live without the biggest part of my life
Wanna build my world around you baby (wanna build my world)
Never make it through without you
All the love you bring to me

Thank you for the love
When you knew I was wrong
Thank you for the chance
To run back to your arms
Where I belong
I don't need to see
Who is there on the other side
Cause you are my love
My life
Until the day I die

I'm slavin' on to the bone to survive

How that's gonna be

Sun was shinin, you were in a hurry but nowhere that ya had to be

Thats when my summer came alive but seasons come and seasons go (ooohh)
Tender kisses underneath the moonlight softly on your brown skin

And like the temperature outside our feelings and emotions rose
I dreamed id take you as my bride but soon the autumn winds would blow (ooowoo)

Hey, I hope I hope I hope it's you

A long time I've been alone
The one love I had was thrown away
And that was a shame
I come home and there's no phone calls
The sunset is just the light gone off
With love I'm just lost
But then I saw your face and felt my odds improve
And so I had to brave your filthy magic too

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again
If wishes come true (if wishes come true)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)
And if I ever ever ever get a chance to hold your hand (take your hand)
I'll be sayin' I do (I'll be sayin' I do)
As long as it's you (I hope that it's you)
I hope that it's

I gave up 'cause I've been through it
But you smiled girl and I heard music playing
I ain't been the same (I never been the same)
A long while but I learned some lessons
So this time you'll get the best in me (you're gonna get the best in me)
If this is supposed to be
They say the first time is the deepest love by far
But girl it's looking like the second time's the charm

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again (if I ever feel that light)
If wishes come true (if wishes come true)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)

I hope that it's

You got me thinkin' 'bout the future and you know that's not like me
No matter where we go, you make me feel it's where I'm s'posed to be
If I only had a nickel every time I said I'm through
But all the money in the world don't mean a thing if I can't have you

So if I ever ever ever feel the light of love again (if I ever feel that love light)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)
Please let it be you (please let it be you)
And if I ever ever ever get a chance to take your hand (one chance to take your hand)
Oh I'm sayin' I do (sayin' I do)
I hope that it's you (I hope that it's you)

You got me hopin', girl you got me hopin'
Let's take a chance love, tell me what you think you're gonna do
I hope that it's you (I hope it's you)
Girl here it is so let's make it official (come on)
I need to know now, tell me if you feel like I do
I hope that it's you

Everybody has a load that they must carry
To go it alone is so unnecessary
Don't let your pride deny this love ain't good for sharing

Eric Bogle,"""NOW I'M EASY""
- Eric Bogle

For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

I married a fine girl when I was twenty
But she died in giving birth when she was thirty
No flying doctor then, just a gentle old black 'gin
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

She left me with two sons and a daughter
On a bone-dry farm whose soil cried out for water
So my care was rough and ready, but they grew up fine and steady
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

My daughter married young, and went her own way
My sons lie buried by the Burma Railway
So on this land I've made me home, I've carried on alone
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

City folks these days despise the Cockie
Say with subsidies and dole, we've had it easy
But there's no drought or starving stock on a sewered suburban block
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy

For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud, have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
And now I'm easy

Eric Bogle,"""SOMETHING OF VALUE""
-Eric Bogle

I can see the Southern Cross tonight
While here below, bathed in it's light
The Dreamtime land safe, snug and tight is sleeping
Wrapped in complacency and contentedness
No discordant sounds disturb our rest
While the gentle souls we've dispossesed are weeping

We took it all by the gun and the sword
By the right of our race and in the name of our God
Though as outcasts ourselves, transported, condemned
None knew better than we the injustice of men

We took it all in our hunger and need
Enslaved by our past and consumed by our greed
And left them to beg for the scraps at our door
While we called them drunkards and wasters and whores
They've been drowning, drowning in their tears
For the last two hundread years

From England's New Jerusalem
To the Dreamtime land the tall ships came
With human cattle in convict chains to bind them
In the grim fight just to stay alive
Dreams must struggle to survive
Few could see the glitt'ring prize before them

We had it all in the palm of our hand
A new hope, a new dream, a new life, a new land
One last chance to break from the chains of the past
To build something of value, build something to last

This ancient land was a vast empty page
Waiting for the great writers of a brand new age
The future was ours to protect or profane
A paradise lost, a paradise gained
Now tell me, is paradise here,
After two hundred years?

So now, beneath the Southern Cross
It's time to tally up the cost
Of what we've gained and what we've lost forever
Though much has gone we can't replace
Those of us who love this place
Together now, must turn and face the future

So here's to us all, we're frail humankind
Who wander through life mostly helpless and blind
To our courage and cowardice, our humor and pain
Our hundred steps forward, ninety-nine back again

Yes here's to us all, the wise and the fools
The indifferent, the caring, the kind and the cruel
As we march to the beat of an uncertain drum
Stumbling towards what we may yet become
Towards the brave new frontiers,
Of the next two hundred years

Children are born with trust in their eyes
It's the first thing that we betray
Children are born believing in magic
It's the first thing we take away
Fill them with doubt instead of magic
And fear instead of trust
And after awhile, they're just like us

On this earth there is a city
In a rich green pleasant country
Where they kill their children
The children of the streets
Free enterprise extermination
Why waste rehabilitation?
A bullet is forever
It's so final quick and cheap

And the despots all wear policemen's badges
Kill to supplement their wages
Earn their bloody bounty
With the gun and the club and knife
While profit-conscious businessmen
Upright solid citizens
Pay them a cew cruzeiros
For every murdered street kids life

(But they're children!)
They're garbage on the streets
(Oh the children!)
They're beggars, whores and thieves
(Oh pity the children!)
Cry pity if you will,
There's none on the streets
Of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil

To bless this piece of paradise
High on a hill stands Jesus Christ
Gazing down with sightless eyes
At the daily blasphemy
A mocking marble coontradiction
Arms spread wide in benediction
Suffer the little children,
Suffer them to come to me

And the despots cry ""amen, amen""
While they bow their knees to Bethlehem
They spit in the face of humankind
Turn our dreams to worthless dust
And the future, as it's always done,
Stares down the barrel of a gun
Which once more begs the question,
When will the despots come for us?

(But they're children!)
Have you seen their eyes?
(Oh the children!)
Hard and wary and street-wise
(Oh pity the children!)
There are no children here
Only old eyes full of hunger
And hate and hopeless fear

(But they're children!)
Abandoned and forsaken
(Oh the children!)
Useless human flotsam
(Oh pity the children!)
And pity us as well
For in our children's' eyes
We see mirrors of ourselves

",Mirrors,1993
Eric Bogle,"No use pretending things can still be right
There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss tonight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

At first we thought that love was here to stay
The summer made it seem so right
But like the sun we watched it fade away

He's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
There's plastic shamrocks everywhere, there's Guinness and green beer
And a sign in gaelic above the bar which says ""God Bless All Here""

His guitar sounds like a wardrobe, and it's out of tune at that
His singin' voice it ranges from a sharp to a flat
He's just desecrated ""The Holy Ground"", ripped apart ""Black Velvet Band""
Sang some nights drunk and now he's sunk ""The Irish Rover"" with all hands

'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
The publican's a proddy Scot by the name of McIntyre
Who does not allow collections for the men behind the wire

He's done awful things to ""Molly Malone"" and ""The Farrows of Tralee""
He's murdered ""Carach Fergus"" and poor old ""Mother Machree""
He's just thrashed his way through ""Galway Bay"" and ""The Wild Irish Rose""
And if he starts singing ""Danny Boy"", I'm gonna punch him in the nose!

He's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
There's Aer Lingus posters everywhere showing pretty Irish scenes
All peaceful and idyllic, and very bloody green!

""When Irish Eyes are Smiling"" and ""The Mountains of Mourne""
In a central Celtic chiché, the man has left no stone unturned
'Til he embarks upon the harp that once through terraced halls
Accompanying himself on the Bodhrán, which takes a lot of courage

'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
Now he's just sung in his mother tongue, ""The Ancient Irish Curse""
And cleared the pub completely by the forty-second verse!

'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
He's started singin' ""Danny Boy"", so it's time that I was gone
And just one thought comes to my mind, as I stagger through the door
Where are you when we need you, Christy Moore?
Where are you when we need you, Christy Moore?

Eric Bogle,"""Welcome Home""
-Eric Bogle

Now when the boys came home, Annie cried and Annie cheered
She'd been on her own for a long and lonely year
Living for his letters from far away Vietnam
And dreading the official telegram

So she was waiting at the station when his train came rolling in
She ached with anticipation of holding him again
And suddenly he was standing there in his crumpled uniform
In a heartbeat she was in his arms

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
Did you wonder, over there,
When you were tired, when you were scared,
If your country really cared, welcome home

When a nation goes to war, everyone's a casualty
Some are maimed and scarred, most have wounds you cannot see
So in place of the man that she had known,
Annie found instead, a sick and troubled stranger in her bed

But she was stubborn, she was lovin', so she stayed all through the years
The hard times and the drinking, the nightmares and the tears
For where hate is muddy quicksand, love is tempered steel
Annie waited for his wounds to heal

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
We're just so glad that you're alive
And only you will wonder why
You lived when others died, welcome home

So on a sunny Sydney morning, I heard old war drums beat
And watched the boys come marching, down the city street*
To claim their place in the nation's heart
That their blood and pain had earned
A nation that rejoiced in their return

And if the day helped to heal some wounds is a matter of debate
For some it had come none too soon, for others far too late
But I found myself hoping, as the boys went marching past
That for them the war was over, at last

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
What you went through in Vietnam, we can't begin to understand
But to each and every man, welcome home

Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
May the years bring you release, as the memories decrease
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home

Eric Bogle,"Now I'm drowning in the sunshine as it falls down from the sky
There's something stirring in my heart, bright colours fill my eyes
It's from here to the far horizon your beauty does unfold
And oh, you look so lovely, dressed in green and gold

I can almost touch the ocean, shimmering in the distant haze
As I stand here on this mountain on this loveliest of days
Around half the world I've drifted, left no wild oats unsown
But now my view has shifted and I think I've just come home

To the homeless and the hungry, may we always open doors
May the restless and the weary find safe harbour on our shores
May you always be our dreamtime place, a spirit's glad release
May you always be our shelter, may we always live in peace

Now I'm drowning in the sunshine as it falls down from the sky

Eric Bogle,"I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Dan
And I'm an honest working man
A tarnished badge, they tell me
But it's one I wear with pride
A fair day's work for a fair day's pay
I've always lived my life that way
But now I can't help thinking
I've been taken for a ride

Those hard years on the factory floor
Toilin' in the ceaseless roar
That made me old before my time
Wrecked my hearing and my health
And when I total up the cost
What I've gained to what I've lost
I ask myself now Dan
What's the total of your wealth?
Just how much is your life worth?

I live in a house I'll never own
Could never get a housing loan
Bank managers and suchlike
Don't rate the likes of me
Feeding three kids on a fitter's wage
I've always found it hard to save
And being an honest working man
Don't count as equity

All those years of toil and sweat
Climbing in and out of debt
I often look back on them
And ask myself for what?
A rented house on a grimy street
An endless fight to make ends meet
When you add it all together
It don't seem like a lot
But it's all that I've got

But a man's life can't be judged alone
By what he has or what he owns
It's what he loves and cares for
That gives it quality
And what gives meaning to my life
Are my three kids and my wife
We've always stuck together
Always being a famil

Now my kids are rotting on the dole
Holding out the beggar's bowl
I see the anger in their eyes
It cuts me to the heart
And shall I simply stand aside
While my kids are slowly crucified?
Watch all I've worked and cared for
As it slowly falls apart
Well by Christ, I won't do that

I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Dan
And I'm an honest working man
A tarnished badge, they tell me
But it's one I wear with pride
A fair day's work for a fair day's pay
I've always lived my life that way
But now I can't help thinking
I've been taken for a ride

And though I ain't got much to spare
What I have I'm going to share
To give my kids and other kids
Some purpose, pride, and place
And you leeches, grown fat on my sweat
I promise you I won't forget
When I asked you if you'd share the load
You laughed right in my face
Yes, you laughed right in my face

I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Dan
And I'm an honest working man",Dan,1996

(Album: The Colour of Dreams)

Hey Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better

So Ibrahim, can you tell me, why did you come here?
What dream were you chasing and what did you hope to find here?
Did you flee from your own native land because your life was in danger?
Or were the reasons much more mundane, just poverty and hunger?

Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour

You see Ibrahim, there's something I've been meaning to tell you
Being hungry and poor bestows no special status upon you
We won't send you back, if you can prove they'd imprison or kill you
But if you're just going back home to starve, I'm afraid we can't help you

You see Ibrahim, you've become a bit of a problem
This world's full of refugees fleeing poverty, war and oppression
So to take in queue-jumpers like you, well it's out of the question
It would give the world's hungry and poor the wrong impression

Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour

I'm afraid Ibrahim, it's time to be totally candid
You had Buckley's chance* right from the moment you landed
Already to many a threat and a danger you were branded
And all because you follow the prophet Mohammed

You didn't count Ibrahim, on political opportunism
Our leaders knew that to many Australians, the very word ""Muslim""
Meant Al-Quaeda, Hammas, the Taliban, and terrorism
And that's why you and your family are locked up in prison.

Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour

So Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better
Yes I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better

""Buckley's Chance"" - Australian colloquialism meaning ""no chance whatsoever"".
The phrase came into use in the 1890's, although it's origins are now uncertain.

They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I aint takin no shorts, like a newport, 
Explortin' the fully joint and 
Explodin' on the whole court. 
And I don't wanna be,wanna be, nothin' like mike 
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin 
And when you in the spotlight,you get um jocked right 
But your life's not tight. 
Buckin' anybody forbed mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

I keep my mind on my money,money on my mind 
Finga' on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine 
Smokin' blunts a skunk, makin' hoes of punks 
And only underground funk bumpin' outta my trunk 
Live my life as a hustla, high till I die 
Meetin' bitches, gettin' riches, miss me when lie 
Picture me living out my life as a busta 
I ratha' pop out a shot out my glock, and blast muthafuckas 
I live that thug life baby I'm hopeless, chokin' off indo 
Tryin' to keep my focus 
Don't let that bullshit worry me,
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 
Till they bury me 
God gave me game so I'm hustlin', 
Pour out some liquor for my niggas 
2pac is still strugglin' 
My niggga breed new the time, 
Whether its rhyme or crime,
Nigga, I gotta get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

?
Now let me rushing threw your mind,
I'm balla is what I keep gettin' 
Every time I pick up the mic and start spittin' 
The sidewalk of new york will start bumpin' 
Jumpin' around,with the muthafuckin pound 
And I'm down to the fullest,and breakin' niggas ass off proper 
Did you right, that's right, cause I got you in my pocket again 
The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when 
I boasted,and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again. 
Like precision, cut the two lines in the division. 
Plus,what I add loose as flutes. its gaming foe sale like prostitutes. 
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt. 
They want me in the back,but bitch I'm in the front. 
Don't front,and really I don't need a reply. 
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye. 
I'm on a whole 'nother level,them hoes is left 
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself 
Goodbye,some many niggas lied to have 
Funny what a muthafucka' do for math 
I got rats caught up in my everyday actions,point 
Equal to your realist satisfaction 
Buckin' anybody that forbid mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to got mine

The bell tolls 
The black plague has struck
Diseased eyes roll upwards
As if knowing which direction their souls will travel
(bring out your dead)

A woman in black cries
As the deathly procession passes by
And monks moan en masse

[Gregorian chants]

The yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door
For it is safer inside the walls
Their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard
The bodies of unfortunates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls
And ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches.
(bring out your dead)

And the bell tolls on
A man walks around the castle walls on the outside
The light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves
He tends the sick
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
But he feels it most for the children
(unclean)

Tears glisten on his cheek
Did man ever deserve this death?
And not all will die, just the poor 
For the rich are inside the castle walls
And he knows he could be with them
And they laugh at this fool of a man 
Through the stone fortress windows
And the bell tolls on
(unclean)

And many deaths and many days later
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain 
For tears can never erase the pain of death
Only time has that talent
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
(bring out your dead)

The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
Life for the people flowers again
They breathe fresh air like they did once before
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
The bell has stopped

And only silence is heard
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within
In their bones they feel something is wrong
The bell has been silent much too long
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
No one came and no one went
Fear can do many strange things

And even though water ran low
Their mouths burnt and belly's caked dry
Not one person put a foot outside
No one had that much courage
For they feared the peasants and their world outside
So they played it safe and didn't move
But one by one they perished and died",The Black Plague,1967

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

As a child I dreamed of her, on the far banks of the river
I knew she could not be reached, for my mind was forever wondering
Far above his head, as he tried his best to teach me
The river was muddy and black, black as the coal she carried
Impossible to cross, many men had tried
The old sailor told me, another life is lost

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Black was the colour of my childish dreams, impressions that would last
Black coal, coal black pit yacka's face, escaping the coal dust blast
Blind pony stumblin' to the light of day, to retire in the green fields forever
And I'll build me a bridge of steel, to beat the black river forever
I'll beat that black river forever, I'll beat that muddy river forever

And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I

That's the sound of little feet
Running away from home
Little feet are always running away from home
To find bigger feet

There were lots of places I had not been
I had a dream in my head about a little Japanese girl
And it wasn't till I sailed halfway 'round the world

I miss good lookin' women in my home town
You know I miss warm cookin' mama, that you lay down

I found myself
On the 'frisco Bay
Getting high off the wind
A different chick every day
It wasn't till I found
Myself down Mexico way
With tears in my eyes
I was hurt to ?
You know, Lord I said...
I miss good lookin' women in my home town
You know I miss the home cookin' mama, that you lay down

So here I am
A million miles away from home
But I really do believe someday my time will come
Then I'll return the prodigal son
Spend the rest of my days loving every single last one

Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And my father will be pacing the floor
Just listen to that fireplace roar
Now really I'd better scurry
Sweetheart, what's your hurry?
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

All the neighbors might think
But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
Oh, I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby, it's cold out there
Oh, this welcome has been
So lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
Oh, my maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooo, baby you're so delicious
Well maybe just one little kiss more
Never such a blizzard before

Oh, I've got to go home
You'll freeze to the bone out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?

Oh, there's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my lifelong sorrow
Well at least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that old out
Baby it's cold outside

Ooo ooo ooo
Hey, I gotta get out of here
Come on, baby
Come on what?
Just give me five minutes more

Is a suitcase and trunk

Is when he's on a drunk

When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm
But there I was
Hmm, I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said,

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Take the wine dig that girl
Spill the wine, dig that girl
Spill the wine, dig that girl, come on, come on

Contrasting against the sky
Tumbled down black shacks over the tracks
Children so hungry they could cry

The chrome, the steel, the metal dream
Leaving the teepee to rot
The escapist young mind, left behind
Saving dimes for community pot

You better get straight
Better, better get straight
I feel you better get straight right now
Better get straight, babe

They're crying out for love all the time
But they fail to see the neighbors eyes
The TV is on, 6 o clock news
And channels in full colored lies

The company meets, the president speaks
He's young but his bones creak
Young girl dresses for the high school dance
And the guy next door is dying for a beat

Get straight, you better
Yes, you better get straight, babe
Did you hear what I said?
I said to you, that you, you better get straight

They put a bible in a drawer of the motel room
And it's crying out to be read
But it stays right there, collecting dust
No one understands what's being said

Lovers make love in country boxes
What will tomorrow bring?
They've been told that it's wrong
But they don't give a damn
Soon another life it will bring

Yeah, you better get straight, baby

Everything was getting hazy
Friends looked at me and said,
Man, you gotta be crazy

Oh, oh leader

My leader said son you'd better get yourself together
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road

Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
If this was good for me I just couldn't see it
A motorist picked me up and said
Look man, you must be crazy

Oh, oh leader

Well at least I really knew that my leader really cared
After giving me a second-hand roach
He said where's your donation man,
It's all for a good cause.

He left me all alone to work the riddle out
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
They stuck a hypodermic deep down into me
Said, look out nurse I think we got a loony

Oh, oh leader
Okay baby follow me now
Follow your leader
All right

Now here I sit in a state-run asylum
Limitless, friendless but much more together
I decided to do some good book readin'
About the art of people leadin'

Now I'm the leader and they're being led

Being the leader is really where its at
But just how long can a good thing last

That blooms in the spring
Her hair like the lily
Thet grows in yon valley

should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones...

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

[Spoken]
I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
so it's all in my head
and then.. I heard her say one more time:

[Sung]
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

[Spoken]
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said:

He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
In the words that he said

How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky.

The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well

(gregorian chants) 
The bell tolls 
The black plague has struck
Diseased eyes roll upwards
As if knowing which direction their souls will travel
(bring out your dead)
A woman in black cries
As the deathly procession passes by
And monks moan en masse
Ohohohohohoh
(gregorian chants)
The yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door
For it is safer inside the walls
Their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard
The bodies of unfortuates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls
And ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches.
(bring out your dead)
And the bell tolls on
A man walks around the castle walls on the outside
The light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves
He tends the sick
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
But he feels it most for the children
(unclean)
Tears glisten on his cheek
Did man ever deserve this death?
And not all will die, just the poor 
For the rich are inside the castle walls
And he knows he could be with them
And they laugh at this fool of a man 
Through the stone fortress windows
And the bell tolls on
(unclean)
And many deaths and many days later
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain 
For tears can never erase the pain of death
Only time has that talent
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
(bring out your dead)
The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
Life for the people flowers again
They breathe fresh air like they did once before
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
The bell has stopped
And only silence is heard
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within
In their bones they feel something is wrong
The bell has been silent much too long
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
No one came and no one went
Fear can do many strange things
And even though water ran low
Their mouths burnt and bellys caked dry
Not one person put a foot outside
No one had that much courage
For they feared the peasants and their world outside
So they played it safe and didn't move
But one by one they perished and died",The Black Plague,1967

I knew she could not be reached, for my mind was forever wondering
Far above his head, as he tried his best to teach me

Black coal, coal black pit yacka's face, escaping the coal dust blast
Blind pony stumblin' to the light of day, to retire in the green fields forever
And I'll build me a bridge of steel, to beat the black river forever
I'll beat that black river forever, I'll beat that muddy river forever

The smell of gun grease
and the bayonets they shine
He's there to help them all that he can
To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man
Sky pilot,
Sky pilot,
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky.

He smiles at the young soldiers
Tells them it's all right
He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight
Soon there'll be blood and many will die
Mothers and fathers back home they will cry
Sky pilot,
Sky pilot,
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky.

He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile
The order is given
They move down the line
But he'll stay behind and he'll meditate
But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate

As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
in the words that he said
Sky pilot,
Sky pilot,
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky.

You're soldiers of God, you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell

In the morning they return
With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words
""Thou shalt not kill.""

Contrasting against the sky.

Leaving the teeth which will rot.

Saving dimes for community pot.

You better get it 
You better, you better get straight baby

They're crying out for love all the time,
But they fail to see the neighbors eyes.
The TV is on the six o'clock news,
And the channels are full color lies.
Company meets, the president speaks, 
He's young but his bones creak.
Young girl dresses for the high school dance 
And the guy next door is dying for a peek.

Before it's too late

They put the Bible in the drawer of the motel room,
And its crying out to be read.
But is stays right there collecting dust,
No one understands what's being said.
Lovers make love in concrete boxes,
What will tomorrow bring?
They've been told that its wrong but they don't give a damn,
Soon another life it will bring

Yeah, you,
You better get straight baby

The river was deep and the weather was winter
After a sailer very kindly saved me

I took it so easy my leader called me lazy

Through the lack of red meat
Everything was getting hazy
Friends looked at me and said,
Man, you gotta be crazy

Oh, oh leader

My leader said son you'd better get yourself together
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road

Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
If this was good for me I just couldn't see it
A motorist picked me up and said
Look man, you must be crazy

Oh, oh leader
Oh, oh leader

My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
Well at least I really knew that my leader really cared
After giving me a second-hand roach
He said where's your donation man,
It's all for a good cause.

He left me all alone to work the riddle out
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
They stuck a hypodermic deep down into me
Said, look out nurse I think we got a loony

Oh, oh leader
Okay baby follow me now
Follow your leader
All right

Now here I sit in a state-run asylum
Limitless, friendless but much more together
I decided to do some good book readin'
About the art of people leadin'

Now I'm the leader and they're being led
What's the matter if they're crazy till you hear what I've said
Being the leader is really where its at
But just how long can a good thing last

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy

She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery

The birds in the bushes

Her hair like the lily
Thet grows in yon valley

No complaints

Hand it out

And baby (baby)

It's my life and I'll do what I want

Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl 

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day 
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest 
in a big field of tall grass 
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face 

And I fell asleep and dreamed 
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie 
And that I was the star of the movie 
This really blew my mind, the fact that me, 
an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome 
should be the star of a Hollywood movie 

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings 
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world 
In front of every kind of girl, there was 
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones... 

Out of the middle came a lady 
She whispered in my ear something crazy 
She said: 

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl 
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl 

(spoken:) 

I thought to myself what could that mean 
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream 
Now, wait a minute 
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere 
so it's all in my head 
and then.. I heard her say one more time: 

(sung:) 

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl 
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl 


(spoken:) 
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back 
As she disappeared, but soon she returned 
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass 
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass 
And raised it to her lips 
And just before she drank it, she said: 

(sung:) 
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl 
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl ",Spill the Wine,2000

The bell tolls 
The black plague has struck
Diseased eyes roll upwards
As if knowing which direction their souls will travel
(bring out your dead)

A woman in black cries
As the deathly procession passes by
And monks moan en masse

[Gregorian chants]

The yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door
For it is safer inside the walls
Their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard
The bodies of unfortunates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls
And ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches.
(bring out your dead)

And the bell tolls on
A man walks around the castle walls on the outside
The light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves
He tends the sick
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
But he feels it most for the children
(unclean)

Tears glisten on his cheek
Did man ever deserve this death?
And not all will die, just the poor 
For the rich are inside the castle walls
And he knows he could be with them
And they laugh at this fool of a man 
Through the stone fortress windows
And the bell tolls on
(unclean)

And many deaths and many days later
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain 
For tears can never erase the pain of death
Only time has that talent
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
(bring out your dead)

The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
Life for the people flowers again
They breathe fresh air like they did once before
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
The bell has stopped

And only silence is heard
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within
In their bones they feel something is wrong
The bell has been silent much too long
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
No one came and no one went
Fear can do many strange things

And even though water ran low
Their mouths burnt and belly's caked dry
Not one person put a foot outside
No one had that much courage
For they feared the peasants and their world outside
So they played it safe and didn't move
But one by one they perished and died",The Black Plague,2001

Eric Cantona,"Un jour, peut-être pas le jour le plus froid du monde,
Mais pas loin, je décidais de retirer mon horloge.
De lourds flocons gorgés de pluie s'amoncelaient sur mes épaules
""C'est un bon jour pour s'arracher le cœur"" me suis-je dit.

Lorsque j'ai tiré dessus,
J'ai eu l'impression qu'un bulldozer était en train de tout casser entre mes poumons.
Les gens disent qu'on voit une lumière très intense quand la mort arrive,
En ce qui me concerne, je n'ai vu que des ombres.
Des ombres géantes, à perte de vue et une tempête de neige aux flocons noirs.

La neige recouvrait progressivement mon corps,
D'abord les mains, puis les bras écartés.
Des roses semblaient pousser de la neige tellement le sang gorgeait la poudreuse,
Puis elles se sont effacées.
Mon visage, puis mon corps tout entier ont disparu.

J'étais étrangement détendu et anxieux en même temps,
Comme si je me préparais à un très long voyage en avion.
Un dernier bouquet d'étincelles a poussé sous mes paupières,
Le souvenir de Miss Acacia dansant en équilibre sur ses petits talons aiguilles,
Docteur Madeleine penchée sur moi, remontant l'horloge de mon coeur,

And in September when I first realized
That I needed you to be the other half of me
And my love long locked inside itself had finally been set free

I can remember autumn skies and goodbyes
Hurting so badly that I thought I would die
But the more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
And the lonely ones get lonelier with every passing day

From the day we met I knew that
I should never let you get a hold on me
'Cause now you see I can't forget you
Oh I, I can remember mid summer skies, love in your eyes

In the spring the sun will shine and make
The ice surrender but it will not warm
My heart as long as I remember
Oh I, I can remember mid summer skies, love in your eyes

And I, I will remember the times I've cried
Since you said goodbye, I nearly died when you said

I, I can't let you down any more
So I guess this is goodbye
What, what did you do it for?
Every time I think of you and him together
I break down and cry

Since you said goodbye

Since you said goodbye

Can the future be foretold
In a faded photograph
Can a dream be bought or sold

Sippin' on a scotch and soda
A shadow in the corner booth
So philosophic and drunk on grown-up truth.
Half-forgotten fragments
Of a high school dance
In the dead white hours of winter
When we loved so hard
That we thought it would never end
Trying to remember
How it used to feel
When a kiss was something special
And I wonder now
Will it ever be again

Eric Carmen,"She was just an average blue-eyed
Golden high school dream
An illusion nothing real could ever touch
Funny love seemed so much more intense
At seventeen
When I knew she'd never love me
Half as much

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

Trades were made for promises
Of a timeless memory
And I knew but still refused to comprehend
The fantasy more glamorous
Then she could ever be
Was the course of least resistance
In the end

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

Long ago an innocence
Lived deep within my soul
In a yesterday where love
And dreams remain
But disillusion clouds my eyes
And the winter takes it's toll
For the spring has gone
And will not come again

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

Take it or leave it
Won'tcha take my love or set me free

Won'tcha save me from this misery
(Listen, you better)
Take it or leave it
You've been sleepin' on it much too long
And in the bank of my love
Your account's already overdrawn
I was never a believer in synthetic affection
Love is here or it was never really there at all
But there's a rumor goin' round
While I was out on the road
You were out on the town

Take it or leave it
Won'tcha take my love or set me free

Won'tcha save me from this misery
I used to think that you and me
Were different from all the rest
Well I'm a jealous man
Don't you put me to the test
I doubt there ever was a woman
That was sheer perfection
But I never want to see you with another man
You better make your mind up fast
'Cause I'm in love with you now
But it ain't gonna last

Eric Carmen,"On this night
On any hot, summer night
Every girl
Every red-blooded boy
Is cryin' out
With one great voice
They want to jump
They want to turn up the noise

And that's the sound
That's the thunderin' sound
Of clappin' hands
And of stompin' their feet
Coast to coast
Like a national heart
Watch them go
Go wild in the street

Every kid in the u.s.a.
Is comin' out to play
It's American as apple pie
Livin' hard, riding high
Feelin' every minute like the 4th of July

I got one fine girl
She's got hair
Like Kansas wheat
She can move
Like a New York street
And she can kiss
She can kiss so sweet

On this glorious night
We got plans
We got red, hot schemes
Of bustin' out
Before we break at the seams
We'll cut a piece

I was wondering how my friends have changed
I was thinking bought a certain girl
I was hoping to find there
I walked in and she caught my eye
Though she was standing with another guy
All the years seemed to fade away
Could it be she still remembered

She remembered
It was so long ago
Could we ever feel that way again
She remembered
Making love 'neath the stars
Oh, the world was so much younger then
When we kissed and my heart stood still
I said I loved her and I always will
'Cause dreams are forever
And some things you never forget

She introduced me to the guy she was with
Then I asked her if she'd like to dance
We hit the floor as the band began
Our favorite old slow song
I pulled her close and to my surprise
I heard her whisper as she closed her eyes,
""God it's just like it used to be
I wasn't sure if you'd remember""

I remember
It was so long ago
Could we ever feel that way again

There's romance in the sunset

Maybe we're older
Maybe we're colder

While we cling to our illusions once again

While the years keep slippin' away

Who can move me the way you do

But she appeared like an angel of tenderness
Sent from above, oh and she was bringing me love.

Oh mama, she did it
Woh momma, she did it, yeah, etc.

Looking back, making love was meaningless
'Till she touched me with her warmth

I like the colors
I like the way they move
They're all so brilliantly realized
They just could not be improved

I love the way the sex is so overt
I love the way the violence doesn't hurt

It's a cartoon world
It's exactly as it seems
And it's bigger than life
And better than all your dreams

It's a cartoon world
It's a safer place to be
And it's better than real
A perfect facsimile
It's a cartoon world

I like the things their saying
I like the way they're said
I like to change the channels
While I'm lying in my bed

From the commercial to the anchorman
They've done research on my attention span

It's a cartoon world
It's exactly as it seems
And it's smaller than life
And better than all your dreams

It's a cartoon world
It's a safer place to be
And it's better than real
And bigger than you and me

And the stars are brighter
They've got more charisma
And more style than you and me

I watch the news on tv
It doesn't mean a thing to me
What's a little ethnic cleansing?
That's the way it's always been

I was excited when the war began
Now I've got Game Boy, I'm a happy man

Howling in the heat

Breaking hearts, but looking awful pretty
Baby, not so fast

We can drive to forever tonight
Hey baby, the right time's finally here
The top down time of the year

Take your Mustang off the blocks
Ain't nobody walks when it's so hot

Me and you
We can ride to town in style
Flash 'em all a smile
And you know what

I'm so high whenever we're together
I wish we could feel this way forever
Love is weatherproof
C'mon raise the roof

Eric Carmen,"And when I see the sign that points ""One Way ""
The one we used to pass by every day

Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame

From deep inside the fear that I forced aside
From deep inside the pain that I chose to hide

Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home

Eric Carmen,"Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
I asked her if she'd wait for me
But I was gone too long
Tears were in her eyes
She said I took our love and threw it away
And nothin' I could do or say
Could bring it back again

I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
I never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see

I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough

She walked out that door
And all my dreams went with her into the night
I wondered how a love so right
Could ever slip away
Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
That somewhere deep inside of me
She'll always be the one

You've got your palm springs tan in the new york news
You don't like champagne but you take another sip
Inside your private club for the tragically hip

In an endless string of one more nights

You need some lovin' to get you through the night
You need some good man to make you feel right
You need that tender touch in the red dawn light
You need some lovin' to get'cha through the night

You're lookin' for a romance
But you're in the wrong place
You feel that hunger but you know you can't taste
So you find some substitute but it leaves you so cold
Too many heartaches, well, they're making you old

Dreamin' your unlimited dreams
But your stockings kinda look a little
Frayed around the seams

You blew your brains out in the bathroom sink
Look in the mirror and see between the lines
You can run forever but you can't stop time

She said, ""Just keep it raw, the lyrics hardcore""
Listen to my talk and get up, I'm on the corner with my

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, OK, what should I write next?
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""
""Hey yo, your cousin Rohann...""
""Uh-huh""
""Who used to sell bang""
""Uh-huh""
""DT's found his hand in the back of Bennigans""
""What?""
""In a plastic bag with a note attached""
""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left
To my surprise, it was my sis, Melky Sedeck

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way

One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

You're shootin' in the opposite position
I'm thinkin', ""Should I fire or hold back on ammunition
On your wig transition?""
My mission, like Take 6, is to spread love
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes
You gonna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death
You provoke the cycle, call Michael
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple
Like the color, you holler, bawlin' for your mother
No-one hears you even though you knock
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock
Things done changed since your spark got hot
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own Glock

Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you
Love guys like me

Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick

Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do

And an Arizona morning where God paints the sky
And these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne

Started stringin' chords and words into songs

A siren with gold eyes,
She'll cut you with her kindness,
She will lead you with her lies
She's been called a glistening devil,
She's good at keeping score
If you make it she's your savior
If you don't she's a whore

The roads to and from her heart are littered with grave souls.
They gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes.
Sure we've all heard about Shell, and Chris, Willy, and Bobby Bares.
She'd smiled on Johnny's the Merles any music-wrote billionaires.
Like a beacon she goes seeking seed, her loins so fertile.
To a free man she's a prison, to a caged one she's a fire.

She's the reason there's a Sunday morning coming down.
I saw the light, a boy named Sue,
He stopped loving her today. The pill and 16th avenue.
The rhyming, oh she's a diamond the brown eyed mickey
She was Roy Acuff castle and Elvis parsley's broken dream
Its not all bad its not all dark its not all gloom and crass,
But to mine gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass.
For she's seem 'em come and seen 'em go, and came herself a time or two.

No matter how satisfied her scream sounds she always wants someone new.
The next him or them or her or all to the rest of them all
Be a star in this lady's town you can fuck or you can fight.

You see, it all comes down to money.
Not romantic art of days gone past, if you forget that rule,
You can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass.
A tramp, a slut, a bitch, a mutt, a thousand pawn shop guitars.
A nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart.
She lurks in friendly shadows, but she's a junky with a limb.
The agents are her bookie and the labels are her pen
I'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide
The devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride

All the chaos he has caused, and done
His greatest tribute to every guitar-toting' dreamer

And then go straight the hell.","Devil, Devil (Prelude: Princess of Darkness)",2014

But you kept me from going under

And a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal

Who knew gray hairs like to hide on a head,

I'd poison never, shoot goodbye
Beat regret when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound fear to a pile of sand
Choke lonely out with my bare hands
I'd hang hate so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

I'd take brokenness out back
And break heartbreak, stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put upset down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of disgrace
Lay over under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
'Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn lies and hate to love and truth
If I could only kill a word

I'd knock out temptation's teeth
I'd sever evil, let it bleed
Then light up wicked, stand and watch it burn
I'd take vice and I'd take vile
And tie 'em up there with hostile
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word

Screaming louder than the pain

My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart

It's no contest tonight

Or the cold spot in our bed

The whiskey soothes, but I toss and turn

A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City

The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Eric Church,"My daddy had a Pontiac on the beiger side of yellow
He was a young man then and I was a little fella
I'd play in that bench back seat and listen to the songs get sung
He couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but he'd sing at the top of his lungs

Carry On My Wayward Son on the hippie radio
Songs about the flower babies and the birth of rock and roll
And I was a band, I would stand and we'd bounce down the road
A boy and his dad in a Pontiac with that hippie radio

Can't' remember if it was seventeen, maybe eighteen is right
But I'll never forget those baby blues and the glow of that dashboard light
I'd won her heart the week before and it was hot right from the start
I busted her brother Billy's mouth for makin' fun of my car

And it was White Wedding and Rebel Yell on the hippie radio
I was a Werewolf in London, and she was Lady Marmalade's soul
And I'd crank the band, take her hand and we'd pull off back a road
A boy and his girl in a Pontiac, and the hippie radio

Four years and seven days from tying cans to the bumper
I was pacing a maternity floor, my flower baby was a mother
My hands were shaking as we were leaving, taking our boy home
My heart was full and in my head I could hear a long, long song

Cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon on the hippie radio
A-B-C, 1-2-3, don't blink or he'll be gone

And prove time-travel ain't crazy as hell
They've even got a pill to make a soft package hard
But as far as we've came
When it comes to love and to blame
And the breaking of a loved heart
I think we're sorely lacking methods
So I'm going with old time-tested
A jukebox and a bar

One pushes me up the mountain
And one rolls me down the hill
While I sit in a phosphorescent dark
So you can keep your fancy potions
And your incandescent notions
As for me and my barely-beating heart
There's no better prescription
For my broken disposition
Than a jukebox and a bar

We got pinpoint GPS
All you need is an address
But her love is the one thing I can't find
Meanwhile no one has a clue
How to make her memory turn loose
So much for academic minds

Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

The wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart
A minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark
Greed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap
You can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that

Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said

I smile and say ""All clear"" when I tuck him in for the night
But Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?

Eric Clapton,"After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
After midnight, we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
We're gonna stimulate some action
We're gonna get some satisfaction
We're gonna find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down (after midnight, after midnight)

After midnight, we're gonna shake your tambourine (after midnight, after midnight)
After midnight, it's all gonna be peaches and cream (after midnight, after midnight)
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
We're gonna give an exhibition
We're gonna find out what it is all about (what it is all about) (what it is all about)
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down (we're gonna let it all hang down)
(We're gonna let it all hang down)
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down

After midnight, we're gonna shake your tambourine
(We're gonna shake your tambourine) (we're gonna shake your tambourine)
After midnight, it's all gonna be peaches and cream
(We're gonna shake your tambourine) (we're gonna shake your tambourine)
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
We're gonna give an exhibition
We're gonna find out what it is all about (what it is all about, what it is all about)
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down (after midnight, after midnight)

After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
(We're gonna let it all hang down) we're gonna let it all hang down)
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
(We're gonna let it all hang down) (we're gonna let it all hang down)
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
