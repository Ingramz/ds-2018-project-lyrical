Greg Chaisson,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now",Fire And Rain,1991
Greg Chaisson,"Love, love, love, love

Oh my sweet young child
Livin' heartache alone, pictures cry on the wall
Whispered sins, never 'prise me to fall
Now you're twistin' it all

Wasted days are bringin' me down
Oh girl, I'm losin' you
Shattered dreams, spinnin' me 'round
Oh girl, what can I do?

The last time I said I'm fallin' in love
Girl, it's the last time I said I'm fallin' in love
No, no, no, yeah

I remember that night and that very blind kiss
You knew I'd never love on a lie
But time after time I'd be down on my knees
Beggin' like never before

Wasted days are bringin' me down
Oh girl, I'm losin' you
Shattered dreams, spinnin' me 'round
Oh girl, what can I do?

The last time I said I'm fallin' in love
Girl, it's the last time I said I'm fallin' in love
No, no, no, yeah

Girl, it's the last time I said I'm fallin' in love
Yes, it's the last time I said I'm fallin' in love
You know, it's the last time, baby, said I'm fallin' in love
The last time I said I'm fallin in love
No, no, no

Girl, it's the last time, yeah I said I'm falling for your love
Last time for love

Greg Chako,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,
Greg Chako,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,
Greg Chako,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Greg Chako,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Greg Chako,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain

Greg Chako,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1996

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is

Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years

And day by day my love seems to grow

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999

Greg Duncan,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy

Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he finally saved enough for us to go
California was his dream, a paradise that he had seen
The pictures and the magazines had told him so

California cotton fields, where labor camps were filled with worried men and broken dreams
California cotton fields was as close to wealth as Daddy ever came

Almost everything we owned was sold or left behind
From Daddy's tools to the fruit that Momma canned
Some folks came to say farewell and see all we had to sell
Some just came to shake my Daddy's hand

The Model T was loaded down and California bound
The dream of hope was just four days away
But the only change that I remember seein' in my daddy
Was when his brown hair turned to silver gray

Echoes of ages in canyons of rust,
Is heaven so lonely? I'll know soon enough

Wasting away blood, sweat, and grime

The tools of the trade lie shopworn and old
The skills of the master done died with his soul
And the worklike routine is so lonely and cold

Cold as the clay, dark as the mine,
Wasting away, blood, sweat and grime,
Panning for gold, picking for dimes, lying in wait for better times

The village expanded, some say it's improved,

Bummed a ride home, got in to bed, 44 smokeless under my head

I began to think what the deed I'd done, grabbed my hat and away'd I run,
Made a good run just a little too slow, (they) overtook me in Jericho

Standin' on the corner, ringin' the bell, up walks the sheriff from Thomasville
Says ""young man is your name Brown? 'Member that night you shot Sadie down?""

Oh yes sheriff my name is Lee, I murdered little Sadie in the first degree,

He asked her to meet him at Adams's spring, said he'd bring her money and other fine things,
So fool-like she met him at Adams's spring, no money he brought her nor other fine things

John Lewis, John Lewis, won't you tell me your mind, do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?
Little Omie, Little Omie, I will tell you my mind, my plan is to drown you and leave you behind,
Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life, I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife

He hugged her and he kissed her and turned her around and threw her in deep water where he knew that she
Would drown,
It was on one Thursday morning the rain came pouring down and they searched for Omie's body but it
Nowhere could be found,
Two boys went a fishin' one fine summer day and they saw little Omie's body go floating away

They called for John Lewis to come to that place so he could see her body and they could see his face,
Though he made no confession they threw him in jail, no friend nor relation would go on his bail

",Omie Wise,2006

And the forest was dark and primeval but the boughs seemed to cradle as they swayed,
And the church choir sang hallelujah, and the vernal breeze whispered a sigh,
Watch the brethren all stand, praise their God, raise your hand,
Tow the bell for the Rebel's goodbye

When the boots hit the dirt in formation the mood was determined and bright,
And a young, hopeful boy at the station watched the train carry troops to the fight,
But the generals died by assassins, the battalions dispersed on the fly,
And they paid for their sins with the blood of their kin,
Tow the bell for the Rebel's goodbye

In the dark heathen barracks of failure where the tormenters wait for the night,
And the sheltering sky hears their lost, tattered cries,
Tow the bell for the Rebel's goodbye

That very same night little Annie disappeared
In a way no tongue could tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near
She had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home
The body of sweet Annie were found

Her parents now are left alone
One mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door
The body of sweet Annie sleeps

A state that's free and thrives on peace, no greed, no threat to life 

We won't build the weapons of war which looms over your heads 
We'll not feed the war machines that lead our youth to death 
We won't close our eyes to the atrocities which abound 

We won't stand and watch until we're six feet underground 

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch 
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march 
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity 
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace 

Motherfuckers around us who stand and say no way 
Opposing lessened armies, they say are here to stay 
But no one knows until we try, what we all can do 
I won't watch children die, it's up to me and you 

Our world is divided, the boundaries have been drawn 
Ideas are decided by where you have been born 
You can't judge people by the government of their land 
They're flesh and blood like us - why don't you understand? 

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch 
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march 
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity 
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace",One Nation,2002
Greg Harris,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

Blacktop roads were boiling
Making tar stick to your feet
I'd wait for the sun to go down
Then pick you up
We'd try to outrun the heat
We'd drive down by the river
Til we found a summer breeze
Soft as a whisper in some old magnolia trees
It was still too hot to handle
A burning desire
We fooled around and we fell in love
And set that Georgia moon on fire
Summer dreams are hard to find
And even harder to hold
Seems like they just fade away
When a cold wind starts to blow
People said we were too young
To know what love's about
I guess that ol? sun was to blame
We lit a flame that we couldn't put out
We?d drive down by the river
?Til we found a summer breeze
Soft as a whisper in some old magnolia trees
It was still too hot to handle
A burning desire

A burning desire

And set that Georgia moon on fire",Georgia Moon on Fire,1997

Greg Kihn,"Man, I can understand how it might be
Kind of hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
It's my own fault for what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

But you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean I'll never kiss your sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Well, I know they make you sad
They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should
Folks got ways to make you feel no good
I'd guess they've got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And boy, you never lied to me
And the part of you they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do

Along beneath venetian chandeliers
Against the moon her body rocks

No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
No one is to smart

Dreaming of our tangled fates
Her face was like a ghost with eyes of jade
I fell just like a falling star
A victim of this coup d'etat
I could not see behind this masquerade

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
Be careful where you start
In affairs of the heart

Sometimes I think I'll never learn
Were all those promises in vain
Do the wings of fire still remain

All is fair in love and war
The tender draw the shortest straw
Like autumn leaves they vanish in the air
Is this the time we say good-bye
I call her room there's no reply
Tonight we end this fleeting love affair

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
Sharper than a dart

Greg Lake,"I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe this smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidence arose from circumstance
One thing lead to another we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And now you find yourself in eighty two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can't concern yourself with bigger things
You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, the heat of the moment
Shone in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself
Teenage ambition you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

They said there'll be peace on earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the virgin birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winter's light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a silent night
And they told me a fairy story

Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy lamb of god
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the countenance divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark satanic mills?

Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear, oh clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!

Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Til we have built Jerusalem

Take a look down at the madman

Fly beyond reason

As we all kneel pray for guidance

Tread the road cross the abyss

On the streets of the city
Only specters still have pity

Childhood themes of nights alone,
Wipe away endless years,
Childhood tears as dry as stone.

From seeds of confusion,
Illusions darks blossoms have grown.
Even now in furrows of sorrow
The dance still is sung.

My life's course is guided
Decided by limits drawn
On charts of my past days
And pathways since I was born.

I carry the dust of a journey
That cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day.

You and I are yesterday's answers,
The earth of the past came to flesh,
Eroded by Time's rivers
To the shapes we now possess.

Come share of my breath and my substance,
And mingle our stream and our times.
In bright, infinite moments,
Our reasons are lost in our rhymes.

Doubles faces dark defense
Talk too loud but talk no sense
Yeah I see those smiling eyes
Butter us up with smiling lies

Talk to creatures raise the dead
Fate you know sure got fed
Trained apart from houses of stone
Hour of horses pick the bone

Come forth, from love spire
Born in life's fire, 
Born in life's fire. 
Come forth, from love's spire

In the burning, all are yearning,
For life to be.
And the pain will (must) be gain,
New life!

Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams.

They were, sent from (to) the gates
Ride the tides of fate,
Ride the tides of fate.
They were, sent from (to) the gates

In the burning of our yearning,
For life to be.

Greg Leisz,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",El  Gallo del Cielo,1994

I traveled the Indian country
Whispering your name under lonesome skies
Remembering my only company

But my darling dear, please have no fear
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand

To the Sierra gold fields
And I worked my stake on a riverbank?
Dreaming just how a rich man feels

That I return to claim your hand

Now the dead man's lying at my feet
Who tried to steal my earnings
Yet I still recall your tender kiss
Though this bullet in my chest is burning

And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Greg MacDonald,"Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Greg Maroney,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September,2003

Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

Where have I been all these years?

And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,

Finding another world.

I was swerving thru Queens
Fully growin' benz
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My shit is
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar peice
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

Your carmake me hot hot hot

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my icp
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop

You burst out of semi-???
She pulled down the staps to her dress
Reached in the ? sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,
and give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????
Give deep ? to ? man coats
Take off my ??
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turnin' me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""why?""
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid, 
then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll, 
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

Tell me this is bout more than sex and buying weed
Maybe but anyway we burn daily, sip baileys, early sex

Pops raised me through this blind crooked and crazy world
I'm just riding along see where it takes me
Keep buying cars and rims until it breaks me

And I don't fit into society I'm a menace
Slap my balls on ya rack like tennis
And turn the henney up and don't stop till I'm finished
I'm pissy drunk, one shot might get me crunk
Not to mention shawty rollin' up like 50 blunts
Got nappy in this bitch
Sticks to the bricks
I'm a cowboy dog it's to the face though mix

We go ninety in the slow lane with just enough to traffic
Cross the line 'bout forty times a week on an average
Forward then backwards packaged like a sack lunch
Ridin' dirty, high as fuck, puffin on a bad blunt
What's ya ass want? Nappy serve it all day
Always keep it caddy hoggin' dog it's all wood
Too much of anything can make ya think it's all good

Too late, when they dip in the kick they get sprayed

I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and can't lose when I cruise

Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run

Now may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track or should I say dope beat

But they lack the new knack that's coming from way way back
Hey yo Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before we come back with more hits

I know where you think you're going you
I know what you came here for
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going?
I think you better go with me girl

But you still find cause to doubt me
If you ain't with me girl

Well the party's over so now take off your face
You say you love, but it's hard to see
When you're in his arms, throwing rocks at me

I walk around suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room

So take off the mask so I can see your face

Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along

I wish that I could fly away
And party 'til the break of day
And there I'll be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me

Then mama comes and asks me
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find
Someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone

With people packed against the wall
I'm sitting in the corner here
Trying to make some sense of it all

And when I least expect it

Here he is walking up to me and asking

Caught between the madness and the fire.

No longer my legs will run.

I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.

And I don't think I really want to know.

If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.

If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

I got tangled in love, tangled in love.
I got caught up, bought up, strangled, tangled in love.
I got tangled in love, tangled in love.

If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like

The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her

Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

Instruct Anna Sten in diction

Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

Greg Porn,"Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the most high for high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin

Am I a douchebag or just another doo rag?
Tryna get ahead on some brand new wave shit
For your entertainment money is the language
So every time I speak I’m tryna make another payment
I do ‘em dirty sleep and get a dirt nap, that works
Tell my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I woulda learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryna burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin' what’s ironic is
I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But from your legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert
Sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’, trolley hoppin’
Know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
Karate choppin’ in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Jonnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin’ capt'
One of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, “You wanna pay for class? Get on that stage and shake your ass”
She keep a dick in a box and in an emergency break the glass
I make her laugh
She makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks

Running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence

Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying cold blood hearts that never been for love

World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he’s tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I

Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to breaking the law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking of how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose
Get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey

Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool

Hustle anonymous still remain nameless
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike

Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide right pursuers tried like
To no avail and a heroes what they died like

Not in the lime light or needed for the crime right
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line tight

Stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun
Have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese
Free falling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap for all the years
That we spent in luxuries lap
Without looking back
Cause memories could sting like hornet

Yeah speaking of pieces of a man
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter I’m leaving for my fam' but
It’s written in language they will never understand
A late repentant
Never deviating from a plan
I drive by headed for the valley of the damned
The wheels spin, I’m looking for a sacrificial lamb
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan

Was this a matter of flesh and blood
Yes it was
Does it matter who win and lose
Yes it does
It ain’t about the most blessed love

What is it back to the essence of
Greatness I wasn't in the presence of

Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape

Blood sweat and tears broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth
Blow the devil a kiss
Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat

Ain't nobody tell you clowns to speak

Money bag, nice swag, pockets need an ice bag
Toe tag, body bag
Niggas lose their lives sad
Rockets in their flight path
Breaking bad, make them bad
Choices out here thinking fast
Smoking wet and drinking bad
Soaking wet and sinking fast
Shoot them niggas making cash
Stick them niggas take their stash
The law of gravity meets, the law of averages
Ain't no sense in attempting to civilize savages
Even though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment
I'm a nigga, other niggas pale in comparison
We out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing
No idea how much time's left, fuck trying to cherish it
A life in times unchecked, now that's American
Inherit the wind, pressure in everything

The world ain’t ready for someone like me
And life is sex, stress, drama and I’m hookin out 3
I’d rather O.D. than be the next O.G
Than fronting for a whore that already chose me
One man revolution that’s supportin prostitution
I’m trying pimp the game, where balling don’t mean hooping
And riding don’t mean cruising
It mean keep your bitch-ass moving
If you ain’t built for bruising, redrum ain’t in your blueprint
In a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji
On Easy-E and PCP, ass-cash or EBT
How you monetize pigeons on a power line
On a road to the riches every dudes a dollar sign
I don’t mind, I don’t mind, long as all the smoke is mine
And the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa Johns
And I heard that def-ass caller money’s on the other line
The last episode of Good Times is my life

‘Freeze’ they say in the streets when the young players
Get rich or die trying
But the funny thing about that phrase to me
Is that these little niggas be lying
Cause don’t nobody wanna die
But everybody trying to get rich though
But the fucked thing about that
These lil' niggas don’t how to get rich so
I still run with those angels
Man I still P for those angels
Speaking with guns, sticking in tongues
Talking that Arabic and that Yiddish
Riding them trains, stashing them chains, bangles
Yeah I play for those gangsters
My tag on the wall, you niggas look up
You can still see my name yo
How did I end up where I’m at?
It’s kind of hard to explain yo
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and a Kangol
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and some Jordans too
Crossed that bitch, then I got that bitch
Now all I want from her’s an abortion
My mind filled with distortion
My eyelids say caution
Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back
They say it’s gonna cost a fortune
And I wonder if the lord take debit?

If not I ain’t got a whole lot so a nigga like me just can forget it",The Dark (Trinity),2014

Gravedigger, dig a hole that fit a black nigga
My body's stiff as a Madame Tussaud's wax figure
My transformation: a caterpillar from crack
Dealer and back peddler was no less, than spectacular
Yeah I was trappin' money, flippin' like a spatula
Now put that sucker in a box like Dracula
I let the devil in to dance
An electric slide across the line I drew in the sand
Dead, ended
Love is like a harlequin's romance
Lost between sips of liquor, that empty bottle in my hands
It was a shot away, but I never got away
Dreamed a little dream of me, but that was an anomaly

Holy, Sugar, Honey, Ice Tea
I guess that's a prayer for a player like me
In my church clothes bakin' buzz on the bible
The sweet temptation of my grand daddy's rifle
Got me thinking 'bout doing a jihad with these guys
Who only True Religion look better than Levi's
Who baptize glasses with beers and blood stain
You breathing to the choir, that prayer's the drug game
Hallelujah
'Til the cops cough me in the back of a cruiser
Or the fire truck wash my soul down the sewer
I count my blessings and blow it on a nun to resurrect my erection
I pray, I pray, all thoughts go to heaven
Or to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection
So I can pay for my sins on PayPal
Or own a holy ghost, a greyhound

See God's face turn around and run

As the spring lays, crushed beneath the hammer (the invisible flame)
My vision sears the crowded square (as the mouth of injustice grins)
This routed place (fire runs through my veins)
I choose to expire
You're all on the brink of compromise(as the steel in my nerve sets in)
Mass concessions in defeated eyes (I carry the cries)
A terrible kindness to break the thrall (in my end a new world begins)
I strike the match (it's not me who dies)

One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star

Is hard to find
Can't get no rest

You said you're deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always was deadly
Comes in every shape and size

Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried
But you just cant get enough

Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't gainin' no ground
Because my Angel Eyes ain't here

Angel Eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight

So drink up, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

Within me there grows a rhythmic savage beat

Love is ev'rywhere, its magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care

Greg Street,"[Intro: Cee-Lo]
It's 6 O'clock, it's volume 1
Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape

[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last

Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[T.I. and studio engineers interlude convo]

[Verse Four: T.I.]
Open my eyes, see the sunrise
Talkin about memories of G's got my tongue tied
Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

[Outro: Kalage]
All I know
Is I'd been down this road before
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast

Greg Street,"As we approach the current time frame of 1997
With approximately two and a half years before the year 2000
Repeatedly it has been reported that
There will be a time soon approaching
That a major disaster will be striking all levels of existence
It has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be
Approaching in the form of many, many as in squad
Squad as in Flipmode Squad

It has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable blast
That will fuck up everything within it's 360 degree radius
Warning, prepare yourselves, store your food, stamp your paper
Because when this motherfucker gets here
It's about to get real fucked up for everyone and everything
Everywhere!

Well, Busta Rhymes
Come on over here and let me talk to you son
See now, Dolomite just got back from some shit that you about to be it
Well, are you prepared? I hope you are prepared nigga
'Cause you know this is album number two
Yes more bitches than before
There'll be more bitches, more and more and more
More thirsty niggas, tryin' to get inside your shit
Tryin' to throw your whole chemistry off
Oh yes, there's gonna be a lot more money
Yes a lot more money than before

So son, don't you worry about none of that shit
All you gotta do is just slap your dick
In the mouth of these bitches that don't wanna act right
And put a hot one in any motherfucker
That wants to get in the way of this powerful shit right here
Okay son, all right Busta enough of this shit talkin'
Let's be on our way 'cause when disaster strikes
There's gonna be a whole lot of motherfuckers pourin' in
All right baby, let's go

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Goin' out to all you motherfuckers across the globe
On the return trip, it be the niggas
The niggas that live by the code of blood honor

Spliff bring you that shit to another extreme
Her to hit you motherfuckers with a strike of disaster

I bring on to you once again

Fresh off of the plane I jets off in the Range
First class seat but this west coast ain't the same
The rap game will put stress, fortune, and fame
A slow drive-by when they aired out Kane
S55 all cleared out chain
They body me, you body them, support there out prayin
My only wish is to find ya catcher
Lay ya ass on a stretcher, betcha, getcha, ass out the hood
All I got is rap for that, I spazz out for good
That's my income, it keeps me in Paz and Hollywood
I'm hardly home, when I leave the club the party gone
And I'm pissy off patrone, tryna get ma home
My name Banks baby, I'm top rank lady
I gotta go, grab ya coat, bitch you ain't crazy
I speed off, gainin and rushin, and bend her over somethin
And I'm pumpin, devyin till the macs and I'm frontin
All of a sudden she down on the humble for a feel
And I'm driftin in and out of lane, fumblin the wheel
A couple of miles later I be cummin on her grill
Then its back to the hotel and chill

Ma I give you the rush
Damn ma, ya lil outfit got my third hand high
And I need ya to understand I
Ain't really got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind its me

Got new outfit ain't even out in the states
So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day

Take a day off hit park and just hang

If it's beef put down the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your swift and blow your sss
But dot real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24's do your thang and rep your hood

Get money!""

Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiler chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit

She a bitch, shawty mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy sticks
She a bit, make her flip a brick, make her sic a chick
Since legit, I've been swaggin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit

I met a girl named Suzie, I let her join my group
I know she's not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I snatched her in my fender while I stashed her in my tire
Suzie is a money maker but that bitch a liar

Suzie rollin' '08 'Rarri but that girl on fire
Pull us over, Calla Road, and say she has a price
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singin' like Mariah
Singin' like the choir, better yet, singin' like Mya, bitch

Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates are my treat

How neat, she loves to eat, we eat, bon appetite
We feed, she's so neat and like me she so neat

Nigga always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clip I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-not's

My hoes pose wit pops like young Goldie Locks
We got white bulgin' rocks, zip lock stocks the car

Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

Greg Trooper,"She lives close to the tracks
So she never sleeps a wink
The trains run all night
Give her plenty time to think

About the love that she had
To a man brave and true
And how that love turned bad
The way love's bound to do

They'd have candle light meals
They'd drink wine from Bordeaux
They'd make love every night
The moon hung low

But he stopped coming home
He stopped paying the bills
She had to move to this house
By the tracks down the hill

She'd call her mom and her dad
But they wouldn't understand
They'd say what did you do
To that hard working man

She'd call her brother down south
But he'd never call her back
He's got his house down a hill
Next to his own railroad tracks

So what happens now
What should she do?
She can't fall asleep
And dream a love brand new

Up in the air
She sees birds and planes
You know she'd go anywhere
To get away from these trains

'Cause whenever you come on by
You welcome me over your shoulder
Then you hang me out to dry

Are you mean because it's in your nature?
For me it's kind of hard to tell
The boys say, ""Can't you see she hates you?""
I think you're lonely as a cheap motel

But in your eyes, tell me what I see
Just a hint of love peeking out at me
I don't care how small just a little taste
Might not be for me at all
But Alice, don't let it go to waste

Alice, you would walk for miles
For the chance to put me in my place
Beg me to come a little closer
Then you tell me I'm a big disgrace

Your mama was a double martini
And your daddy gave up wearing clothes
Now you're as cold as the Arctic Circle
Living where nobody goes

But in your eyes, tell me what I see
Just a hint of love peeking out at me
I don't care how small, just a little taste
Might not be for me at all
But Alice, don't let it go to waste

And say I've got it easy
If this is easy
I'll take a bite out of my shoes

One glass of wine
And I'm feeling pretty weary
But I'll be just fine
Once I dream away these blues

I got nothing to say
And I'm looking like a scarecrow
You say I'm wasting away
And you don't care if I do

I'm just a bit tired
And lack a little motivation
But I'll be just fine
Once I dream away these blues

I'll be a dancing child
I'll be the Hallelujah chorus
Turn the TV on
I'll be the breaking news

I just need some time
To shake off half a century
Back in the world I'll climb
Once I dream away these blues

So come on, babe
Don't look so disheartened
Unlike before
These dreams will come true

So fill my glass
The wine will help me get started
I'll be coming back fast

Once again when you got home from work
Well, you know I did too
I got 'em hurt by you

We yelled like little kids
At the stupid little things, we both did
And I made you cry
Then punched the sky

We let it go on so very long
Pretending like there's nothin' wrong
We both moved underground
And forgot about the love, we once found

You work your fingers numb
From before the dawn to the setting sun
I've gone away somewhere
We make a lonely pair

You got your feelings hurt
And now you don't know, what would be worse
Livin' separately
Or just unhappily

There might be somethin' we didn't try
We could talk about the way, we both feel inside
Tears might fall, tempers fly
We might try to get acquainted before we say goodbye

Did her heart start that low?
Did she always believe
Love always deceives?
Was it always so?

No matter what you do
She'll pay no mind to you
To make her know you care
Is futile as a prayer

She's a mining town
After the mine's shut down
Coal turned to diamonds
She won't let you find them

She might attempt a smile
But it works in reverse

Shuffle, panic madly up and down the line
Hoppers, dopers, sober smokers confounding everybody
Treating everyone so kindly except themselves sometimes

Weathers-beaten, losin' cheatin' singin' taller stories
Satisfaction guaranteed if you hit the note tonight
Morning coffee allegory keep our engines running
Your loving something always trumps those things we never tried

Got a line and a pole and a dry fishing hole
And I start to pack it in, then I think of you my friends

Sleepers, weepers, faithless leapers up to ten, 12 inch speakers
Send them in to Karl, they'll need an overhaul
Tin pan alley, Rand Mac Nally read my fortune long tall sally
We might have missed the boat but we all made it to the ball

Making something out of nothing heart a pounding
Stomach rumbling, everyone I meet, everywhere I go
Hackers, slackers, sixteen trackers someone pass the telecaster
And if you've got to ask well there's a chance you'll never know

There's house in a town where only ghosts can be found
And I feel like moving in till I think of you my friends

Paper pushers, talent brokers, no they're not all thieves and hookers
Out of luck, out of work, never out of dreams
So where for art thou romeo, we'd even take a cameo
Just point us to the station and put us on the train

Greg Vail,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,2001
Greg Vail,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,2001
Greg Vail,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Destination Rome
Georgia ain't no paradise
But a place I just call home

I sat next to a broken hearted bride
She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow

I tried to get her talkin'
She didn't have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way

She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window
At the pine trees and the rain
It wasn't her day

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain
The hours that we talked
Seemed like minutes all in vane

I watched
As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin'

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known
Multicolored lady
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home

Oh, by the way, I'm bound for Rome

'Cause oh, somehow it means so much to me
And if you ever need me, you know just where I'll be
So please call home, if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

I guess I saw it comin', day by day
But oh, I could not stand the failure
Before you leave, there's just one thing I must say
Please call home, if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

And I know, that you're used to runnin'
Oh you're lost baby, and I ain't funnin'
But oh, when you call to me, well, I'll come runnin'
Safe to your side, again I'll confide in you

So go ahead on, I won't say no more
My heart ain't in it but I'll hold the door
But just remember what I said before
Please call home, if you change your mind

Please call home, if you change your mind
Please call home, if you change your mind

",Please Call Home,1973
Gregg Allman,"Once I was glad
Always happy never sad
And every day
Seemed like Sunday
And although things were slow
Never seemed to have no dough
Somehow, I never once got lonely

Ya' see the fact is more or less
You're gamblin' with your own happiness
And most all your would be friends
Turn out so phoney
Oh but times they change
And rearrange

And I'll sing to the Queen of Hearts
Don't know where to start
Or how to stop

And after things have come and gone
Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I wasted so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
T'Leave it lay just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find it gone

I love you queen of Hearts
Tell me not to stop
Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

And after all that we've been through
I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through
And in my heart
There's only you
And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange piece of mind
Without it there'd be
Lonely me and
Oh darlin' lonely you

I love you Queen of Hearts

Georgia ain't no paradise

She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow

I tried to get her talkin'
She didn't have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way

She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window
At the pine trees and the rain
It wasn't her day

You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain
The hours that we talked
Seemed like minutes all in vane

I watched
As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin'

In your eyes you turn away
And there's nothing as loud
As the words we never say

Look at us now, it's not too late to try again

Evidence of love, to keep me going
Show me some evidence of love
And I'll be here

I still believe we can see this through
There's just so much, that I can do

Just need a place where I can lay my head
Hey mister can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?
He just grinned, shook my hand, 'no' was all he said

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
and put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
I said, 'Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'
She said, 'I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around'

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
'Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?'
He said, 'Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?'

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, 'I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog'

He said, 'That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can'

Gregg Allman,"When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
And the hot sun chills me to the bone
When I can't hear the song for the singer
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone

I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
And the stars start to splatter in the sky
When the moon splits the southwest horizon
With the scream of an eagle on the fly

I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And listen to the ripples as they moan
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

Black muddy river
Roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide
If you got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river
Black muddy river roll

Black muddy river
Roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide
If you got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river
Black muddy river roll

When it seems like the night will last forever
And there's nothing left to do but count the years
When the strings of my heart start to sever
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears

I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And dream me a dream of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
And sing me a song of my own",Black Muddy River,2017

Gregg Allman,"Once I was a soldier
And I fought on foreign sands for you
Once I was a hunter
And I brought home fresh meat for you
Once I was a lover
And I searched behind your eyes for you
And soon there'll be another
To tell you I was just a lie

And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me

And though you have forgotten
All of our rubbish dreams
I find myself searching
Through the ashes of our ruins
For the days when we smiled
And the hours that ran wild
With the magic of our eyes
And the silence of our words

And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me",Once I Was,2017
Gregg Allman,"When least expected
Fate stumbles in
Bringing light to the darkness
Oh, what a friend

I needed someone to call my own
Suddenly, out left field
Out left field, out left field
Love came along, ooh

I was walking down a road that went no where
Building dreams that were all left by the way side
And then outta the blue
Honey, I found you, oh, yeah

Sugar and peaches in a paradise land
Good love and sweetness, have taken their stand
She made a mountain of love
From a little grain of sand

Suddenly, out of left field
Came a lover and a friend
She was a lover and a friend
Came out of nowhere

She made me a man

How sweet it is",Out of Left Field,2017
Gregg Allman,"Though Adam was a friend of mine, 
I did not know him well 
He was alone into his distance 
He was deep into his well 
I could guess what he was laughing at, 
But I couldn't really tell 
Now the story's told that Adam jumped, 
But I've been thinking that he fell 

Together we went traveling, 
As we received the call 
His destination India, 
And I had none at all 
Well, I still remember laughing 
With our backs against the wall 
So free of fear, we never thought 
That one of us might fall 

I sit before my only candle, 
But it's so little light to find my way 
Now this story unfolds before my candle 
Which is shorter every hour 
As it reaches for the day 
But I feel just like a candle in the way 
I guess I'll get there, but 
I wouldn't say for sure 

When we parted we were laughing still, 
As our goodbyes were said 
And I never heard from him again 
As each our lives we led 
Except for once in someone else's 
Letter that I read 
Until I heard the sudden word 
That a friend of mine was dead 

I sit before my only candle, 
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way 
Now this journey appears before my candle 
As a song that's growing fainter 
The harder that I play 
But I fear before I end I'll fade away 
But I guess I'll get there, 
Though I wouldn't say for sure 

Though Adam was a friend of mine, 
I did not know him long 
And when I stood myself beside him, 
I never though I was as strong 
Still it seems he stopped his singing 
In the middle of his song 
Well I'm not the one to say I know, 
But I'm hoping he was wrong 

I'm holding out my only candle, 
Though it's so little light to find my way 
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle 
And it's shorter every hour 
As it reaches for the day 
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way 
I hope I'll get there, 
But I never pray",Song for Adam,2017

Gregg Bissonette,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
