The Smiths,"As merry as the days were long 
I was right and you were wrong 

Back at the old grey school 
I would win and you would lose 

But you've got everything now 
You've got everything now 
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life 
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life 

No, I've never had a job 
Because I've never wanted one 

I've seen you smile 
But I've never really heard you laugh 

So who is rich and who is poor? 
I cannot say...oh

You are your mother's only son 
And you're a desperate one 
Oh... 

But I don't want a lover 
I just want to be seen...oh...in the back of your car 

A friendship sadly lost? 
Well this is true...and yet, it's false 
Oh... 

But did I ever tell you, by the way? 
I never did like your face 

But you've got everything now 
You've got everything now 
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life 
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life 

No, I've never had a job 
Because I'm too shy 

I've seen you smile 
But I've never really heard you laugh 

So who is rich and who is poor ? 
I cannot say...oh

Oh... 
You are your mother's only son 
And you're a desperate one 
Oh... 

But I don't want a lover

The Smiths,"Please don't cry 
For the ghost and the storm outside 
Will not invade this sacred shrine 
Nor infiltrate your mind 
My life down I shall lie 
If the bogey-man should try 
To play tricks on your sacred mind 
To tease, torment, and tantalize 
Wavering shadows loom 
A piano plays in an empty room 
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight 
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright 
I'll still be by your side 
For you are all that matters 
And I'll love you to till the day I die 
There never need be longing in your eyes 
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine 
Ceiling shadows shimmy by 
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey 
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes 
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes 
My life down I shall lie 
Should restless spirits try 
To play tricks on your sacred mind 
I once had a child, and it saved my life 
And I never even asked his name 
I just looked into his wondrous eyes 
And said : ""never never never again"" 
And all too soon I did return 
Just like a moth to a flame 
So rattle my bones all over the stones 
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns 
Oh, see how words as old as sin 
Fit me like a glove 
I'm here and here I'll stay 
Together we lie, together we pray 
There never need be longing in your eyes 
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine 
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine 
Mine 
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy 
Although you're only three, sonny boy 
You're - you're mine 
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother... 
As long...as long...as long 
I did my best for her 
I did my best for her 
As long...as long...as long as...as long 
I did my best for her 
I did my best for her

Bought on stolen wine

The Smiths,"Upon the sand, upon the bay
""There is a quick and easy way"" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state
I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves

End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say ""give in to lust
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust""
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
(Oh, really?)

I could have been wild and I could have been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(And well, it would)
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood

Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves, and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
It seems so unfair
I want to cry

You say : ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well, and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose/poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say : ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(Some dizzy whore, 1804)

Who comes sliding down the bannister ?

With a head full of plaster
Said : ""My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned""

As natural as rain

You had no real way of knowing
In my heart I begged, ""Take me with you
I don't care where you're going""

I was fawning, I was boring
Just a child from those ugly new houses

What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm

I danced my legs down to the knees

Will never meet again

To appear on the front of the daily mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?""

I was shocked into shame to discover
I am this 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or another

Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?

Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I never even knew what drugs were

I said, ""That's nothing, you should hear me play piano""

There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the dark nest of strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life

It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Though the storm and its fury breaks today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

Let us treat with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or clear
Let us trust in our Savior old ways
He will keep us everyone in His care

Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life

It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

The Smothers Brothers,"The very day I purchased it
I christened my guitar
As my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra
In my room I'd practice late
They'd leave me alone
My mother said, ""You're nothing yet
To make the folks write home""

I'd play at all the talent nights
I'd finish, they'd applaud
Some called it muffled laughter
I just figured they were odd
So I went up for an encore
But they screamed they'd had enough
Or maybe I just need a group
To help me do my stuff

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time
And way back in the distance
Some strings would sound so fine

And we would play together
Like fine musicians should
And it would sound like music
And the music would sound good
But in real life I'm stuck with
That same old formula

Oh, I write love songs for my favorite girl
And sing them soft and slow
But before I get to finish
She says she has to go
She's nice and says ""Excuse me
I've got to find a bar
I think I need refreshment
For I hear you play guitar""

Oh I sent a demo tape I made
To the record companies
Two came back address unknown
One came back C.O.D

All saying pleasant things
Like suggesting I should find a trade
Where I would not have to sing

But my teacher just took leave
It was something about a break down
Or needing a reprieve
I know I found my future
So I will persevere
And hold onto my dream of
Making music to their ears

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in

You're living with the bad

But the latter seems to be more
Than it ever has before
And in between the sorrow of self-infliction
And your blood cells are burning to break free

You know it's hot and we can't take it

But the trick is holding on
And the time is making everything seem hotter
And there's no use holding on

And every day is more like science fiction(?)

I flip 'til I can breathe

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

You are a river running through the desert plain
You are my shelter, from the pouring rain
You were my comfort, even before the pain

The leaves blowing in the breeze, ring out like guitars
A tin can rolls across the gravel like a tambourine
I am but a vessel, so I sing, because you are

In my head, you're always in my head
In my dreams, you're always in my head
In my pain, you're always in my head
In my peace, you're always in my head

An airplane in the distance, plays a beautiful cello line
It's no coincidence; it's in tune with the music in my head
If you were a shoulder you're where I would rest, but I am your vessel so I hear, you

Never planned on college I dropped out as a student
My GPA started with a decimal like Dewy
That’s lower than low, that’s lower than most
But if you thought I wouldn’t make it, you slower than slow
I make the type of music that stoners should know
If I plant one of my thoughts marijuana would grow
And I be high enough to go where I wanted to go (Reefer)

I was dropping fifties man to look like 50
Rocking pink Polo's, shit ain't even fit me
Looking for the inspiration that's already in me

He would spend it on the girls
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old hennaed curls

What did you get for me?""

She's a busted valentine

That her man is darned unkind

He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay

Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers

He got mixed up with a Flo

Today there is no black or white,

Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate,
The foolish from the wise.

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,

When to keep and when to share.
How much to protect your heart
And how much to care.

Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,

As he swings back and forward in the saddle

Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Where the shadows have all the room
I was ridin' free on the old SP
Humming a southern tune

When a man came along made me hush my song
Kicked me off, way out there
As she pulled out of sight I turned to the right
A left and everywhere

But all I could see was a cactus tree
And a prairie dog playing there
I watched the prairie dog feed on the tumbleweed
That's his home, way out there

So I threw down my load in the desert road
Rested my weary legs too
I watched the sinking sun, make the tall shadows run
Out across that barren plain

Then I hummed a tune to the risin' moon
He gets lonesome way out there
So I closed my eyes to the starlit skies
And lost myself in dreams

Then I awoke with a start
There the train comin' back on that one way track

The Soul Searchers,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

The Sound of Animals Fighting,"New music
New listening
Not an attempt to understand something
That is said
For if something were being said
The sounds would be given the shapes of words
Just an attention to the activity of sound
New means change the method
New means change the experience
And new experiences change man
Whenever we hear sounds we are changed
We are no longer the same
After hearing certain sounds
And this is more the case
When we hear organized sounds
Sounds organized by another human being
Music
Our entire system of values
Of the things we accept to be true
Is based on the visual sounds
You have to sign a paper because your word is not enough to be trusted
As a result the acoustic faculty in human beings has declined
As it has become possible to define a continuum between sounds and noises
Completely new problems have come up when we compose or play intuitively
Because we have no training whatsoever in balancing tones and noises
Traditionally in western music
Noises have been taboo
And there are precise reasons for this

Traditionally in western music
Noises have been taboo
And there are precise reasons for this
It began from the time when staff notations were introduced
And music could be noted in precise intervals for the first time
Then it was mainly vocal music
Some predominantly with vowels rather than consonants
If I sing a melody of consonants now, people would say it isn't music
We have no tradition of music composed in these sounds
And no notation for it
There you see how narrow our concept of music is
From having excluded consonants the noises
Of course you find consonants in vocals music
But only in order to make a word comprehensible
That's the function of a consonant in our daily language
To clarify the meaning
But in a musical sense
Consonants have no function other than as accents
S s or t or k
To start or end sound clearly
I respond to sounds directly
Sound is my air

They respond very well to me

You might think you know me, but it's all just a face
Trying to ignore when people screaming my name

There's a sign, an invitation from the woman inside
Talk about your boyfriend, talk about your wife
It's just a different way of living your life

When something's right, then something is worth to die for
When I feel that something is wrong, then something is worth to fight for

Don't say goodbye, just leave an open door
I wanna hear you say, you give me something to die for

Searching for another reason to stay

To make you feel alive

Your dreams and all your hopes

The Soundtrack of Our Lives,"I see the world with different eyes
Loud and clear I hold my view
I see no reason yet to give up
The sweat idea of my utopia

Lately I´ve found myself
Drowning in coffee and other habits
Told me to make a change
Told me to get a grip of things
Like just buy a paper to follow up
The rest of the world on the other side of my fence

I see the world...
I figured there´ll be someone
Waiting for someone else like me
Someone that needs a break
Needs to catch up with the real world
Maybe that someone and me could meet
Maybe together we could explore the other side

Can you hear the melody
Can you hear the world is calling us
I have always lived like this
Turned inside myself in my utopia
Oh my utopia

I see the world...",Utopia,2009

I had a funny dream
You were wearing funny shoes
You were going to a dance
You were dressed like a punk but you are too young to remember

Glad to see you
I'm outside the house
I'm not thinking well today
I've got no energy
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
Tell me all about your day

Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been

I'm happy for you
You've made it hard for me
I counted on your company
You are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I keep taking everything to be a sign

I'm happy for you
Now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled
I'm sitting on my empty bed
On my empty bed
At night the fever grows it's pounding pounding

I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
Watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo

Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes
My trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed
And I was home in bed
I was a kid again

Jesus told me, go after every coin like it was the last in the world
And protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep
I know I need My Shepherd here tonight

Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been

I'd like to see you
But really I should stay away
And let you settle down
I've got no claims to your crown
I was the boss of you
And I loved you
You know I loved you
It's all over now

I was there for you
When you were lonely
I was there when you were sad
I was there when you were bad
Now it's my time of need
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side?

And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm

Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild

It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn

They gave him everything he's got
And now he's keeping to himself, so send someone for your revenge?
Well maybe not revenge
It's been suggested that you're out to finish up your daddy's war
You say it's not okay for them to have enough to wipe us out, so why is it okay for you?
It seems to me that since no one's got their hands on anyone for what happened last year
You're using this as a distraction

It's better that you work this out yourself
I know you won't miss kids like us, but kids like yours will pay the price

It feels like the hoping and waiting will bring on a heart attack

She crossed her fingers in hopes it will bring him back home at last
She's back on the phone, but they say there's too much of a waiting list
He's left you behind and alone

Everyone's had a day like yours,
But you should know that you're not alone,
'Cause we'll be there with you always,
Call us up. Let's go!

I know when I go low,
I know where I can go,
Find those who help me,
And I find out why so,
I know it's hard to know
Exactly where to go
I find my way so no one else
Can feel left out (?)

[Chorus]
And when you feel let down
No one wants to be around
It's alright, we'll stay by your side.
And we'll get through it together

Some days are dark, I know.
That's why I think it's important to
Surround ourselves with friends who stay close
Feel stronger are along
Go on you always know that
If you need help I'll be there tomorrow.

I know you're feelin' down
No one wants to be around,
It's alright, we'll stay by your side.
And we'll get through it together.

To pick me up when I fall down,
Keep my feet safe on the ground [x3])

But I could never run.

To silence that confusion. 
And the pain and the illusion, 
Will dissapear again,

'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this years been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's still the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left
From last year, ski shopping, counter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 past along those lines

So deck those halls and trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back to spring time, sun again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course till summer time
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him
No, this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page and of course I am excited
Tonight's the night, I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos, a few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot
Oh darn, guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear?
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
I'm spending this one alone he said
Give me a break, this years been crazy
I said me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale to a very happy ending

And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven (Shure They Call It Ireland) [*],2008

And when she doesn't come home you have to sleep alone
Then you wet your bed, and I think that's sad
For a girl of nineteen it's more than sad
It's obscene

One, two

And your girlfriend sweet little seventeen
She's got her layered hair, and her flared jeans
You know what that means?
She's just a little queen
She shares your London flat
She thinks that London's where it's at
Although it stinks and when it rains, you wear your hat
And your plum coloured PVC wet-look maxi-mac
You tie your ginger hair back in a bun
You're the ugliest creature
Under the sun

One, two, go

One, two
And you think it's about time that you died
And I agree, so you decide on suicide
You tried but you never quite carried it off
You only wanted to die in order to show off
And if you think you're gonna bleed all over me
You're even wronger than you'd normally be
And the only things you want to see are kitsch
The only thing you want to be is rich
Your little pink up-pointed nose begins to twitch
I know, you know, you're just a little bitch

I don't like life when things get dull

And freed themselves from drunken stags

A circle round their leather bags
