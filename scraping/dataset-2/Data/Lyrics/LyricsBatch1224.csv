Travis,"You think
I don't know
I swear
That I do
This time
On my hands

I've had all this time
And I got a kick out of you
Now I'm falling down
And I'm felling sick how 'bout you
Oh I'm falling

But you seem
Out of sorts
But I know
We'll be fine
These chances
We take
Time wastes
So much time

But I can't stand anymore
Without falling down
And I'm getting used to the floor
Forever falling

And I got a kick out of you
Now I'm falling down
And I'm feeling sick how 'bout you
Oh I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling",Falling Down,1997
Travis,"A funny thing to do
Is everyone like you
'cause people seldom change
They all just stay the same

A funny thing to say
Suppose you're just that way
Although you're sure you're sure
There really is no cure

A funny kind of way
A funny kind of day
You're funny all the time
Do you want a piece of mine
'cause I've seen it all before
When you're closing all the doors

It's not funny anymore
A funny thing to do
Because the sky was blue
You ran away for good
'cause no one understood

The funny things you said
Because the sky was red
It all went to your head
Because the sky was red

A funny kind of way
A funny kind of day
You're funny all the time
Do you want a piece of mine
'cause I've seen it all before
When you're closing all the doors
It's not funny anymore

A funny thing to do
Is everyone like you
'cause people seldom change
They all just stay the same",Funny Thing,1997
Travis,"Where is your mother,
Where is your father,
Two little children,
Locked in the cupboard,
Into the wide world,
High on the high wire

What would you give to fly away,
Away, away, away, away,
Girl with the flower,
Boy with the hammer,
Lost in a forest,
On another planet,
Find me the exit,
Find them the way home

Find all the love they took away,
Away, away, away, away,
'Cause your head is a brick wall,
And your heart is a football,
And your eyes broken windows,
When you cry,
It's a good day to die

And your head is a brick wall,
And your heart is a football,
And your eyes broken windows,
When you cry it's a good day

'Cause your head is a brick wall,
And your heart is a football,
And your eyes,
It's a good day to die,
To die,
To die,
To die",Good Day to Die,1997
Travis,"I've got a good feeling
Like I know how I'm feeling
Scraping me off the ceiling
Back to that good feeling
Now I find it hard living
Wasting our time giving
When will we all give in
Into that good feeling
Now I got a good feelin'
Like I know how I'm feelin'
Scrappin' me off the ceiling
Back to that good feeling

You picked a time a very fine time
To look at me you'd see that I was fine
You're happy too just towing on your line
But you're afraid of what you'll find behind

In twenty years from now I'll be the same
And you'll be changing all the letters
In your maiden name
Ah you're thikin' that we're one
But we'll never be the same

'cause I got a good feeling
That I know I'm not missing
Anything you're giving
Isn't worth this good feeling",Good Feeling,1997
Travis,"It starts in the morning
When you're lying next to me
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling so quickly
Now I'm not a doctor
And I'm not a lawyer
I get a prescription and set it on fire
Blow me a kiss
I'll be happy for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
Oh, oh, aw
And I'm so happy

And I really shouldn't like it
But I love it
When I say I'm not excited
You're invited
And I think I'm getting older
There's this weight across ma shoulder
Its a shame we're the same
Such a shame I'm to blame all the time

But early this evening
I wanted to be with you
I got on the blower
The next thing I know you're speaking
Now I'm gonna tell you what I've been thinking
And I've got a hunch that you're thinking the same thing and with some luck
We'll be lying together tonight

[Chorus]

Oh oh ah
Oh oh ah
Oh oh ah
And I'm so happy",Happy,1997
Travis,"You were on my mind
Inside the cinema,
You looked so beautiful
I almost had to go;
And when I got outside
I thought of you again,
I think you should be framed
In some fine art gallery.

I know you'd disagree with me
But I love you anyways.

And should I climb high
My dreary city walls,
They make me feel so small
Oh,let me fade away.

This city's so cold and old,
Forever rain or snow,
I'd really love to come and go
Oh,won't you go stay with me.

I know you'd disagree with me
But I love you anyways.

You were on my mind 
Inside the cinema,
You looked so beautiful,
I almost dried an eye
And when I got outside
I caught the 44
It dropped me outside my front door
Forgot what I'd been living for.

Sergio Rogel.",I Love You Anyways,1997
Travis,"Look at me I'm so disgusting
I will never find another
Quite like you
You make me blue
With the things you do

Look at you you're so familiar
We could be so cool together
All the time
Could all be fine

We're on the line
The line is fine
Open up ma window
The line is fine

Standing on the ledge
Well I don't look down
Looking at the people
Well they all look fine

It's not just life or death
Yesterday we talked together
But tonight it's just the weather
Chillin' me

What's the point in silly talking
We could get there quicker walking
Down the line
Could all be fine
But we're on the line
The line is fine

Open up the window
The line is fine
Standing on the ledge
Well I don't look down
Looking at the people
Well they all look fine

But staring at the faces
Standing in a row
Thinking of all the places
That they have yet to go
they don't know

Open up the window
The line is fine
Standing on the ledge
Well I don't look down
Looking at the people
Well they all look fine
It's not just life or death
The line is fine
It's not just life or death
The worst line is mine

The line is fine

Travis,"More than us
And we are them
But they don't know
What's in their hands
It's more than you
And it's more than
I but it's more
And everybody calls it love
But I'm not really sure if it's love
At all

Not anymore
More than he
More than she
They all sleep
But we just dream
More or less
Means more for us
But it's more
And everybody wants a hand
But I'm too busy holding up the world
To carry on

No not anymore
I wish that I
Could fly fly fly away
And if I should fall
And you hear me call
Would you stay
More than us
And we are them

But they don't know
What's in our heads
It's more than you

Travis,"We're tied to the 90's
In the middle
I'm terribly frightened
I'm takin' it fast
Takin' it slow
There's thunder and lightning
It's terribly frightening
Lord knows
Where it goes
But I know
That if so
Well I want to tell you
We're tired of the 90's
We're tired of the 90's
But we're tied to the 90's
Tied to the 90's

Remember the 80's?
(they were something)
Were worse than the 90's
We're stuck in a path
Where fashion is fast
And nothin' is lasting
Its all ghetto blasting
And Lord knows
Where it goes
But I know
That if so well I want to tell you
We're tired of the 90's
We're tired of the 90's
But we're tied to the 90's
Tied to the 90's

Ah oh no
It's nothing to go on
The hifi five alive
That's it I'm stayin' in bed
'til my hair falls out
Everything's over
That said I like my wig
And I hate myself
I know its all in my head
We're tired of the 90's (x3)
But we're tied to the 90's
Oh we're tied to the 90's
We're tied to the 90's

Travis,"I met a girl in L.A
The million dollar kind
She was all for all or nothing
She was open all the time

But when I called her number
Her mother's on the line sayin'
You've no business
As god's my witness

With a child as young as mine
So make sure that she's old enough
Before you blow your mind
She may look like she knows enough

But look in her eye
And if so
Let her go
You'll let her down in style

I met a girl in paris
She talked like vera lynn
And her eyes were full of dew drop
The moment I walked in

She was awfully nice
The kind that likes to win
But if I'd been wiser
A whole lot wiser

Then I might have thought again",U 16 Girls (New Recording),1997

Travis,"Everyday I wake up alone
I'm not like the other boys
And ever since I was young
I had no choice

But it's OK to lead me on
I admit it's not much fun
To be led on by such a one
As you are
As you are
As you are

And ever since I woke up I felt the net
Was lifting me out of the sea
And even when I'm sinking I feel the need

But it's OK to lead me on
I admit it's not much fun
To be led on by such a one
As you are

As you are

And ever since a long time
I felt the rain
And there was no danger
And no more strangers
As you are",As You Are,1999
Travis,"Everything is open
Nothing is set in stone
Rivers turn to ocean
Oceans tide you home
Home is where your heart is
But your heart had to roam
Drifting over bridges
Never to return
Watching bridges burn

You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces
Just driftwood hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you

Nobody is an island
Everyone has to go
Pillars turn to butter
Butterflying low
Low is where your heart is
But your heart has to grow
Drifting under bridges
Never with the flow

And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long long time

Everywhere there's trouble
Nowhere's safe to go
Pushes turn to shovel's
Shoveling the snow
Frozen you have chosen
The path you wish to go
Drifting now forever
And forever more
Until you reach your shore

You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces
Just driftwood hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you
And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line

So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long long time
You've been drifting for a long long time
You've been drifting for a long long
Drifting for a long long time",Driftwood,1999
Travis,"All I wanted was the chance to say
I would like to see you in the morning

Closer every year
So near

My dear
The fear is here

Hottest summer in a hundred years

And she wore a black mustache
And pilfered all the petty cash
She went to Birmingham

And while the cats were all sniffing glue
They played their silly games

But there are many seasons to feel glad, sad, mad
It's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold
But I am here to help you with the load

It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same

You are one in a million

So now we're here and now is fine
So far away from there and there is time, time, time
To plant new seeds and watch them grow
So there'll be flowers in the window when we go

You won't tell a soul
Will you hold it and
Keep it alive

Cause it's burning a hole
And I can't get to sleep
And I can't live alone
In this lie

Don't look down

If the world isn't turning

So take me, don't leave me
Take me, don't leave me
Baby, love will come through
It's just waiting for you

And you stand at the crossroads
Of highroads and low roads
And I've got a feeling
It's right

If it's real what I'm feeling
There's no make believing
The sound of the wings
Of the flight

Of a dove, take it away

Saturday evening at a quarter to five
I would see him arrive at the door
Pushed you aside as he staggered inside

And you hide in your room
Thinking how you could settle the score

And you're live in the sticks

Still they never call you

Brought the neighbours all out on the street
They watched as the firemen carried you out

And they stared at each other's feet

How we're all just afraid of the heat
But

And I'm lying alone in the bed that I made
Disconnected the phone

I lived in a little town
Where little dreams were broken
And words were seldom spoken

I tried to reach you

On this little town

The little people
Had very little left to say
Their words had all been shortened
It didn't really seem important

And I had a feeling
That you were very far away
But then a little voice inside me said
""you'll never get away from here""

And it's 1, 2,
3 Times and you lose
Of course it doesn't matter how you say it
I'm all out of luck
So there's nothing really more to say
I'm throwing it all away

Well we had opinions
But now we all think the same
We never look at one another
Only when the other suffers

And I thought I saw you
But it was just another face
Plastered on a blank horizon
Running in the human race

And it's 1, 2,

Battleship down

When will you figure it out that it's not worth the fight little darlin'

Knocking over hurdles

Inside the cinema,
You looked so beautiful

I thought of you again,
I think you should be framed
In some fine art gallery.

But I love you anyways.

And should I climb high
My dreary city walls,
They make me feel so small
Oh,let me fade away.

Forever rain or snow,
I'd really love to come and go
Oh,won't you go stay with me.

"Travis ""Schleprok"" McCoy","I had a nightmare
I lived in a little town
Where little dreams were broken
And words were seldom spoken

I tried to reach you
But all the lines were down
And so the rain began to fall
On this little town
... On this little town

The little people
Had very little left to say
Their words had all been shortened
It didn't really seem important

And I had a feeling
That you were very far away
But then a little voice inside me said
""you'll never get away from here""

And it's 1, 2,
3 Times and you lose
Of course it doesn't matter how you say it
I'm all out of luck
So there's nothing really more to say
I'm throwing it all away

Well we had opinions
But now we all think the same
We never look at one another
Only when the other suffers

And I thought I saw you
But it was just another face
Plastered on a blank horizon
Running in the human race

And it's 1, 2,
3 Times and you lose
Of course it doesn't matter how you say it
I'm all out of luck
So there's nothing really more to say
I'm throwing it all away

And it's 1, 2,

When will you carry me home take it back to the start when you knew me

We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never
Overboard, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late

When will you figure it out that it's not worth the fight little darlin'

I get a move, I got to get myself to clean my shoes
And take the cynic route
I was afar, I’m following the star
Home isn’t where you are

And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until we’re gone, we’re moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on

And where the birds don’t fly
And if the night is coming pretty soon
I’m walking through the dark with you
I’ve got to play
I’ve got to listen to my toy today
On the motorway
And I could feel, the ground beneath my wheels,
Putting me back in my place

And everything is falling into place

Take the avenue way
And I know exactly where to go
Home isn’t where you stay

And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until we’re gone, we’re moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on

I feel alive, I am aware of the colors in the sky
Where the birds don’t fly
And if the night is coming ṗretty soon
I’m walking through the dark with you",Moving,2013
Travis Barker,"Its the Humpty dump truck big wheel wall crumbler
If money did talk yours probably be a mumbler
The bumble bee color Kush burning in the bubbler puff
Brother rocks Dougie but its uglier on that other stuff 
I'm saying no weighing only about 175
I sound like a heavier guy but we high so high-five
Behinds and nice thighs and the sun beamin' flicking on the old blue beamers hoodie
And Woody Allen couldn't see it with his glasses on
At homecoming getting drunker then the chaperon
And don't you hate when you go into a place and somebody need a i.d.
Cause they left it at home you feel bad if you go ahead and leave 'em so you
Try to swap it out and hope the door man believe 'em

Supposed to be flexed on your niggas last summer chill

Maybe it's how I write shit when I'm in the zone,

I just wanna perform at the biggest place in the World cause I'm dope like them four packs
Sitting in, writes on my window sill
Making sure everything stays on chill
? wearing all white ? Sayin' pay yo bills
So that raw metaphor that I thought of before
I don't remember no more cause I just ran out the door to meet a fiend by the store
And I heard 'so you off touring?'
I turn and seen his whore that I used to fiend for that aint never let me score
Looking at me like I'm something she aint never ever saw

Just wicked wispers of scriptures, satan is narrating
I heard you got a safe in your crib so I'm there waiting
Nobody safe in your crib, when I'm in that staircase I'm bare-faced
Possessed by what you possess, I'm hell raising
And I just left somebody's father a quadriplegic
Told em not to move or get shot to Egypt
He did not believe it
He's losing blood and I'm cold blooded like I'm anemic

Your boy's going big these days, didn't even see?

You can't take my God from inside of me
Crosses up, light up the sky with me
I got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
Like what's the real reason that the pope resigned?
I got Van Halen, I don't need a bassline
I knew we can do it, it was just a matter of time
Put the axels back on the street and break on the vine

The world is a steak, I'm a chew it up raw
We're back in heavy metal like we above the law
London, Japan, Germany and France
Lisbon to New York, we're live up in Netherlands
Jump up on some shoulders baby, you never dance
You only live once, come on, here's your chance
You could be reborn, half star, half man

I mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within,
The word ""distraught"" cannot describe how my heart has been,
But where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?

I held the funeral the day you left,
A black umbrella and a sad song in my head,
Buried your pictures that I loved the most,
‘Cause if you survived me I just didn’t wanna know,
So you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited,
No you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because,

I never thought that you and I would ever meet again,
I mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within,
The word ""distraught"" cannot describe how my heart has been,
But where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?

I’m so confused I don’t know what to feel,
Should I throw my arms around you or kill you for real?
‘Cause I worked so hard to put the past to rest,
Now it’s tumbling down on me just like an avalanche,
So you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited,
No you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because,

I know I know I can sit and talk but I can’t make you listen,
You wish that I paid attention, I thought if I paid admissions,
To wherever, go however, it would paint the perfect picture,
You said ""no matter how much you f*cking make it doesn’t make a difference"",
And I’m so so so sorry that we fell in love, Geronimo, it’s Like One thing leads to another,

Swear we’re fucking we’re dominos but, here we are,
Now I’m trying to find an answer in this Bottle girl,
And I’m im driving slow, driving slow, don’t let the piranha’s know

But you gon’ miss me when I’m gone,
Why we gotta wait that long?
Baby do-do-do-do-don’t,
Or should I walk out instead,
Is this live and let die or night of the living dead?

I never thought that you and I would ever meet again,
I mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within,

Thought you got away with murder

'Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch

I'm okay now, bring the napalm
I'll fly over and blow you away
No more sunshine, no more playgrounds
I'll fly over and blow you away now

When I fly over, and blow you away
Blow you away now

I just wanted to live my life like the common man
Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends
Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right
Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights
And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all
Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn
I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Average for an arsonist, tagging up the apocalypse
The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite
All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments
The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious
This is for the populous, population genocide
Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize
Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise
When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind
But hey, hey

Trained to trainicle auberate with authority

Denying that they fighting for the their lives, 
Every night to survive since the beginning of time
Cant believe the evil that feeds off this so called American dream
Lies in the seat make all the Americans seem like blood-sucking money hungry fiends
But money doesn't mean
A damn thing to me
I just want to be
I want to be free
But unfortunately a fortune is what you need
Cause the fortune 500s run the country
Its one company
If your not a company
Would you mind grabbing me a cup of tea?
If we go hungry, in our own country
I wonder whats its like living in Hungry
Yeah, it isn't funny, but its coming
Its about to get ugly
Streets turn to a game of rugby

We're buying bubbly and making rate 100s
Is it just me or is that some dumb shit
Yo what the fuck
Hoe comes

Lets go

Donate your dollars
Raise a dollar
Help a mother

And it ain't gonna stop with Obama

Everything I'm talkin' real, I ain't make it up

And shake and then fall and break with that bottom bass
Make you wanna tear the club up and go tattoo your face

Got a lock in the pocket, a rock in the sock
With a cop I'm a nervous wreck
I never could keep a job 'cause I rob and I take
And I leave you with nothing left, but mama tried
Mama tried to harvest early and the pot died
If she ever said I was a good boy
Trust me, mama lied
Leave these haters with a cane to walk
Take these lames with a grain of salt

From Alabama to Atlanta from Atlanta 
I began to build a plan, a panoramic view
To center who my friends, the men around me was the culture is that slum, uh

This I know, because Nas told me so
Damn right, so give me that bag of money real quick let's go
I've got it cranked, it's parked out front
I'm a wanted man and I'm on the run

Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

Why did those days ever have to go

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

Travis Collins,"Wake up, Maggie,
I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,2005

One by one my fears fade into blue
Wherever You are taking me is where I need to be
And You have Your reasons, who am I to say no

When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you wonder what went wrong

(First I get that slap top) turn her to her backside

That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy real good, I beat it real good.

Me, I’m from the East side, say she from the South side
I don't like to drive much, told her visit my side
Had to switch off my location, my house is her destination
Say she ain't have no fuckin' ride, so I picked her up from the mall station
Damn she got that Fiji pussy, I'm a dope fiend I need the pussy
Every other day I feed the pussy, never ever ever ever will I eat the pussy
Your hoe is my hoe, 
You can’t go ?
Disrespect or cross the line, niggas I dull her
Light skinned, long hair or short hair, I don’t care
The grocery store, studio, everywhere I go, there's hoes there
Chillin’ in my ride with my bitch on the side 
Stop talking, suck somethin', you’re fucking up the vibe

I’ve been fucking all night, I got a hangover
I am so fly, I need a lay over
I dove in, take your bitch and I walk out

You fuck with me, I don’t fuck with you
Ferrari coupe, hot pursuit, 
Pop and learn and I’m popping too
As far as chains I'm rocking two
Jewelery store I'm copping two
That’s one for me, one for me, don’t run for me
Luckily, no ?
Bunch of weed and a bunch of lean
True religion, bunch of jeans
Gucci store, bunch of G's
Turn a hair weave into a murder scene
And I do what I gotta do when I gotta do
When she with me she won’t answer phones
I do make her cum too, make her some through, with no bra and no panties on

That pussy good, that pussy moist, twenty-two, she from Detroit
I beat it up, beat it up, in the mirror you can see yourself
First I get that head game, then her girlfriend eat it up.
Got a white girl that snort cocaine, me I just stay weeded up
Fo' girls at one time, I'm a pimp boy
She out of sight, she out of mind, R-I-P to ?
Face down, ass up, a nigga gotta get his cash up
He talked to ?, my diamond come from Alaska
All these hoes wanna smash us, we bossed up so we tossed 'em up
Heard you chumps dropped five hundred, nigga it ain't no cost for us

I just got me a text message on my iPhone, said I'm coming over
Yeah girl, that's cool 'n all, but you gotta bring me a box of rubbers
How many you need? Like one or two, mother of fact, two are good
I'ma use any last one, 'cause that pussy is too good,
Yeah, I ain’t none of them other niggas, 
Yeah, I’m way above them niggas
She make them niggas drop a cup of jizz
Me and my niggas been escape for free.

Halle Berry sequel made me feel good, 
I said okay girl that pussy real good

OK, I gotta come and say what up?
Make sure they heard my own right
First I get my dick suck then heading for a back ride
Turn on to her back side, then I put that pimpin' riddle

All black with some gold on
Forgiato's on the whip, get my roll on
Bad yellow bone bitch, ain’t got no clothes on ‘er
Four door Jeep, bitch ain’t got no doors on ‘er
Pop a rubber band, bitch I do this every night
Go out Friday night, early morning catch a flight
But turn the lights off, baby welcome to the show
If you ain’t down to play your role bitch you gotta go
If you don’t wanna go, then baby take a shot
I know you want these rubber bands, drop it like it’s hot
Yea, I turned a flip into a movie set
And when she see rubber bands it get her pussy wet

[Chorus]

Look, shawty wanna shake that ass on me
I said cool, man I’m glad I got some cash on me
Young nigga 21, I’m a fucking boss
All this money that I throw 'em coulda bought a loft
And y’all niggas can’t afford those
No he doin' bad, his crib foreclosed
Yea, and I ain’t nothing like that other man
Still looking polished with the hotties poppin' rubber bands
Spending money all across the world
Up the magic closet, have it with my nigga Earl
Yea, pulled up in the new Range
No, we had to make it rain with the loose change

I can't believe, what I'm hearing myself say
And a porch light is my spotlight, so I play along with this lie
That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye

Did you even notice, the whole word shatter?
I just want to hold you, and tell you that I'm sorry
But I just keep it all inside

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

To me, that's where the fiddlin' begins.

Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away,
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow,
And he knew it was time for him to go.

I know I'll find you but girl 'til I do
This is my love song for you

Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn
'Til you drift off to dream in my arms

You might be hundreds or more miles away
Or you might be just down the street

Help me understand where I went wrong

You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

What have I got to do to make it better
What have I got to do to make you see
That even though I promised you forever
I never knew how hard that would be

But I've learned that love worth having don't come free
And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you

Travis Tritt,"Bobby played his guitar on the harder side of town,
where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money.
He had dedication.
He had the heart and soul.
Somehow knew he was born to play.

People said, ""Get a real job, support your family,
'cause there's no future in the road you're takin'.""
He never said a word.  The dreamer just kept on.
Later at night you could hear him sing.

He said, ""I'm gonna be somebody.
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains.
I'm gonna be somebody someday.
You can bet your hard earned dollar I will.

The road was a struggle, it took him ten years to the top,
but now he's number one on the stage and the radio.
Still he can't believe how people come from miles around,
when it seemed like only yesterday,

He would say, ""I'm gonna be somebody.
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains.
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

To show you how I feel about you.  Mm hm.
'Cause there's no one else I swear holds a candle anywhere
Next to you.  Mm hm

In the church that I grew up in
She was looker from Atlanta, led the choir, played piano
Had a body that was made for sin
She didn't care that he was married, cause the torch that she carried
Was hotter than the fires of hell
She had plans to seduce him, if she could, she could loosen
A notch in the Bible Belt
So, she called him up at home when she knew he'd be alone Said, 'Preacher I could use advice,
I got troubles with a man that I know you'll understand
If you could help me it would sure be nice'
They met a few minutes after in the office of the Pastor
And she started telling how she felt
What a chance they were takin' when they first started breakin'

That believe what the good Book said
Well, I'll tell ya somethin' brother when you're dealin' with the Devil

And it's hard to imagine how the flames of passion
Can burn you till your soul will melt
And it'll spread like a cancer but you're gonna have to answer
To the Lord and the Bible Belt

To hear the news of what they did
Nobody could believe that he left his wife to grieve
Alone with two pre-school kids

Travis Tritt,"He was born in the big iron city
Deep in the heart of Dixie, yes he was now
Raised on the good Book
Taught to take a good look at what's going on
His daddy was Birmingham lawman
A servant of the people through and through
They say blood is thicker than water
So the boy got a badge and a suit of blue

He was long on southern justice
Practiced his law out on the street
Drew the line for the criminal mind to see
Dedicated to keep God's children free
 
There are two sides to every big city
And he walked on the side that wasn't pretty
A solitary ranger
He had to deal with the danger 'round every turn
Every day was a tightrope of decision
Between a forty-four and a heart of gold
Some of those hard case confrontations
Would cut him like a switch-blade to his soul
 
He was long on southern justice
Practiced his law out on the street
Drew the line for the criminal mind to see
Dedicated to keep God's children free
 
Late one night down on Crack Street Alley
He walked up on a bad deal goin' down
He knew what he'd done
When he saw that shotgun swing around
He drew then froze in hesitation
When he saw that fourteen year old face
Then the fire from that shotgun barrel
Blew all his burdens away
Blew his burdens away
 
He was long on southern justice
Practiced his law out on the street
Drew the line for the criminal mind to see
Dedicated to keep God's children free",Southern Justice,1994

I'm so glad you found me
Wrapped your sweet love around me
And helped me to make a new start
I was down on the bottom
Sad stories, Lord, I've got 'em
She was walkin' all over my heart

She was cheatin', she was lyin'
Alibis, I kept buyin'
It was tearin' my whole world apart
And like the fool she made of me
I kept thinkin' that she loved me
But she was walkin' all over my heart

Oh, today more than ever
I believe love's forever
And it's you who brought back that spark
So, I'm stickin' with our love
I was so sick and tired of
Her walkin' all over my heart

I fall down but somehow I always got back up
I've climbed every mountain, crossed every valley too
I had a heart without a home but I kept on keepin' on
Lookin' for a love that would be true
But they were all just steppin' stones to you

Well, I have walked on mines when I should have read the signs
Sayin', 'Dead end, don't rush in' but I did every time
An' I started believin' that I was born to lose, oh, don't know
Oh, but those days are gone 'cause the love that you have shown
Has given me another point of view

I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel, 
There was a guy 
Inventing a shark bite suit. 
There's only one way to test that. 
""Alright Jimmy, you got that shark suit on, 
It looks good
They want you to jump 
Into this pool of sharks, 
And you tell us if it hurts when they bite you."" 

""Well alright, hold my sign, I don't want to loose it""

Last time I was home I was driving around I had a flat tire, 
I pulled my truck into one 
Of these side-of-the-road gas stations, 
The attendant walks out, looks 
At my truck, looks at me, I swear to GOD he went, 
""Tire go flat?"" 

I couldn't resist. 
I said ""Nope"". 
""No I was driving around 
And those other three just swelled right up on me.""

We were trying to sell our car about a year ago, 
A guy come over to the house, drove the 
Car around for about 45 minutes. 
We get back to the house, he gets out 
Of the car, reaches down 
And grabs the exhaust pipe, then goes, ""Damn that's hot!""

If he'd been wearing his sign, I could have stopped him.",Here's Your Sign (Get the Picture) [Single Version],1997
Travis Tritt,"We were young and bound for glory
Itchin' for a fight like you
Bringin' hell and purgatory
To the boys who wore the blue
And I thought I'd seen it all
Till the day night wouldn't fall
Oh, how the sun did blaze
Wouldn't go down for days
I got shot and lost my rifle
When the first wave hit the rise
And the guns rolled out like thunder
And the black smoke burned my eyes
And I watched it all unfold
Just the way the Bible told
Joshua's endless day
Keepin' the night at bay
And the soldiers kept a comin'
Til the ground looked like a sea
Of blue and grey
And I watched it from a distance
Wonderin' if I would've fought or run away

The day the sun stood still
How they beat the bloody drums
And the seconds moved like hours
But the sunset never comes
And the cannons shake the ground
And the bullets test your will
Even shadows found no cover
On that Godforsaken hill
The day the sun stood still

And I watched them lean their shoulders
To the fearful hail of lead
And I prayed for night to save us
And I cried and bowed my head
Bt the sun just kept a-creepin'
'Cross a cold indifferent sky
Castin' a deadly glow
On all the men below
All the hours in a lifetime
Don't add up to one while minute in that sun
And the heroes and the cowards
Look the same when they have fallen by the gun
The day the sun stood still

And the north and south looked west
But the evening star was sleeping
And the daylight wouldn't rest
Out on the killing floor
The red sun on the the hill
Shinin' down on all the dead men
With a strange and eerie chill
The day the sun stood still

Do not judge what you brother does
Till you've walked a mile
Rank by bloody file
Who's to say if you'll run or stay and fight?

The day the sun stood still
Is just beneath the skin
In the soul of every soldier
Every battle that he's in
The day the sun stood still
Will haunt your dreams at night
And stalk your every sunrise
Though you will not know it till

The day the sun stood still
How they beat the bloody drums
And the seconds moved like hours
But the sunset never comes
And the cannons shake the ground
And the bullets test your will
Even shadows found no cover

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you,
For a while maybe longer if I do.

Don't you think the time is right for us to find,
That all the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time,
Can't you see which way we should turn together or alone,

Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way,
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray,
And can you see that I don't know if it's you or it's me,
But if it's one of us I'm sure we both will see, yeah,
Won't you look at me and tell me.

I'd almost given up 
On the hope of having someone of my own
But you came into my life
And you made this empty house into a home
I could never ask for more
And every day I'm thankful for you

The first time that I held you girl
I knew that it was real
And now I wake up every morning
Knowing what it's like to feel
So much love for you

As the years go passing by
There'll be lows and highs
That we'll go through
But I can close my eyes and rest
Cause come what may I'm blessed if I have you

High heel shoes, short skirt with her shoulders bare

Got a way of walkin' like a wild bobcat

She likes pickup trucks and longnecks and she loves to dance
She can steal your heart in a second with a single glance
Skin tight jeans and a cowboy hat
Hit a boy harder than a baseball bat
Well you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that

Well I wouldn't call myself a righteous man
But I thank heaven every chance I can
For sending Eve to Adam when this old world first began

Well I wouldn't call myself a righteous man
But I thank heaven every chance I can
For sending Eve to Adam when this old world first began

Natural born beauties turning heads everywhere they go
Take your breath away like a tire gone flat
Make a man cry like a little spoiled brat

Yes, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that
Well, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that

Travis Tritt,"There's been times I've felt like half a man
Life's had me down on my knees
Troubled times I don't understand why they happen to me
I have struggled through the darkness and I have found the light of day

[Chorus:]
But if I lost you, there'd be no sunshine shining through
I don't know what in the world I would do if I lost you

Growing wild as I got older I fulfilled what had been said
Hiding ignorance and fear I prayed nobody saw me bluffing
But I was laying the foundation for a future I would dread
Yeah

Seems like every choice I made would somehow leave me second-guessing
'Bout the green grass I was passing racing toward the other side
I thank God for the blessing
That I finally learned this lesson:
One Step in the right direction's worth a wasted mile behind

Singin'
No more lookin' over my shoulder
No more hangin' on to the past
No more filling up my tomorrows
With yesterday's sorrows
No more lookin' over my shoulder

I could chill a room with reasons why I would not give forgiveness
To the people who had selfishly left me a wounded soul
I kept dragging 'round those memories
Like a ball and chain behind me
Wonderin' why my troubles followed me wherever I would go
Oh, but one night, sick and tired of being sick and tired
I realized forgiveness was the only open road
I swear I heard those shackles snap
The moment that I took that path
I never have one time looked back since the morning I arose

I'm singin'
No more lookin' over my shoulder
No more hangin' on to the past
No more filling up my tomorrows
With yesterday's sorrows

I was wild eyed and crazy with a spirit that could not be tame 
I had no direction Lord knows that I've been lost a time or two
But Faith was there to guide me to lead me down the road to you
 
There've been other women but all they did was occupy my time
There was always something missing but until you I thought I'd never find
Thought I knew what I was looking for looking back I didn't have a clue
All the love that was waiting at the end of the road to you
It was worth the tears and the long and lonely years that I went through
I'd relive the pain for the happiness I've gained
In all the love that I've found in you
And when I hold you in my arms there's nothing else in the world I'd rather do
I just close my eyes and thank the Lord he led me down the road to you

Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
'Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

Woo...

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond

Never really thought about settling down
That is until, you came around
Yeah, it's been a few years but I remember it well
I was a rowdy no-gooder
You were hotter than hell
I spent all my time
Hot on your trail

You could've run through the mountains
Could've sailed across the deep blue sea
I knew from the start
Couldn't let you get away from me

Well your mama and your daddy
They didn't approve
They told you me was trash and I was born to lose
But that didn't faze me
I was gonna have you
So I begged and I pleaded
Something I'd never done
And sure as tomorrow has a rising sun
There was no mistake
Honey, you were the one

You could've run through the mountains 
Could've sailed across the deep blue sea
But one thing's for sure
You would never get away from me

The sweetest things in life take you by surprise
Like the heaven I see looking in your eyes
Though you weren't sure how an outlaw's love would be
I made up my mind not to let you get away from me (End of Bridge)

As we get a little closer to our rocking chairs 
I think back on the good times that we have shared
And how our love has grown
Down through the years
So snuggle up to me baby turn out the lights
There's no where on this earth I'd rather be tonight
Then lying in your arms
Holding you tight
As time roll's by one thing's still plain to see
I'd have been a fool to let you get away from me

To dance all night to the break of day.
When the caller would holler: ""Do Si Do"",
They knew Uncle Pen was ready to go.
Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

Well, he played an old tune they called the ""Soldier's Joy"",
And he played the one they called the ""Boston Boy"".
Greatest of all was the ""Jennie Lynn"",
To me, that's where the fiddlin' begins.

Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away,
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow,
And he knew it was time for him to go.

Have the teardrops stopped
No one's walking the floor
And the blues don't ever come around and knock on the door
No angry words are spoken
No hearts are being broken
Doesn't anyone hurt anymore

I'm not a lonely man locked away in a room
Crying for some lost love and cursing out the moon
But I know there's people out there that love has put to shame
Sometimes a song is all they have to help them through the pain

Watching out for drunks and babies and fools
And castaways like me

And come out as the sweet things you say
You stitch me back up when life plays too rough
Give my hand a little squeeze when we pray

And divide the pain bt two

I'm just a circus leaving town.

Once we could fill the room with laughter
And fill each other's hearts with joy
Through each trial and disaster
Still we cling to our choice.

To take a path so unforgiving
A road that waits for no one
You know we chose to keep on living
Lord, tell me where did we go wrong.

I guess you're tired of walking tightropes
Of setting up and tearing down
You want a place to call forever
And rest your feet on solid ground.

Don't try to break this spell I'm under
And stop these wheels from spinning around
I'm a storm in search of thunder
Yes, I'm just a circus leaving town.

Some day you'll wake up and wonder
And your heart will start to pound
And you'll long for the thunder
And the kiss is of a clown...",Circus Leaving Town,2004

Spent playing a telecaster, till my fingers bled bud light
I got this scar in a beer bar brawl
Outside of Tuscaloosa, stitched it up in a bathroom stall

And I got this tattoo in the back of a pool room in east Tennessee
Oh, I got a long honkey-tonk history
See this solid gold watch change hand
Took it off a Texas oil tycoon in a backwoods poker game

Look at these holes in my tailgate
Their from Suzy Johnson's husband's snub nose 38
Thank god he's a bad shot and I had that toolbox, between him and me

And wish for our future on a faraway star

Then I look  at what you've given me, I feel like dancing on my tip toes.

I must say everyday I pray
When realize you're by my side,
I know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
Blessed to make sure you never go.

There are times  that I test your faith, 'til you think you might surrender.
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say, that my hopes will grow in splendor

You walked by in the nick of time
looking like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
Blessed to make sure you never go.

Blessed with love and understanding,
Blessed when I hear you call my name,
Do my best with faith that's never-ending,
Blessed to make sure you feel the same.

Deep inside you fill me with your tender touch

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
To see you never go",Blessed,2000
Trax,"What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill
Come through, blow something, smoke something
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side
Letting y'all broads know, we too real

What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like
You don't know me
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a
Little bit lonely
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of
Your butt
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up
All your time
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on
You
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke
Marijuana
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers
Through your hair
Go to the Residence Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of
Underwear 
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so
Don't leave no scars
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have
Do a little wine and take a little bath
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you
Down
All you got to do is put me in the penn
Got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something 
Keep it on the low and we could do this today

[Chorus]
Let's chill, so I could knock you down
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do

OK, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump
In my ride
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside
With our minds, you got something that I cut for
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust
You
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls

Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the
Curb
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could
Receive
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight
Up and real
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife 
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on
Your mind
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to
Chill baby

[Chorus]

I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been
Captured 
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away
Together
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on
The lever
Get aqua tinted with each other as we feel the Mo City
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never
Show pity
But if you scared, I mean you not alone
It might be the ghetto but I call it home
90 percent of the killers are cool with me
So it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I
Was lying
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in
Between the thighs
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and
Then slow dance
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon
The stereo bumping our slow jam song
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it
On
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in
Your life
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your
Life

I didn't fall from heaven, I rose from hell
Bigboy, get bagged, he gon' hold my bail
It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage
12 shells ricocheting and it pours from the hemorrhage
Get the casket embalm and forget the bastard for moving backwards

All this nigga know is, get money burn a lot of smokes
Lazy niggas was sleeping, I was wide awoke
Not a joke, creep on snitches, niggas gotta choke
When it's time to sleep with the fishes I supply the boat
And I swear it hurts, I supply the coke
'cause don't nothing scare me worse than dying broke
Iron poking on my ribs while I'm laying in a Taurus
I live this shit y'all just performers, it's a dirty game
I seen thugs turn informers, crooked cops run in the crib, no warrants
Money talk though, never stuck in a grudge,
Got a female lawyer and she fucking the judge
I was once told, that you reap what you sow
And a, the scent of weed always seep in your clothes
And a, it's Quiet Money so we speaking in codes

Anybody can spit, faggot, but can you make a hot song?
You're not wrong, like Biggie said you're dead wrong
Need to get your flow tight, gotta get your head strong
Watch us, the way we floss up in coat lockers
Walk right past security, flippin' poppers
Like what? who the fuck gon' stop us?
y'all wait until the summer, when this fucking album drop us
I know y'all hate it, because y'all flows outdated
You finished as an artist and I finally made it
But I paid my dues, in this game patiently waited

It's A dot, all year 'round I stay hot

Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog [head up up] in my cup
[Put Rudolph and Moses] lil' bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}
Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}
Life is so crucial and cold, [it's worse] for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh
Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of ""I Saw Mama Kissing Santa""
Made you remenisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shout
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and Mom's private secret

Hard gangsta aim to represent til death 
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick 
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with 
The bare hand man sleeper 
I even banked up and shank motherf***ers in the *?penta?* 
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time 
so try me you're liable to lose on my line

Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business, racketeering
Smuggling, doing things from handing a gun,is what they fearing
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you show them my money, your ass is getting f-laid
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thing in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to taking them out!

[Daz]
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

[Tray Dee]
I had no choice or remorse for time for putting it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet making it pop
Young crook keeping hook, nigga, shaking the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself 'cause there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust, bust, be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cause the niggas that I dared to ""agank"" the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm hauling my heat I'm stalling
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listening
And war story glory ain't worth the risking
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set, till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee, nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm taking em out!

[Snoop Dogg]
I come through blasting, me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashing, may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone, Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the you-S-see, I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's, 87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die, till we burst and break
From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums   
We ran outta dope, I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example, what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself, me my dope, me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges, I budge when I buzz

In effect, see'mon
Ahh yeah, watch out, get ready for war
We the Gang and we bang knockin down your door

What's the secrets of war I can't take no more
Within minutes we get in it comin for you and yours
With these automatic toys throughout the world make noise
Dippin in low-lows, and jumpin out of fo'-do's

Catchin, many and any with the fo'-fo'
Blastin and mashin I cash in many for Death Row
Rest in peace to my homeboys who ain't alive
Now the mission is for us to conquer and ride

The worst California we droppin somethin on ya
Ain't no one to sound, like ta-pow, you a goner
For the simple fact we get Gang Related
We have the papers and you suckers hate it

What you gon do when we get loose and act a fool
Break the rules on you and dust you off with the tools

[Chorus: x2]
Yeah, you know I ain't nuttin but a gangsta
Only with the swoll rolls and the paper
Once I get the big bank, gotta shake her

With the Gangsta Boogie

I penetrate, send it straight to your middle brain
Three times dope similar to my nickname
A big Caine, ain't nuttin changed now I'm solo

My gangsta ass track with the Gang is my logo
Ridin with the top down, off lockdown
Time for me to knock down fool's whole compound
Like the World Trade Center
 
The world made thinner when I'm pullin on my girl gray trigger
Figure when I enter I intend to rule this
This industry fin to see I'm nuttin to fool wit
Like Jack Nicholson, I smack fickle men

And pack somethin in my penalty
Will well then they see the toppest servin a putdown
And I'm on this notice my opponents get took down
A crook down from my ground of clout

Representin Death Row when I was down and out
It don't stop

[Chorus]

[Daz Dillinger]
I came in the game with the aim to maim
The gangbang murder main slang is strange
My first idea when I stare up in the mirror

Is how Daz Dillinger gon creep up on the scrilla
And if I don't plot then I'll probably not
Get my issue, so I gotta figure how to twist you
Hit you hard like a gauge shot

Watchin fools laid out when the bloodshot sprayed out
I shoot my way out these punks for rent
So duck when the slugs hit your trunks, you're finished
I'm comin out runnin that's to shake the scene

Break the green I'll scream out the gangsta theme
Do or die! Ain't no lie, that's the way I eat
Watch me scope out and choke out the prayout beat
GIve me six in the chamber fuck twelve in the box

Let the gravedigger be the one shovelin rocks, it don't stop

Fancy cars and houes

Knowing where you motherfuckers rest and hang at
I'm in long beach, where the gang bangers hang at
Don't want more static, or panic, we're packing gats
And asking for shit, nigga, 'cause we're blasting
See, we're the gang, kicking just to maintain

Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight

Money busters lyrically in motion
About to whip a ? the east side coast and
I'm the one they love to hate with a passion
I packs a blue steel, filled with skilled raps, blast it
Mc's get dealt with, my microphone's my third partner
Heat seeking like a missile when I drop ya
Style is proper, my execution-style of rapping
I'm packing a rap while you say ""why, what's happening? ""

You couldn't see me with a crystal ball, y'all

Come out with your shit man, I'm broke, feeling critical conditions

Creeping to the night, beating tight, Armageddon

Battling motherfuckers till the break of dawn

Dat nigga daz will come out and play
Busting on niggas with an ak
So any given day you want some
Come and get some, you don't want none

Why do we bang?
Why do we bang for a living? we just don't know
Now it's time to serve y'all bitches ass niggas on an open platter
Yeah, ha ha

Fool, what nigga, you know that got your ass laying down?

You see, I take the ultimatum, disregard the outcome
I'm hard to outrun, and won't be outdone
I hate fake take away motherfuckers
I come up from the slums and I run, motherfuckers
No other than the gang, it's the slang and prosper
And bang us mobsters, while claiming oscars
While most niggas froze, they control their coast
They be home and broke, 'cause they've been known to choke
Like Malone, be gone when the playoffs come
But I'm a stay off one, liable to spray off some
Ammunition, I handle missions one on one
Niggas, come on, come and get their ? done
I'm the cannibal, the Hannibal lector of rap
A nigga steps up wack, and gets a setup-tax
We're the gang, and we're mashing, blast to maintain
We're the kings in the game, and things ain't to change

I'll be the gossip for ya block
When y'all explain to each other how I creep with the Glock
The 4-5 nigga did the damage
I took two to da dome, so, nigga, fuck a bandage
And all you got was a bodybag
Accommodations to the morgue, equipped with a toe tag
Now you know I'm a killer
You cross my name out on the ward, it lets me know y'all remember
Mashed on your hood and got a trophy
If you really want revenge, nigga, come get me

This gangsta shit is like a drug, (I got to ride)
And live for the hood to show my love

Crips and Bloods, oh

This gangsta shit is a must, and plus I bust
And puff angel dust for the headrush
I like the way the Teks spit when I'm lit
I feel like ""Fuck the police"" and ""a bitch ain't shit""
Plus I represent my curb to the fullest
And them, so-called hogs be like track stars when I pull this
Beat out, get the sheet out when I roam
Cos the first fool caught slippin on my block gettin done
So fuck a job, dogg, I jacks for my figures
Plus I live by the trigger and I ride for my niggas
On all-gold twisters on a front and back Caddy
Every broad in they ghetto wish I was their baby daddy
So which lucky ho wanna be Miss Mack 1-0
You gotta have a gang of ass and be a dick-suckin pro
I wanna down bitch for my bride and when we ride
Gotta love this gangsta shit and be down for the homicide

This gangsta shit is like a drug, (I got to ride)
And live for the hood to show my love

This gangsta shit is like a drug, (I got to ride)

Guess what? OG, in the game of rap
And everytime that i see 'em, I get a nigga dept
what's up, to my partners Tray Deee and Goldie Loc
Quick motherfuckin' niggas, always gon' smoke
In the concrete jungle, man you know where it's at
It's the place, where you want to leave, don't want to be at
Believe that, you can check in, but you can't check out
Like Rae, everybody doin' their own shit to get paid
You might die, but it all, goes along with the job
Even ride, do whatever it takes to survive

Jumpin out the white with the park lights on
High as a kite, shootin dice all night long
I stay hustlin and mustlin to keep my effect
Smoke a quarter or a half, fuck a cheap dime sack
I'm livin to the limt or don't live it all, get it and ball
Nigga look at me and my doggz

[Bad Azz]
I floss my gold chain, with diamonds
The Italian style, the bad person Tray Davis, Soopafly, and Style
I never lost my touch not a bit
Today I'm better than I was yesterday with this 
Don't test touch my fast hand draw
If my strap is in the car, I'm going bomb to the shore
We the number one supporters, drugs, gang love
Smoke the weed, throwing up gang signs, we gangstas
Got to love, got to thugged it up for our mouth
I be on this every single day, no doubt
See me, I'm worth about 450 and ounce
I drop sixteen bars, and go buy me a car
I'm just an local universal with my vocal
Put the hip hop fan base in a choke hold 
My gang Dogg Pound, a gang of gangstas and entertainers
Sign an autograph, bangin, and we rich and we famous

And now I see you on a video with Michelle?
Lookin' like straight bozos
I saw it comin' that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Livin' with the whites one big house
And not another nigga in site
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough
White man just rulin'
The Niggas With Attitudes, who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homeys
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-a-dick

You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me

'Cause you know I'm the one that flown

But Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so
I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
'Cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be 2-10
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke

Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs

As soon as I enter the crib, I'm sensing a bad vibe.
No welcome home kisses even though it's been a while.
And you tryna play it off but I can see clear through the mirror.
I'm looking straight at your face bo and it's missing a smile.
Cause your girlfriends say they spotted me, exchanging some kisses with some bitches
Up in my business while exchanging some digits
(But you know) That these chickens vindictive they trippin any chance they get
(And I know) Everything we've been building breaks if it gets through your head
(We go) From trust to issues to what I do after shows.
I always got an excuse to not come home.
And you always got an excuse to look through my phone and hate on every person that I meet on the road.
She says things are not the same in so many ways.
I been rolling with some snakes since my trendy days.
And she never let it phase but that's what she says,
That they offend me, with envy, right through the Fendi shades.

But I, thought you grasped the difference between real and fake.
Granted I, understand the fact that I'm not in your Marc Jacobs.

Listen to build with ya', gettin to know what's the deal with ya'
But you miss the picture baby cause you're telling me you're hurt.

But I'd throw away the fame, anytime, anyday.

Remember how I used to be a shelter in the rain (In the rain)
And I know that I've been wrong, just let me make it right.
Baby won't you come back home, if only for tonight.
I will (I will) cherish every moment you're here (You're here)
Still.

Chorus (Trey Songz)
Can't let a good thing go down the drain.
Hey girl, it's ups and downs but we got to maintain.
I know it we get hard out there (Hard out there)
I know we get rough out there (Ooh)
But you can't leave, I can't do this without you.
Hey you can't go, I can't do this without you.
There's one thing you must know, I can't do this without you.
Cause baby I need you by my side, I can't do this without you.

Mo Thug be the love
Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

And scream out, ""Mo! (Mo! Mo!)""

Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone

Let a sista nip this in the bud
You can't face me, this playa
Hell of a rhyme, sayin' these family scriptures

Never know weaklings, when a sista fall victim hit 'em

It's the Mo Thug Family Scripture
We singin', my people and me

Hey, gotta give up peace to the love inside of my halo
Gotta stay headstrong for soldiers
Like I told ya we need peace (Dear Lord, can you help me?)
(Never forget) to pray for the people
'Cause when you need 'em, they there
You better beware Mo Thugs' steppin' with weapons
We comin' with the word of the Lord

Don't step in our face or my bullets ?
Fed up with these haters, I'm breakin' 'em up
'Cause they fakers, and fakers fakin'
Pullin' them gat on Mo Thugs
But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs

Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

Takin' a journey deep on the darkside

You better have the heart to handle the pressure

Fuckin' with my life, fuckin' all the above.

Ain't a groupie bitch alive get a child from me

And while she waits for an autograph, you give her a kiss
She slips me a hug and a look that's knowing

Turn up the kid mic 'cause ya'll ain't listening right

They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us till we found our own way through the maze

Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
What up mah, frontin like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

And there goes, a black girl, lost

Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever gettin down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, startin' wars, makin me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keepin' me on all fours
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you
Igloos of ice trickin' on you, you never listen
To this nigga spendin' Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin' screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Comin' home wantin' more from a college degree

Diamonds all shinin', lookin' all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin', tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin' the same ol' games
Messin' with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes, a black girl, lost

Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value, too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin' to
More than the world, but not knowin' nothin' about you
You leavin' the crib, takin' all your kids out to
Drop them off, lettin' some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growin' up seein' it, it should remind you, you bein' lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancin' topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doin' silly things that is wrong

Tre Williams,"This was my favorite girl for years, she knows the way I perform
Sometimes I pull my boxers down, ya'll, with one Timb on
It be times, you know I stay away when her friends on
For some reason, she be really hot, when her friends gone
That's when I slide on over with a Guinness on the stouffer
To talk a little shit, then get a little closer
Like, what up boo, you know that Ghost loves you
I get butterflies when we hug and kiss, do you?
Huh? Answer me, let me if it's the truth now
That pretty mole above your lips looking cute now
Ooh child, I'm patient, my mind's telling me
To stay calm, I wanna get it off like a G bomb
On top of your skin, I'm sliding it in
When I'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again
Then we can hold on through the night, fan on and covers on
It's bright from the TV light, peace, good night

Looking out my window, sun shining bright
Birds are singing, trying to make things right
Now I got music, oh, on my radio
And I can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors
Now I don't want no one, on the catch me side
But ever since you left, said goodbye

[Chorus]
I wish you were here with me
I said I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here, with me

And thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seen our love, is never gonna find me
And I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day
When all I see is, time slipping away
Oh and I got to talk, to keep myself together
But all I see is stormy weather

[Chorus]

Now I got to get, get myself together
Cause I can't take no more, of this stormy weather
Now I wish you were here with me
I wish you were right here
I wish you were here with me, ooh

[Chorus]

Night falls and I call for you, love
But there's no one here to answer
No, no, no, oh
The wind blows and I turn to catch ya
But there's no one there but my reflection
No, oh I said I wish you was here with me",I Wish You Were Here,2009

Well, if I didn't, darlin', I'm sorry

And I'll spend my life making love to you

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

All the burden that love will fare?

Just how much I care?

Tre Williams,"Ayo, i’m back after nine years, that’s 36 seasons
Shit is changed up for all types of reasons
Staten island ain’t the same, shit is lame
No familiar faces son, i’m dodging the game
I want a clean slate, but these cops stay screwin’
Snatching me up off the block, what am I doin’?
Oh, it’s officer dingle and his sidekick berry
Driving me around the hood so I could worry
See how fucked up it is there’s crackheads on every corner
Kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana
I ain’t feeling it, this ain’t the way I left these blocks
And my name’s faded out like some old damn socks
I want respect, these streets was my playground once
I was the mack across 110th on these stunts
Not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty
I would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine

Yeah, homie, i’m the kingpin called future
Make a killin’ in these buildings in the millions
Got ‘em feeling like brewster
Shit hot as fallujah
Kids grown now, they cock rugers
Welcome back to the sewers
Where new whips maneuver
No kids playing, no safe and sound havens
There’s tre pound cases on the playground pavement
No more dudes with 22’s in their sneaker soles
Kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes
I’m that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow
Heavy iron on the ready, my shit’ll crease your clothes
Keep a flock of sweetest hoes, yeah, I sleeps with those
Little slum young keisha coles with cheaper clothes
Undercovers all around the gutter, they creepin’ low
I stays ahead, kid, I toss bread like pizza dough
I keep the tef around my torso with the piece below
That bulldog short nose, g be at peace with those, you know

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine

Mama bear was a church woman, pop’s skated off
I was impaired, an introverted youngin’, a lot changed my course
From nowhere to my first onion then them cops came 
Across flashed the badge, took my stash, told my little ass get lost
Threw me off when my grind was prime time then
You could step on and stretch mine’s to a nine times ten
I was gone, remembering though that fine line’s thin
So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
Dealers ran the streets, but the d’s ran them
I was a killer underneath, but needed expansion
Something to constitute being high in a coupe
The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit
Salute to the enforcer, call me officer now
Supporter of paraphernalia, I toss it around
The link to the cartel, costs is down
It’s that denzel in training day shit, caution my grounds

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine",The Battlefield,2014

Ever since I hold a benz, bitch be all in my face

Tre-8 they ain't ready for this dog (Ooh)
Smoke One and No Limit (Ooh)
All the way from California to New Orleans
Ask em' about it, so much pain boy (So much pain)

Birds in the kitchen, palms itchin'
And all y'all niggas in the game pay attention
As I teach, ain't got no time to preach
2 for 3, 4 for 5, 16 a fuckin' key
Don't laugh, niggas like to back stab
But where I'm from see yo brother on a body slab
New Orleans, the city of the candy cream
A bunch of projects full of jackers and dope fiends
As I cry, think one day I gotta die
But I don't give a fuck cause ain't no love from the outside
As I walk to the projects
Niggas killin' dope fiends behind fuckin' county checks
And my younger homie smokin' dope
The niggas I used to hang with doin' that boy broke
And they gone off that water, water
Ain't no love from New Orleans all the way back to Florida
It's just a bunch of pain

[Chorus]
So much pain, so much pain
So much pain, so much pain

I'm feelin' so much pain, holdin' back my tears of anger
As I walk through this danger zone
That I used to call home
Strangers got my nerves all jumpy
But it's best I watch them niggas who be smilin' actin' chummy
Like it's all real
I don't know why they got it in for me
Like my girl Jill, who was sleepin' with the enemy
Never knew the handy dope was a sad one
Now I know the vibes that I felt was some bad ones
Takes a mad one, females so precious
Tryin' to move on since our best friend left us
Got my baby still stuck in this drama filled blue
Tryin' to get my pockets on so I can snatch him from this zoo
And paint a clearer picture cause the one I see now
Got my vision all blurry, hard to see my way out
Bow my head to Lord and pray hard for a change
Can lift a sister from feelin' this
So much pain, so much pain

[Chorus]

Growin' up as a youngster, comin' around that thug life
Dog nights with drug fights just made me get my mind right
But times I just slap on ya block and leave me bleedin'
It's hard for me to run cause they might catch me when I'm sleepin'
But I'm peepin' out the go round, wipe the sweat from my forehead
Take a swig of the beer and reminisce about what my boy said
He told me keep my head up, don't get filled with all this drama
Havin' talks with my diary cause I can't have talks with my mama
And still feel my eyes fold I start to be the best
Sometimes I cock my nine and wanna get it of my chest
But I guess I'll just take it one day at a time
But until a nigga die I got these feelings on my mind
Fuckin' so much pain

To lil Tony,to dime P
Seritz,Burnell,can't believe
That he's gone, the Scarface
Dank,Loot,and Meathead
And what about Kenny Sep
And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe   
Pac, jinte, the gats go pow

Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money

What you mean I need a hero
A hero is a zero to me
The only hero that I know is them niggas in my hood G
They gave me the game so I enhanced the gat
Than I took the game, and ripped it out the frame
I tried and told ya
A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me
that nigga MoXs on the Howard J G

But this goin out to my homies out there slangin D
That still hustlin in the game tryin to make it
But y'all niggas better realize you can't fake it

Something that'll never end, this shit is going on like fucking numbers
Black on black crime, nigga it go like this here
We live an eye for an eye

You kill me, I kill you, my partners kill your partners
And you dead ain't no love on my spot
Me and my partners pushing rocks
Got them 17 round glocks at your ass spitting like loogies
We packing heat, 32 round clips, my automatic uzi
But I look into the eyes and I stare, I see death
Goddamn thinking ""the fuck?"", it could be me
My little homie on the ground crying
I'm thinking I'm gone, Oh my lord
My little homie Tony's dying (ripped his heart out)
He never had a chance to see his life glow
And he never had a chance to see his wife bro
And his little kid is only 8
It ain't about me or you motherfucker 
You gone peep defeat off the tree  
Cause you die and you murder, how could you live on the streets
And you never hurt, another nigga with a glock G
I'm thinking about Tic-Toc Boom, there goes another one
Send him to the moon
Ain't no rocket ship bitch, it's the temple of doom
I mean the ghetto, cause it's wicked
Most niggas out there in the hood, trying to get a chicken
But never even seen a bird
They die for that cain and that weed and they water
And they to fucking high, to see the enemy
Niggas that pretend to be, fools don't come close to me
Your best friend will kill you
I'm from that 3rd Ward, Caliope Projects 
Where they peel your caps like bananas
Police trying to stand on them buildings with them radars and scanners
But they can't stop the murders 
That's happening in my hood motherfuckers
Cause everybody study capping in this
Everyday, all day niggas dying, mothers crying
But y'all niggas ain't realizing that the hood is murder
Find your ass in a 6 inch gurder
Cause niggas banging like Charlie Chan
You'd better pack a piece nigga 
And welcome to the never ending game

The never ending game, (the dope game) the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep, or die on these streets
Cause the ghetto ain't no joke
Niggas in my hood everyday getting smoked
Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies
Y'all can't stop a nigga please, even if I'm dead G

Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby
My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht
Might take a little time for me to see bigger living plus or not
But I want stop until I'm touchin' my figures, you better move(bitch)

Been so broke and embarrassed couldn't afford a tooth brush fool
If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O
Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low
Runnin' up and down Houston slangin' dimes and nickles

Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin' shit
Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin' shop

Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten my sign is stop
It's twenty mother crooked fuckin' styles in 'em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom

Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom
Breakin' 'em down, I make 'em see their doom

Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller

Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop

It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight

Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin' that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out, a poison, a deadly venom

Yeah Mad, fuck that, you know how we do
Know what I'm sayin'? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent

Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin' G you better flee

'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up

No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

Nigga, you know what I'm sayin'? Fuck that
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac

Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see

I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me paid
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey

I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everyday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray

First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks
Pac's out puffin' blunts
Deadly venomz

Ha ha ha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache 'bout to clean shit up

Throw up your middle finger, start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin' out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit

You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch

Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em
That's the results of fuckin' with the fifth venom in denim

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Five motherfuckin' deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four, ninety-five all that other shit
We takin' this motherfucker over this larger hit

No one to speak
Upon there behalf

Six oclock news half the world's got nothing to eat
But you were a young man, fought in a good war
Now you look around and wonder who you were fighting for

Reach out your hand he will walk by your side
From the hell we have made here all the way to Peter's gate
Talk about Jesus, Jesus everyday

Got a place down in Florida, been there since fifty two
Now it's practically a foreign country, all the spics and jews
Niggers and ingrates, that's what taxes are for
White shoes, welfare, Cadillacs, every kind of whore

In the fire of this time, some will be saved

Treaty of Paris,"Let's take a train down to the lake 
It's such a gorgeous day out 
We'd be crazy 
If we stayed in 

Just 
Just because we're bored 
It doesn't mean we have to 
Continue being bored 

[Chorus] 
To all my friends I hope 
That every word I wrote 
Finds you well you know 
I loved you all alone 

We'll spike the soda cans with booze 
The weather on the news says 
We should expect 
The sun to make it's long 

Awaited return 
On the big blue screen 
Now this I gotta 
See for myself

To all my enemies 
I welcome memories 
I hope these words could mend 
Like a swift kick to the hand 

Go find a spot to stop and 
Set up shop and 
Appreciate the girls 
On rollerskates 

We'll hide our true intentions 
And our true dispositions 
Behind our calm demeanors 
And some fucking dark sunglasses 

Let's blow an entire afternoon 
To just enjoy the view 
It feels good to have nothing 
That I have to do

I welcome memories

Treble Charger,"I know a way that you can
Stay away from me
It's easier than what you
Heard and what you see

I've been counting and what I keep
Isn't what you need, knowing what you need
Building sure-fire hearts into life-like ones

I can't complain, explain it's hard to be that way
I can be that way
I can't believe it's up to me to fade that way
I can fade that way
Reminding me I cannot stay

I think it's strange that you
Could change your mind for me
I only bought your line
Of thought that I could see

You've been counting on what I keep
Isn't what you need, knowing what you need
Building sure-fire hearts into life-like ones

Reminding me I can't stay alone
I don't know what you mean

I know I've finally worked it out
I can be that way, I can be that way
I know I've asked is this all true
I can fade that way, I can fade that way

It happens all the time
It's not too encouraging, 
You never prayed for anything.

I may withstand the strongest
Can't help their similarities…
[Doesn't seem at all to hear]
Is it fair now? Does it matter?…

I will not!

Not sure what you say
Makes any difference anyways
Tell me what you mean
With any hope of coming clean
It's bit too late to you now
But I appreciate 
The never-ending signals

face painted ciggarette white.
you asked the cleanest boy you found,
you couldnt see me turned around.
his fingers stretched across your empty gaze,
that i just can't escape.

(chours)
as the red fades from your wrinkled dress,
a picture of the people you've impressed.
hangs on a wall around here,
visions starts to crawl when I'm near
and the evening waits,
while you get caught up to your own mistakes.
made up of different lines,
I wouldn't want to keep in my mind.

i wondered why you'd come around,
remembering your little girl frown.
your answers kept the crowd at bay,
with complements unwilling to pay.
i had some things id like to say to you,
but they just can't be true.

Treble Charger,"I know that I have to sleep at night
And we all need someone to blame
no one ever has to realize
That we all get tired again

I think I've been cast
In the wrong play
My lines were written
On the day before

I can see there's nothing out there
That I don't know but I don't know
It can be such empty logic
That I don't know
I don't know

In the time it takes to understand
Is a pause where we like to complain
no one is required to take a stand
And we all get time to explain

I think I left something behind
The lime green plastic olive branch before

Cause it's driving way too fast
And it's me behind the wheel

The less it seems to be real
