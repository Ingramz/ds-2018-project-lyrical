Nancy Harrow,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,1988
Nancy Harrow,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door 
I'm taking the time for a number of things 
That weren't important yesterday 
And I still go 

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go",Fixing a Hole,1988
Nancy Harrow,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down",Good Morning Heartache,1988
Nancy Harrow,"Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side,
I stay home by my radio,
But I'm satisfied!
All my flirtin' days are gone,
On the level from now on!

Don't go for any excitement now,
Books are my best company.
All my opinions have changed somehow,
Old-fashioned as can be!
When you really learn to care,
There's a thrill in solitaire!

Keepin' ou of mischief now,
Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire,
It's you whom I desire!

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me!
I've told them in advance
They can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin' out of mischief now!

All the world can plainly see
That you're the only one for me!
Say I've told them, told them in advance
That they can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin', keepin' out of mischief now!",Keepin' Out of Mischief Now,1988
Nancy Harrow,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
",Street Of Dreams,1988
Nancy Harrow,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you",Why Was I Born?,1988
Nancy Harrow,"So often as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting
The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Own,2000
Nancy Hays,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

How high is the sky?

Nancy Hays,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Nancy Hays,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable [Ballad],2002
Nancy Hays,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When [Fast Fox Trot],2002
Nancy Hays,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

But in your dreams whatever they be

Nancy Hays,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2002
Nancy Hays,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again

Nancy Hays,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2002
Nancy Hays,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Nancy Hays,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,2002
Nancy Hays,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2006
Nancy Kelly,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Nancy Kelly,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same

And it's too sad

You love me, then you snub me

Nancy King,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1999

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""

And then it had to be with you

Nancy King,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Nancy Kwan,"I'm a girl, and by me that's only great!
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy,
That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervy.

I adore being dressed in something frilly
When my date comes to get me at my place.
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy,
Like a filly who is ready for the race!

When I have a brand new hairdo
With my eyelashes all in curl,
I float as the clouds on air do,
I enjoy being a girl!

When men say I'm cute and funny
And my teeth aren't teeth, but pearl,
I just lap it up like honey
I enjoy being a girl!

I flip when a fellow sends me flowers,
I drool over dresses made of lace,
I talk on the telephone for hours
With a pound and a half of cream upon my face!

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... like... me.

When men say I'm sweet as candy
As around in a dance we whirl,
It goes to my head like brandy,

Says he loves ev'ry silken curl
That falls on my iv'ry shoulder,

You just have to walk along
Dreaming as you go
Asking for the things you?re needing
You never can go wrong
If you have faith that things are happening as they should
And just believe each step you take is leading you to something good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

But it was home. 

Mother always said I'd be very attractive 
When I grew up, when I grew up. 
""Diff'rent,"" she said, ""With a special something 
And a very, very personal flair.""
And though I was eight or nine,
Though I was eight or nine, 
Though I was eight or nine, 
I hated her. 

Now, 
""Diff'rent"" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty.
""Pretty"" is what it's about. 
I never met anyone who was ""diff'rent""
Who couldn't figure that out. 
So beautiful I'd never lived to see. 
But it was clear, 
If not to her,
Well then to me 

That everyone is beautiful at the ballet.

I don't know what they were for or against, really, except each other. 
I mean, I was born to save their marriage 
But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said, 
""Well, I thought this was going to help. 
But I guess it's not."" 
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life. 
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this. 
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief 
And he'd say to me, 
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?"" 
And I'd say, ""Daddy, I would love to dance.""

Didn't whisper sweet nothings. Never told me I'm pretty.
You sure weren't perfect. What's perfect these days?

You cheated at cards, and lied when you hung out
In bars making time with those girls you called old pals
I cried when you left me,
Now I'm wondering when you'll make it all up to me?

Don't I have the right to be over you yet?

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

That I adore you, dear

You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2003

Llevo en la mano el cigarro y pienso ""otro crack con pies de barro""
Mejor jugar de callado y nunca treparse al carro,
Ando emperrado en encontrar el tiempo perdido, en lamentos apretados
En penales casi siempre mal pateados
Laburo por chirolas, no quiero seguir y decido salir de la cola

Suelo mojado, el tránsito encajonado
Como un perro que ladra encerrado en una trampa desconocida
La lluvia que salpica la memoria enrojecida por la nostalgia
Como lágrimas partidas, como lágrimas perdidas
Tiempo mejor, cielo de miel

Calentón, que me rajo del laburo y que me rajó con razón

Nancy Sinatra,"Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Ohh-oh-oh summer wine

Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine

I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Ohh-oh-oh summer wine

Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mmm-mm summer wine

When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Ohh-oh-oh summer wine

Mama's got a feelin' that she must be near
Just to help her Papa keep his conscience clear
So Mama Goes Where Papa Goes
Or Papa don't go out tonight!
No, Papa don't go out tonight!

Here's your bedroom slippers and your fav'right pipe
Here's your yellow bathrobe with the purple stripe
Here's your armchair and the paper that you read
And here's the lovin' mama
Who's got everything you need
I've had plenty, Daddy, and you ain't the worst
But your Mama here believes in safety first
And any married woman will admit I'm right
A husband in the home is worth a dozen out of sight!

Mama's got a feelin' that she must be near
Just to help her Papa keep his conscience clear
So, Mama Goes Where Papa Goes
Or Papa don't go out tonight,
No, Papa don't go out tonight!

Nights in white satin

Never reaching the end

Letters I've written

Never meaning to send



Beauty I'd always missed

With these eyes before


Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore



Cause I love you

Yes I love you


Oh how I love you


Gazin at people


Some hand in hand
They can't understand
Just what I'm goin through





Cause I love you
Yes I love you

Oh how I love you



Some try to tell me

Thoughts they cannot defend


Just what you want to be

You will be in the end


Cause I love you
Yes I love you


Oh how I love you

With their bazookas to get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbons and legs in tights

Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
Then I was thinking to myself this could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say

Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California

(Any time of year)

Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say

[Chorus]

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast

The radio plays my favorite song

And peace is the sweetest sound

And baby's coming back to me
Oh baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming home

He was just sleeping somewhere
And now he has come to hold my hand
And we go walking

And the years have all fallen away
And I remember you like yesterday
And the summer's here
So say goodbye to rain

And baby's coming back to me
Oh baby's coming back to me

Nancy Sinatra,"Standing in the crowds
Lost out in the street
Loving the chaos
With my heart down at my feet

Taking every step like it's my very last
Looking round the corners
Searching through the glass
For a glimpse of you
Eyes of shining blue
All these memories of you come to haunt me
They come to haunt me

Taste the stinging rain
Falling on my tongue
Hanging on your words
Cherish every one
Can't bring you back no matter what I say
Driving in my car just to drive away
Hear the tires spin
Round and round again
All these memories still come to haunt me
They come to haunt me

The city sleepin' cross the river
I'm up alone burning down the spark
Well I wonder where you are tonight
And how far you drifted out there, out there in the dark

Wind at my window
Rattling the door
Pounding on my heart
Like it's never done before
Still I wonder if it could be these memories
No matter how I try they never let me be
Always find a way
Calling out your name
All these memories of you stay and haunt me
Mmh come to haunt me
Mmh they still haunt me
Oh they come and haunt me
",Burnin' Down the Spark,2004
Nancy Sinatra,"There's a place in the sun for anyone
Who has the will to
Chase one and I think I found mine

So, close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh.
Let me kiss you, oh.

I zigzagged all over America
And I cannot find
A safety haven

I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
when it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
out in the middle of a big dance floor.
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more.
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight. 
Whoo!

Surely you know I always want to be there
Holding your hand and standing by to catch you when you fall

Let me be there in your morning

Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watching you grow and going thru the changes in your life
That's how I know I'll always want to be there

Nancy Tabb Marcantel,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Petit Oiseau (Snowbird),2005

Nancy White,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17 (To Be 17 Again),1983
Nancy White,"Thanks to life, which has given me so much
It has given me two eyes, and when I open them
I clearly distinguish black from white
And in the high sky, its starry depths,
And from the crowds, the man that I love

It has given me hearing, which in all its breadth
Day and night records crickets and canaries,
Hammers, turbines, barking, dark clouds,
And the tender voice of my beloved one 

Thanks to life, which has given me so much
It has given me sound and the alphabet
And with it the words to think and speak
Mother, friend, brother, and the light that brightens
The path of the soul of my loved one 

Thanks to life, which has given me so much
It has kept my tired feet walking
With them I walked through cities and puddles,
Beaches and deserts, mountains and plains
And your house, your street and your courtyard 

Thanks to life, which has given me so much
It gave me my heart, which shakes its frame
When I look at the fruit of the human brain
When I look at good ones so far from bad ones
When I look at the bottom of your light-color eyes 

Thanks to life, which has given me so much
It has given me laughter and it has given me tears
Thus I distinguish between joy and pain,
They are all elements of my song
and of your song, which is all one and the same",Gracias a la Vida,1998

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

I'd never, no, no, stop loving you.

Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?

And never spend time finding where their heart belongs

And never letting go of what we're dreaming

Many say that love's a silly game
But when I'm playing love with you it never ends
And when I'm feeling all my days aren't going right
You shine your light of love and brighten all my nights

And that's why I love you 'cause I can't sleep one night

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind a silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have done my rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better then to cheat a friend,
And waste a chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again.
The way I danced with you.

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend.
To the heart and mind
If your answer's kind
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is all you find.

What am I without your love?

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe it's better this way

We could have been so good together
We could have lived forever
But no, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.

It was blue as ink
Or at least I think I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers, sharp as thumb tacks coming down like lint
And it made you squint when the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like strings and changing things like leaves

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint, crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
And nights and noise and bees and boys
And days

I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink isn't really sky
And at times I think I would gladly die
For a day of sky

Nancy Wilson,"From too much talk to silent touches
Sweet touches
We turned out hearts to love
Then tried it, first time romance
There in the quiet, love learns to dance

We loved, we slept, we left the lights on
The night’s gone and morning finds us caught
In life’s most sensible trance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Old songs, a new life
And hearts that understand like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

From too much talk to silent touches
Love touches
When pure emotion takes the moment
We take the chance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Where you caught in the rain? 
No, don't bother to explain. 
Can I fix you a quick martini? 

As a matter of fact 
I'll have one with you, 
For to tell you the truth 
I've had quite a day too!

Guess who I saw today, my dear! 
I went in town to shop around 
For something new, 
And thought I'd stop and have a bite 

When I was through.
I looked around for someplace near, 
And it occurred to me 
Where I had parked the car, 

There is a most attractive French cafe 
And bar.
It really wasn't very far. 
The waiter showed me to a dark, 

Secluded corner, 
And when my eyes became accustomed 
To the gloom, 
I saw two people at the bar 

Who were so much in love, 
That even I could spot it clear 
Across the room.
Guess who I saw today, my dear! 

I've never been so shocked before. 
I headed blindly for the door.
They didn't see me passing through,

Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk;
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you!

And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart,
I've got to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart,
I take heart!

Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove

Nancy Wilson,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

And never spend time finding where their heart belongs
Some prefer to love and leave not wanting to reveal
A feeling deep inside, a love that could be real

For some this is okay but I can't sleep one night
Without your precious love around me

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever in love

Many say that love's a silly game
But when I'm playing love with you it never ends
And when I'm feeling all my days aren't going right
You shine your light of love and brighten all my nights

And that's why I love you 'cause I can't sleep one night
Without your precious love around me

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever

I'm glad we have the right to choose
(Win or lose)
I'll take the blame for my mistakes
I'm never letting go of what we're dreaming

The time has come
(Time has come)
For us to share our love
Ooh, ooh, ooh

",The Two of Us [Featuring Ramsey Lewis],1999
Nancy Wilson,"I watched you leaving and
never tried to get you to stay
Somehow I talked myself into
believing that
It s just another game we play

But the moment you re gone
the heartache begins
Like an ocean of sorrow that I
keep drowning in
Should I reach for the phone or
wait for your call
I don t care who was wrong I
won t go there at all

[CHORUS:]
Oh I wish you were here
It s sometimes like these that I
desperately need you
And I wish you were here
There s a world of love 
inside to share
I wish you were here

And the thing that keeps us
from drifting apart
Is the fact that we re bound by
the soul and the heart
Every power on earth every
storm we ll survive
Come hell or high water love
won t denied

Oh I wish you were here
It s times like these that I

many fights
When we should be making up 
Let s get past the pride
And reach down inside for love

I'm crossin' you in style someday. 
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker, 
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin'your way. 
Two drifters, off to see the world. 
There's such a lot of world to see.

Nancy Wilson,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship [From Lady in the Dark],2001

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love [From Calamity Jane],2001

That you have no love to give her

And she lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body 
With your mind.

When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 
And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 
But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 
And you want to travel with him

And you think maybe you'll trust him

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.

Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,
Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail

And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.

Fading on the grass.

The bell I rang to prove that I was strong

The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind a silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have done my rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better then to cheat a friend,
And waste a chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again.
The way I danced with you.

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend.
To the heart and mind
If your answer's kind
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is all you find.

[Chorus]

What am I without your love?

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe it's better this way
We've hurt each other with the things we want to say.
We could have been so good together
We could have lived forever
But no, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth witholding nothing

I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine

E a falta é a morte da esperança
Como um dia que roubaram o seu carro
Deixou uma lembrança

É como chão no mar
Liga o rádio à pilha, a TV
Só pra você escutar
A nova música que eu fiz agora
Lá fora a rua vazia chora

Pois meus olhos vibram ao te ver
São dois fãs, um par
Pus nos olhos vidros para poder
Melhor te enxergar
Luz dos olhos para anoitecer
É só você se afastar
Pinta os lábios para escrever
A sua boca em minha

Que a nossa música eu fiz agora
Lá fora a lua irradia a glória
E eu te chamo
Eu te peço: Vem!
Diga que você me quer
Porque eu te quero também!

Faço as pazes lembrando
Passo as tardes tentando
Lhe telefonar
Cartazes te procurando
Aeronaves seguem pousando
Sem você desembarcar
Pra eu te dar a mão nessa hora
Levar as malas pro fusca lá fora

E eu vou guiando
Eu te espero, vem!

Que eu te sigo também eh

Não vou te inundar, não vou te inundar

Nando Reis,"Deus do céu
Para onde que foi tudo que perdi?
Vai pro céu
Quem não acha nesse mundo um lugar
A Deus e o céu
É o balcão da eternidade achada e perdida
Fez inverno
No verão da vida de quem não encontraremos mais

Desse resto
Que sobrou na imensidão do amor partido
Desse mar
Que o sertão irreversível não vai molhar
Desce o véu
Da viuvez e o manto enegrecida
Um deserto
Vastidão, nuvem de sino a badalar

Quem me ajuda a trazer
As estrelas e a lua pra essa noite?
Quem tem fome deseja comer 
Cada nuvem no céu
É muito bom bom bom
Mas sem perder o tom
Que faz cantar e amar
Na eternidade, a madrugada é linda
A eternidade é madrugada ainda

E diga o que você
Vê quando eles vêem

E o que eu posso ler
Que eles ficam melhores

Mas espero que ainda dê tempo
De dizer que andei errado e eu entendo

As suas queixas tão justificáveis
E a falta que eu fiz nessa semana
Coisas que pareceriam óbvias até pr'uma criança

Por onde andei enquanto você me procurava
E o que eu te dei foi muito pouco ou quase nada
E o que eu deixei algumas roupas penduradas

Nando Reis,"Pra você guardei o amor
Que nunca soube dar
O amor que tive e vi sem me deixar
Sentir sem conseguir provar
Sem entregar
E repartir

Pra você guardei o amor
Que sempre quis mostrar
O amor que vive em mim vem visitar
Sorrir, vem colorir solar
Vem esquentar
E permitir

Quem acolher o que ele tem e traz
Quem entender o que ele diz
No giz do gesto o jeito pronto
Do piscar dos cílios
Que o convite do silêncio
Exibe em cada olhar

Guardei
Sem ter porquê
Nem por razão
Ou coisa outra qualquer
Além de não saber como fazer
Pra ter um jeito meu de me mostrar

Achei
Vendo em você
Explicação
Nenhuma isso requer
Se o coração bater forte e arder
No fogo o gelo vai queimar

Pra você guardei o amor
Que aprendi vendo os meus pais
O amor que tive e recebi
E hoje posso dar livre e feliz
Céu cheiro e ar na cor que o arco-íris
Risca ao levitar

Vou nascer de novo
Lápis, edifício, tevere, ponte
Desenhar no seu quadril
Meus lábios beijam signos feito sinos
Trilho a infância, terço o berço
Do seu lar

Nando Reis,"Sabe quando a gente tem vontade de encontrar
A novidade de uma pessoa
Quando o tempo passa rápido
Quando você está ao lado dessa pessoa
Quando dá vontade de ficar nos braços dela
E nunca mais sair

Sabe, quando a felicidade invade
Quando pensa na imagem da pessoa
Quando lembra que seus lábios encontraram
Outros lábios de uma pessoa
E o beijo esperado ainda está molhado
E guardado ali
Em sua boca
Que se abre e sorri feliz
Quando fala o nome daquela pessoa
Quando quer beijar de novo, muito
Os lábios desejados de sua pessoa
Quando quer que acabe logo a viagem
Que levou ela pra longe daqui

Sabe, quando passa a nuvem em brasa
Abre o corpo, o sopro do ar que traz essa pessoa
Quando quer ali deitar, se alimentar
E entregar seu corpo pra pessoa
Quando pensa porque não disse a verdade
É que eu queria que ela estivesse aqui

Nando Reis,"Cada um de nós tem o seu próprio jeito de ser
Mas tudo que foi feito só fizemos juntos
Porque você ouviu a minha
E eu, a sua voz

Um ou outro aspecto e o inverso do direito
É a busca do desejo sem culpa

Preferem os cactos
Que a solidão da noite assista a flor
Quando se abre

Que eu só fico bem ao seu lado

Mas não consigo dormir sem seus braços

With no vivid reason here to find

But when I ask will you be coming back soon

Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

And green leaves turn to gold
Then I remember last September
You and I said goodbye
Whispering that we would be returning
When autumn comes again

Now autumn roams the hills once more
But you forgot your vow
Now here am I with, alone with only memories
Only lonely memories, autumn memories of you

I get a hungry yearning for your arms
Love, when a heart is so blue
It shadows bright October's golden charm

The flaming moon reminds me of
The night of love that we once knew
Each tiny star is but a prayer
That when it's fall again, love will call again
And you'll be beside me to make
My autumn dreams come true

Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I feel real bad.

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that, all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know,
That I never mean to take it out on you

And that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you,
Oh,

Oh, oh, oh, baby - don't you know I'm human
I have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself, Lord, regretting
Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I've done

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a La Vida,2016

Search the wild until I'm found again

Quench my thirsty tongue, I'm drinking it
And I'll step off my stool
Break the rules until I'm linking them

I heard her holler from the kitchen

Us kids running through it in our underwear

Old dog napping on the front porch, his ear just a twitching
Fell asleep on granddaddy's lap

Oh, oh, you can dream about it every now and then

Stole one of mama's mason jars
Poked holes in the lid and made a firefly lamp

I'm still haunted by the taste of the kiss
I was too scared to give him

And you make plans you never keep

Hoping I can do it through the shadows, I can shine bright
Usually in life there's one shot and this is our night
Listen to the rhythm we givin' and it will make you
Start pushin' through barriers it'll take you
Wherever that you wanna go, never too late to

Napalm Death,"Cut the line, I'm suffocating
Cannot feel, without I'm aching
Desire lost, my heart is racing
I feel cursed, am I mistaken

Doomed to walk the path that's chosen
Regret, a mountain yet to climb
Belief, that pain will ease in time
Embrace, a life that I betrayed

The icing on the hate
Trapped inside, this self-addiction
Forced to see my own afliction
Through the eyes, deseased reflections

Kaleidoscopic, death in segments
A second chance at resurrection
The high of high's seemed endless
The shapeless fear ascending

Ride the carousel of punishment
The days of dazed emotions
And spells I cast seem broken
Ride the carousel of punishment

Cards are down, a choice needs making
Look a the past, or keep on dreaming
Pulled the plug, for now I'm winning

Napalm Death,"Time goes by and makes me
Wonder what I'm here for
I'm waiting for a sign or
Someone to open the door

At times my life seems at an error
Without a real purpose
Will I survive problems in my head
And beneath my own surface?

What the hell is going on?
I feel like I'm dead
Is it life around me
Or am I fucked in the head?
I'm tired of hypocrisy
And murder by the state
I'm sick of your stupid lies
You tell us it's okay

Life seems at an end
Death is on your back
Ronnie and his generals
Just sit back and laugh

Time for you to act now
To make one final stand
There is no alternative
Your life is in your hands

You think that you're the only one
To solve your problems with a gun
Does it make you feel like a man
To take a life in your hands?

There is no way out
You'll just have to fight it out
No useless world to save
Nuke threat and no escape

Judgement day, no guilt

Demon seed, invades the earth
Our task, let us pray

This our way, we can not turn.
We've reached our time, this world must burn.

Knowledge lost, there is no shame.

Napalm Death,"So drawn? I warm to the fire in their hearts
This ain't romantic gesturing
It's a hand to head the charge

To the indifference of the preening, idle rich
Such champions are cancerous, tumors in the gut 
Of affluent bliss

Why let these scab observers tag them trouble-makers?
It's naive? You're on a leash.

This is the cure for their common complaint [x2, second time scream]
Ditch the gullibility
Strike 'til the green runs dry
bring them to their knees
Or squander as they thrive

Agitate!

Hoist those standards, arm in arm
Walk the walk and talk the talk
