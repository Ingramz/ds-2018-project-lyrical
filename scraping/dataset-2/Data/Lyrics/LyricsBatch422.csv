Jef Neve Trio,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,2010
Jef Neve Trio,"The evening breeze
Caressed the trees
Tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze
Tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist
Tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly",Tenderly,2010
Jef Neve Trio,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas

Jeff Albert,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,
Jeff Alexander,"You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away

This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

How could you tell me that you're goin' away?

But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy,
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart

And look into her sea-blue eyes,
And she sees the road by the poplars,
Where they met in the bygone years,
For the first little song of the roses,
Is the last little song she hears:
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,
But there's never a rose like you!

Here to stay is a new bird

And pretend that he is Parson Brown

But you can do the job when you're in town

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made

Jeff Alexander Orchestra and Chorus,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love
 
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally",Be My Love,2007
Jeff Alexander Orchestra and Chorus,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",We Three Kings Of Orient Are,2010
Jeff Ament,"Don't feel like home 
Ease a little out 
And all these words alone is nothing like a poem 
Putting in, inputting in 
Don't feel like methadone 
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone 

It's nothing as it seems 
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

One uninvited chromosome
A blanket like the ozone

It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees is nothing he believes

Saving up a sunny day
Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding, rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes, it's home

And all that he frees
A little bittersweet
It's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that you see it's home",Nothing as It Seems [Jeff Ament Montana Demo] [Demo Version],2011
Jeff and Sheri Easter,"Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my light is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home","Precious Lord, Take My Hand",2002
Jeff and Sheri Easter,"Shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on

You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end

We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye

Pulse's racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark

Jeff Baker,"hatll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
Whatll I do?

When I am wondring who
Is kissing you

Jeff Baker,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me,2007
Jeff Baker,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Jeff Baker,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel

Jeff Baker,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Jeff Baker,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2005
Jeff Baker,"If you wait for me
then I'll come for you
Although I've traveled far
I always hold a place for you in my heart

If you think of me
If you miss me once in awhile
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart

Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

If you dream of me
L like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart

Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

I've longed for you
A and I have desired
To see your face your smile
To be with you wherever you are

Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting

Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me

And say you'll hold
A place for me
I in your heart.",The Promise,2005
Jeff Baker,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing

And I am a fool for beauty",You Are Too Beautiful,2005
Jeff Baker,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2005
Jeff Ball,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood,2002

Beans don't burn on the grill.

Gettin' our turn at bat.

May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

I guess you're wondering
What I'm doing
Home so soon
Naw, I ain't sick
It's just this morning
When you told me
You didn't feel like
You were the most
Important thing
In my life anymore
Well that broke my heart
So, I had to turn around
And come back
And tell you what
I'm gonna do about it

I'm gonna light
The bedroom candles
Take the phone
Out of the wall
We can lay around
And talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man
You've been missin'
Startin' with some
Long, slow kisses

I just want to let you know
How ashamed I am
For making you feel that way
Darlin', I'm so sorry
I guess I've just been spendin'
Too much on making a living
And way too little
On making love
But if you can just find it
In your hear to forgive me
Girl, I swear
From this moment on
You'll always know where
You stand with me

I'm gonna light
The bedroom candles
Take the phone
Out of the wall
We can lay around
And talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us

Is you and me this close

I was scared, had a nightmare; 
Momma was there for me to hold.

Daddy, he was different; he never said it much,
But I heard him loud and clear when he brought home that ball and glove.
Then it took on a brand new meaning,
I wasn't just a boy no more, when she moved in next door.

Where you from? What's your name?
want to go to my game?
Got the keys to my Dad's old truck.
Turn the radio off to remember the song,
We held hands and there we was,
Love.

Pages kept on turnin', 
There I was with someone else.
First time in my lifetime, 
I wasn't livin' for myself.
I knew I wasn't fallin', 
Anywhere I'd fell before.

This place was different: 
It was deeper, it was more.
Then it took on a brand new meaning,
Yeah, it was strong and it was true, 
Knew what I had to do.

Found a ring, hit my knees,
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe,
My heart had me all choked up.

Said: ""I do,"" as we cried; wedding bells,
Waved goodbye, the whole church knew it was:
Love.

Then it took on a brand new meaning,
When the doctor said: 
""It's time to watch your miracle arrive.""

She could take an old potted plant and raise it from the dead

And when I wrestled with the devil, shel led me through the dark

For the very first time.
Never seen it all before,
Hope it's not all mine.

On Monday morning all alone,
I woke within my house of stone.
I ventured forth unto the day,
These things I saw upon my way.

Trees and flowers were wrapped around,
With people's castoffs on the ground.
Roads and noise of glass and steel,
And people snared within the wheel.

Tuesday looked into the sky,
Where birds in peace were left to fly.
Thunder rolled and lightning flashed,
I watched the world as people dashed.

Friday's sadness began to creep,
Upon me like the deepest sleep.
It seemed that only I could see,
Just what my world would finally be.

'Cause we've ended now as lovers
Does our love for one another have to end

And how playing it wrong I kissed your hand
But when our love has gone and passed
Why does the good exceed the bad
Well that's one thing I'll never understand
'Cause I remember us at class
You were always the one to pass
And gave me answers right to see me through

Someone turned the light out in my life
And I don't know if I can make it through the night
I'm afraid to wake tomorrow
With no one by my side
When all the words that broke my heart
Will still be on my mind
Love is the light
That filled my life with dreams
When it used to shine on me
Finally the spark has faded in the dark

I believed that love would find a way
Now I don't know if I could give it all again
After all the words of wisdom
That fill me with regret
I'd rather cry remembering
The times I can't forget

Love is the light
That filled my life with dreams
When it used to shine on me

",I'm Not Talking,1998
Jeff Beck,"I want somebody here to tell me why,
There's always smoke up in the sky.
Please don't make me want to cry,
Detail has not been seen.
Summer trees should all be green,
Plain and green as they have been,
Sun don't ever change the scene,
Please never let them die.

What do you want? [Repeat: x4]

Sounds which soar above my ears,
Will naturally precede in years,
They only cause a flood of tears,
I want to turn and run.
Don't need someone to make my fun,
Only need to see the sun,
I will not go and cause harm,
I cannot think that way.

What do you want? [Repeat: x4]

Sit spellbound by a flickering screen,
Watch the ever changing scenes,
Listen to the rising screams,
Of children of today.
Lock your doors and stay within,
Upon your face the stupid grins,
Penalty for unrealized sins,
Committed on your way.

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

The gracious calling of the Lord,

Rise up and follow thee.

O calm of hills above, 
Where Jesus knelt to share with thee 
The silence of eternity, 
Interpreted by love! 

Drop thy still dews of quietness, 
Till all our strivings cease, 
Take from our souls the strain and stress, 
And let our ordered lives confess 
The beauty of thy peace.

We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsy's, tramps, and thieves

And lay their money down

Picked up a boy just south of mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done

When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,1997

But it can't hold a candle to you
Do you remember them rides in my blue car
Back when it was brand new

Well it's a good old car
But the clutch is a little loose
And the brakes are screaming
A song called what's the use
But it's good for one more trip
One more trip to you

The lightning's meant to strike
The tall pine trees
And the birds are meant to cry
And wheel in the breeze
But some things baby
I guess they just ain't meant to be

I'll close my door against the wind
I'll park my old blue car

Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
Her green eyes bloom goodbyes
With her head in her hands and your kiss on the lips of another
Dream brother with your tears scattered round the world

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name

Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games

Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around and blow your kiss hello to life eternal,

Racist everyman, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son
Oh crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone

You better turn around and blow your kiss hello to life eternal

There's no time for hatred, only questions
What is love, where is happiness, what is life, where is peace?
When will I find the strength to bring me release?

Tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal

Jeff Buckley,"There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die

My fading voice sings of love,
But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time.
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow
Oh my love

And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind,
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

What's really going on below

And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know

This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe its just because you didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry
'Cause I know that in time, I'll only make you cry
This is our last goodbye

Did you say, ""No, this can't happen to me""
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
Saying maybe you didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
Ooo didn't know

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories, offer signs that it's over
Over",Last Goodbye,1994
Jeff Buckley,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love",Lilac Wine,1994
Jeff Buckley,"Looking out the door
I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so
You'll never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it.
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away,
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
He has no one

So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return,
Or, will I ever learn?
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late.

Lonely is the room the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
That won't ever come

It's never over,
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles
When I slept so soft against her
It's never over,
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over,
She is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
But maybe I'm just too young,
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh lover, you should've come over, yeah yeah yes

I feel too young to hold on
I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind
To see the damage I've done

The blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal

If only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no mojo pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't want to weep for you, don't want to know

Then we sat on our star and dreamed of the way that we were and the way
That we wanted to be
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
And you were for me

And turned to each other, say, 'I love you, baby, I love you'

Jeff Buckley,"This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know

This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe its just because you didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry
'Cause I know that in time, I'll only make you cry
This is our last goodbye

Did you say, ""No, this can't happen to me""
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
Saying maybe you didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
Ooo didn't know

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories, offer signs that it's over

Jeff Buckley,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do you? 
Well it goes like this :
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah
 
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah...
 
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrough ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
 
Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
 
Well, maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah...",Hallelujah [Live from Bataclan],1998

When I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean, what I mean.
They say I must be crazy
Cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit.
Cause I know it's me that's hitting out
And I know I'm not full of shit.
Down by my bottle, filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where a rail has been, has been.
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me.
Gave my heart, deep in hell,
Time to shave, shave  it off, it off
No time for romantic escape and your
Fluffy heart is ready for rape
Off we go. Off we go. Off we go
You're sitting in your comfort
Who don't believe I'm real
You cannot buy protection
For the way that I feel.
Your progressive hypocrites
Handing out their trash
It was mine in the first place
So I'll burn to ash.

And laid them down in colored sheets
Well, who needs illusions,
Of love and affection when you're out
Walking in the streets, your mainline connection.

There's no town the boy cannot belong

Why did you come here?
Is it to excavate all your sins? Boil within?
Slaughter like the daughter of the devil you send me.
I have to deal, you called me here.
You couldn't say that you were juiced
The night that you were introduced
To Demon John
Gonna take him with you when you go?
Dance down slow. Oh, way down.
You cannot escape the bar-side  angel dissector
You undo you life with too much cocoon,
Who's your protector?
Dark is the city where the white girls walk by,
Down below your eyes, just like fireflies.
You call me here, come on here, follow me dear,
Past cascades of rage and fear.
You called me here.
You couldn't say that you had been juiced
The time that you were introduced to Demon John.
Well, you knew you had to want to go , dance down slow.
By the light of the sun, murder comes
Today or tonight
Better get yourself and transcend it,
Or burst of light
Blaze stars into me,
While the love breaks through here and now.
So, murder by the light of the sun.
Please don't get too close to me.
You said you are for real, it's not pretend.
All memories stolen, know this for yourself.
How would you like to be the happiest man in the world?
Behind the weathered field hands, whose blistered
Paws
Harvest cut, for wedding clothes they'll never wear,
Marching down a road that was never there.
It takes place on a sunlit face and the backbone broken.

Or you resist the beds of bliss
Fortune makes fools of us all
My dear materialista, silence was insane,
The parting was mutual.
Don't you want the rocket to rock out?
There's room for us both to fly.
Tell the man I'm never coming back again.
Tell the man I'm never coming back again.
Why should you notice at all?
Gone again beside you will fall
Down to the sea out of the skies
Of gold cards and casual tears
I have only come to see you shine
Feminine smiles the right side is wise, more than I.
I want to be your lover,
Lipstick my name across your mirror.
Blood red with flaked gunshot glitter
And be one with all you disowned in your young life.
You paranoia politician diva.
You paranoia politician diva.

Will you let go of your heart,
Left behind a hypnotizing swirl
The semi's left behind.

Don't you want to rocket to rock?
There's room for both of us to fly
Same show everyday, don't have to blow up in the sky.
So I just came from Hicks town,
Left my coins behind
Maybe some poor cloths pony will himself a life
Why should you care if I crash your affair?
Why should you notice me? I really want to see you shine.

I want to be your lover,
Lipstick my name across your mirror.
Now, be one with all you disown,
True love has come to us all.
Blinded by the flame, right side smiles,
Organized male, love, my silence was insane.
The parting was mutual the moment I became
A paranoia politician
Diva
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva

Jeff Buckley,"There's no easy answer, none to blame or forgive.
Two cripples dancing to the end we lie.
I'm not with you, not of you.
Not with you, not of you.
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
And I hope I'll catch you in the throws
Of one last look at the wonder,
One last look at the wonder.
Oh, god, I love you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else we come to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throws
Of one last look at the joy that we've become.
But there's no easy answer, none to blame or forgive.
We were two cripples dancing, to the bitter end we live.
I'm not with you, but of you.
I'm not with you, but of you.
Oh, god, I loved you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
We had a birthplace in common
We had separate beds and lives.
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
Yeah, oh.","I Know We Could Be So Happy, Baby (If We Wanted to Be)",1998

Jeff Buckley,"Looking out the door
I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so
You'll never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it.
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away,
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
He has no one

So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return,
Or, will I ever learn?
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late.

Lonely is the room the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
That won't ever come

It's never over,
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles
When I slept so soft against her
It's never over,
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over,
She is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
But maybe I'm just too young,
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh lover, you should've come over, yeah yeah yes

I feel too young to hold on
I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind
To see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love I've waited for you
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late","Lover, You Should've Come Over [Live and Acoustic in Japan]",1999
Jeff Buckley,"I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I walk by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
All the day we met, I went astray
I started rolling down this lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway

Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
Lost highway",Lost Highway,1999
Jeff Buckley,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you? 
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed - oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling, I don't know where else I can go, over and over
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See the sea it wants to take me, the knife wants to slit (cut) me
Do you think you can help me? 

Sad veiled bride please be happy - handsome groom give her room
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you
More than she loves you - and I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go - over and over
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Jeff Buckley,"Ghost calls to visit
With my keys in his pocket
Kisses in my mouth with his
Eyes hanging out of his sockets
My memories crumble
Under still resistance
I was torn out like pages
From the book of existence

I woke up in a strange place
My mind a blur and some blood on my chin
I made a call for a blackened cab
Some destination was moving on in
I remember the words that you told me
How they come down so hard, so plain
Fate is going to find your love in a
Glass of champagne

I lied to my host I told him
I knew how far I could go
When I emptied my guts out
On his brand new stereo
Well he paid me to go upstairs
And spend a night with his friend
I never want to see my face
In the mirror again

I woke up in a strange place
Music so loud that I spilled all my beer
I met a ride in that blackened cab
Some destination was all that he had
Easy now, this car is speeding up
For my last chance, crashing to freedom
Fate is going to find your love in a
Glass of champagne

Sweat pours down
You're in the back seat sleeping
And she waits by the window
On an empty bed, weeping
The ghost guns the motor
To the land that he promised me
I guess this is the time when your
Best intentions become facts again

This is no song for the dislocated
The one you loved but it turned to be hated
Because the lies of the spirit possessed you
Because the eyes of your lover resist you
Listen now, you keep your aim steady
As your temple turns to kiss the pistol
Fate is going to find your love
In a glass of champagne

Fate is going to find your love
In a glass of champagne",I Woke Up in a Strange Place,2000
Jeff Buckley,"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
And suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away.

No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.

The man that won you
Has gone off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning.
Don't know what happened. It's all a crazy game!

No more that all time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, goodbye!
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up
There's just no let up the live-long night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away...
The man that got away.",The Man That Got Away,2000
Jeff Buckley,"Mood swing whiskey
Drank it all in the morning
Waiting for the dark to move in
Sitting in my step-sister's kitchen
Horseflies on the window sill
Eyes trained on the lemon king
And wishing it were a gun

I'm thinking of our wedding rings
Trapped inside the heater
Spring water on the floor of this
Sex starved room

The nightmare's fires burn
The waves of bliss
I tried to stop it with my hand
I was lost in the kiss
With you

Mood swing whiskey
Your bliss, the actress,
Bliss, the assassin
Bliss, the abyss

Did a crazy shot of whiskey
In about zero to sixty
All I could see was the beer

I face the future with a drink in my right
Eyes to the sparkling gloom
Body naked, afraid, and amazed

Say boost me up to your junkyard paradise
Boost me up to your junkyard paradise
With a sweet-ass photo of you

She cheated, and she lied, and you stole her
Stung my tongue just like
Sweat from her shoulder

Ooh, mood swing whiskey
Your love, the destroyer
Love, the destroyer
Love, love...

Yes mood swing whiskey has my brain
Only you can break this chain
Are you here in my bed again
Can you hear my love again (x4)

Run down the subway station babe
I'm packing my rod
All and present histories erased
I am a punishing god
Mood swing whiskey
Yeah the leaves are made of
Messy things again

And I said this is all the headless acrobats
Faces crushed in the circus dust
All for the law of gravity
And the price of admission

Beautiful loser warm hearts have let you down
Beautiful loser warm hearts have left you
Oh no, you...

I think of mankind in quotation marks
Ever since I took a drink from you
This is for all the headless acrobats
Faces crushed in the circus dust
All in the name of gravity
And the price of admission

So long ago, when I was small
All summer long it had a fair
Wonderful fair with swings and all
I used to love my little fair
And at the close of every day
I could be found, dancing around
A merry-go round that used top play

Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux

All summer long my little fair
Made everyday like a holiday

Ah days that melt into nothing

Door the door was open
There's nothing left for a boy but to hide these dreams away
All those dreams decay

Jeff Buckley,"There is a child sleeping near his twin
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind
That dark angel he is shuffling in
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled
 
The love you lost with her skin so fair
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
Her green eyes bloom goodbyes
With her head in her hands 
 and your kiss on the lips another
Dream brother with your tears scattered round the world.
 
Don't belie the one who made me so old
Don't belie the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came...
 
I feel afraid and I call your name
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain
Your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
Your eyes to the ground
  and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over...",Dream Brother [Nag Champa Mix],2002
Jeff Buckley,"There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid to die

My fading voice sings of love, but she cries to the clicking of time,
Oh, time.  Wait in the fire...
And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow
Oh my love...
And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave behind... Wait in the fire
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow...",Grace [Live],2002

Could this be magic, loving you so?
Could this be magic, my dear, having your love?
My prayers were answered so far from above

I thought that it would be just a memory
To linger my heart in pain
But too much cries, I opened up my eyes

But every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man that put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

Say, I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any way now
I shall be released

Oh yeah
But you know, whoa
Ooh yeah

They're standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud
Crying out he has been framed

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any way now
I shall be released

Everybody say with me

I see my light come shining
What about west or east
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

She left here last early spring, is livin' there I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though new things come and go
She might think that I've forgotten her but don't tell her it isn't so

We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
But to think of how she left that night, still gives me a chill
And though our separation, well it chilled me to the heart
She still lives on inside of me, we've never been apart

If you're making love to her, kiss her for the [Incomprehensible]
Who always has respected her for doing what she did
For I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard

Well, I meet a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Well, either I'm too sensitive or else I'm just gettin' soft

If you see her

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart 'cause they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her, she can look me up if she's got the time

And all because of the man that got away.

No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.

The man that won you
Has gone off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning.
Don't know what happened. It's all a crazy game!

No more that all time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, goodbye!
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up
There's just no let up the live-long night and day.

And if you're so clever why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so very entertaining why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so very good looking, why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, 'cause tonight is just like any other night, that's why you're on your own tonight

But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
But something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Didn't we? did we? should we? could we?
I'm not sure but sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friends say
Don't you find?
We all fall in love sometimes

hmmm...

Oh, yeah..
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
And our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us

Jeff Buckley,"This is, uh
Based on some music that I heard in a dream
That I saw in a dream
Called, it's going to be called ""you and I"", ouch!
'Cause it's what the people in the dream were saying

You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you

It's like that, I heard the people singing that in a dream
Yeah, and it was a dream where I was in an auditorium at a college
And everybody was congregated and singing the same words
And there was this, y'know a bunch of
This band on stage and they were like, y'know, sorta spacey Deadhead band
With teen- y'know, like, guys in their twenties, like a bunch of grunge guys but
Kinda playing this, this, other thing, not like what I'm playing here on guitar
And the people kept on beating out, uh
Rhythms on drumsticks
This really great rhythm, it was in like, 7/4, this really cool space jam
And what it was, it was a song
I dreamed that this song was about, uh, about this guy, uh
Or, y'know, the person in the song is singing to his lover
Supposedly
That uh, y'know, he's completely theirs
The lover has forbidden anybody to have contact with him
The lover has taken away his freedom, taken away his days and nights
Taken away his, y'know, his dreams
Uh, sent away his friends
Forbidden him to, y'know, get close to his parents, all that stuff
And what it was, it was an AIDS rally
And that song was about AIDS
Or about something like that
So every time the refrain came around
The people would say ""you and I, you and I, you and I""
And they point to the sign that said, y'know, like
It said AIDS with a circle with a slash through it
And they go ""all for you""
They go like, point to the sign, so that was the dream
I woke up with it

And if you're so very entertaining why are you on your own tonight?

I played it down and I played it cool

I said, ""I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl""

Since Momma passed away
He's always workin' overtime
I know that he can not afford to buy that car
Even though he'd love to make it mine
 
It's not the car that I'm needin'
Just a chance to be with him
I know that once these days roll past us
They will never come again
So little time, and we spend way too much apart
There would always be a part of us
Together in that car
 
Finally let go of that dream 
And the time we could have shared
It was a distant memory
Until last fall a call came sayin' Dad was gone
Could I come quick, he left a note for me
 
Buried Dad right next to Mom
Up on Crowley's Ridge
'N' there I said my last goodbye
I opened up he note and found a set of keys
""Here's your car son, I hope it flies!""
 
It's not the car you're needin'
But it's my chance to be with you
I hope you understand I always did
The best that I could do

Running from my past
On the day that I ran into you
Life had taken its toll
I was staggered by the blows
I'd been through all I could go through

There was scars on my heart
Where love had left its mark
Wounds that I still carried from the fall
Oh but your love built a bridge
Where I'd put up a wall
And you loved me scars and all

With so many flaws
I still wondered what you saw

Traded old war stories about love we have lost
I'd have never got your number

As I read the evening paper
I looked up to see a look
Of sadness in her eyes

I asked her what was wrong
She sighed and said,""It's nothing""
But something in that nothing
Made me realize

It wouldn't kill me
To show her that I love her
It wouldn't kill me
To make her feel alive

I could take more time to tell her
How she makes my life so right
It wouldn't kill me
Like it would if she ever said, ""Good-bye""

I don't know what gets in me
Not to take these precious moments
And share them with the only love
That makes it all worth while

I get so caught up in other things
When the only thing that matters
Is the way she leaves me breathless

An' we both were the same age
Everyday, playin' fetch
Shakin' hands, he'd lick my face

And I was unaware
The day would come
An' when he died, for the first time
I knew what real pain was

And I never was the same again
From that moment on, real life began

Senior high, girlfriends
Football games, graduation
Summer break, spend my time
Fillin' out applications

A few superficial years went by
They were all a blur
And in the most unlikely situation
There you were, yeah

And I never was the same again
From that moment on, real life began
With you, with you

By your side, scared to death
Felt the pain you were fightin'
Placed my palm on your head
Spoke your name, just keep tryin'

An' then you closed your eyes
An' took one last breath
And when it was over, you looked up
Laid our baby across your breast

And I never was the same again

I was trailed by twenty hounds 
Didn't get to sleep that night 
Till the morning came around 

chorus:
I set out running but I take my time 
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine 
If I get home before daylight 
I just might get some sleep tonight 
I ran into the Devil, babe 
He loaned me twenty bills 
I spent that night in Utah 
In a cave up in the hills 

I ran down to the levee 
But the Devil caught me there 
He took my twenty-dollar bill 
And he vanished in the air 

Got two reasons why I cry 
away each lonely night 
First one's named sweet Ann Marie 
and she's my heart's delight 
Second one is prison, baby 
the sheriff's on my trail 
And if he catches up with me 
I'll spend my life in jail 

Got a wife in Cheno, babe 
And one in Cherokee 
First one says she's got my child 
But it don't look like me

You can borrow from a friend 
But the Devil will give you twenty 
When your friend only got ten

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

When things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

That you were the best girl I've ever had

I spilt the tea and I ate the news
Ah, you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
I can't move, it's hard to think

Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see

You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way

With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away

",Lose Myself,2002
Jeff Deyo,"A crown of thorns, a mockery of You, my God, of You, my King
You took my place, a place so bleak and cold

A crown of thorns, a symbol of a desperate deed,
Your desperate love
Your kindness, Lord, resounds inside of me

(Chorus:)
There will never be a crown so cruel
You wore it like a king, a king of fools
You will always be the only King of kings

A crown of thorns, a crown of hate
For all You had, for all You gave
The king of all would rather serve than reign

There will never be a crown so cruel
You wore it like a king, a king of fools
You will always be the only king of kings

Crowned with many crowns
You are, crowned with many crowns
Crowned with many crowns
You are, crowned with many crowns

A crown of thorns, a crown of death
Forsaken by both God and man
But You prevailed to live and reign again

(And I know that) there will never be a crown so cruel
You wore it like a king, a king of fools
You will always be the only king of kings
The only king of kings
The only king of kings

I wanna be free in Jesus
I wanna be satisfied in You and You alone
Take this heart
Take my life
Pull me close

My heart has heard Your call
But I have closed my ears
I've said I would follow You
But still I've chased the wind
I've stretched my hand toward You
While holding to this world

And reaching out to You

Jeff Deyo,"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell
The guilty pair, bowed down with care
God gave His Son to win
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade

To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry 
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Though stretched from sky to sky

How measureless and strong!

Jeff Duff,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away

Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And when he finds who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Jeff Foxworthy,"Twas the night after Christmas and all through the trailer
The beer had gone flat and the pizza was staler
The tube socks hung empty, no candies or toys
I was camped out on my old La-Z-Boy

The kids they weren't talking to me or my wife
The worst Christmas they said they had had in their lives
My wife couldn't argue and neither could I
So I watched TV and my wife, she just cried

When out in the yard the dog started barkin'
I stood up and looked and saw Sheriff Larkin
He yelled, ""Roy I am sworn to uphold the laws
And I got a complaint from a feller named Clause""

I said, ""Clause, I don't know nobody named Clause
And you ain't takin me in without probable cause""
Then the Sheriff he said, ""The man was shot at last night""
I said, ""That might've been me, just what's he look like?

The Sheriff replied, ""Well he's a jolly old feller, with a big beer gut belly
That shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly
He sports a long beard and a nose like a cherry""
I said, ""That sounds like my wife's sister Sherri""

""It's no time for jokes Roy,"" the Sheriff he said
""The man I'm describing is dressed all in red
I'm here for the truth now, it's time to come clean
Tell me what you done, and tell me what you seen""

Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell
It wouldn't be the first time I spent New Years in jail
I said, ""Sheriff it happened last night about ten
I thought that my wife had been drinking again""

When she walked in from works she was white as a ghost
I thought maybe she'd seen one of them UFO's
But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head
And stopped on the roof of our good neighbor Red

Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shutter
A freezer full of venison standing right on Red's gutter
Well, my hands were a shaking as I grabbed my gun
When outta Red's chimney this feller did run

And slung on his back was this bag overflowin'
I thought he'd stolen Red's stuff while old Red was out bowlin'
So I yelled, ""Drop it fat boy, hands in the air""
But he went about his business like he hadn't a care

So I popped off a warning shot over his head
Well he dropped that bag and he jumped in that sled
And as he flew off I heard him extort
""that's assault with intent Roy, I'll see you in court. ""I'll tell you what sheriff if you put a subnet""
On me I won't show up ill hold up in the cellar
And you'll never rout me outta there

Jeff Foxworthy,"Greetings why?all
And welcome all you danged foreigners from other nations
Dear Lord be with our guests and prepare them
For the butt whopping they are about to receive

The Olympics in Georgia
God you know we're gonna screw that up
I guarantee you
When they let those doves go at the opening ceremony
There are gonna be guys in the parking lot with shotguns

And we will not have a flame
That big without a pig on it, I guarantee
Some fat guy going
?Danged good barbecue top of them stairs up there
They ain't got no hand rail be careful""

Of all the games that the rednecks play
There's some crazy events
If you know about the redneck ways
Then it makes perfect sense

Hell the Olympic rings will be five old tires nailed together
See that's my fear, they're gonna get the list of events
They gonna have no idea what half this stuff is suppose to be
Like for fencing, they'll be giving people bailing wire and sheet metal

There probably have to cancel water polo after
The first two or three horses drown
I tell you instead of discus throwing
They'll be flinging Ford hubcaps

You can't blame them for the way they are
But you can sit back and grin
'Cause they'll do something that's so bizarre
You'll want to see it again

If you could ever get into their minds
There's no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play

And you know they haven't even thought about it
But the river they're having the kayak races
On is the same river they filmed deliverance at

That ought to add a whole degree of difficulty shouldn't it?
'Cause if Ned Batty couldn't make it down
That thing a French man in a pair of biker pants ain't got a chance

Be prepared to watch the wildest show
Making her out in the line
You may not see them bringing home the gold
But they'll sure make mama proud

If you could ever get inside their minds
There's no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play

Hey Ed, I got a white one
",Redneck Games,1996
Jeff Foxworthy,"If you've ever been on television more than five times 
Describing what the tornadoes sounded like
You might be a redneck.
If you've ever cut your grass and found a car
You might be a redneck.
If your dad walks you to school because your in the same grade
You might be a redneck.
If you've ever been too drunk to fish...

If somebody asks to see your ID and you show them your belt buckle

If every day somebody comes to your house mistakenly thinking your having a 
Yard sale.

If you've ever had to haul a can of paint to the top of a water tower to defend 
Your sister's honor
You might be a redneck. 
If your dog and your wallet are both on a chain.
You might be a redneck.

They always make fun of the way I talk, I keep telling them I said your gonna be
Real surprised when you get into the habit in St. Petersburg and say,
""Y'all get into the truck, we goin up to the big house."" 

If you've ever financed a tattoo

If you've ever made change in the offering plate
You might be a redneck.

We have words in the south they don't have in other parts of the country
Now, you come to the south, we have words like, yu'nt to.
We goin to the mall, yu'nt to?
What letter does that start with, does anybody know?
I like this word alot, aight.
That's a word in Texas, aight.
Round lunch time every day, you'll hear somebody say,
""Hey jeet yet, naw, dju? Yu'nt to? Aight.""

If you go to the family reunion to meet women.

If you smoked during your wedding

Jeff Foxworthy,"Hi, I'm Jeff Foxworthy and I have got
A wonderful woman that I am totally committed to
Always figured if something was worth doing it was worth doing right
You ever see those dead possum lying in the road
They were partially committed

Rule number one, if she ain't happy, you ain't happy
And if she ain't happy long enough
You're gon' be unhappy with half your stuff
Early on in our marriage when we'd be
In the same room for a half hour and she wouldn't say
A word to me, I would make the mistake
Of lookin' at her and goin', ""What's wrong?""
Hopin' it was something other than me

Now I have learned, if we're in the same room
For a half hour and she doesn't say a word to me, it's me
Now, I just go up to her and go, ""Baby, I realize
I have done or said somethin' stupid and insensitive
And while I don't yet know what it is I would like a chance
To go up to my room and think about it for a little while""

This games been played for centurys
Ever since Adam fell for Eve
The sooner you'll learn, the better off you'll be
Just like me, totally committed

I've learned early on in our relationship
That women are complicated creatures and
Once I accepted that, it made things a lot easier for me
But I have found that because women are complicated
They like to think men are complicated too
You ever hear a group of women talkin' to each other
""Ooh, I wish I knew what he was really thinkin'""

Ladies, I will tell you what we're really thinkin'
We're really thinkin', ""I'd like a beer and I'd like to see
Somethin' naked"", that's all we're thinkin'
You go to a nursing home and see a ninety year old man
Goin' down the hall on a walker, that's what he's thinkin'
""I'd like a beer and well, I'd like to see somethin' naked""

This game's been played for centurys
Ooh, not that, not that
The sooner you'll learn, the better off you'll be
Just like me, totally committed

And I do believe women understand men
Better than men understand women, don't you?
Think about that, how often do you see a man
Stomp out of a room cryin' and a woman goin'
""What, what'd I say, come back""

And I do think men would take advice about relationships
But we're not gon' sit down and read magazines about it
You got to feed it to us in a way where we'd accept it
Sneak it into the play-by-play of a baseball game

And there's strike three Greg Maddux lookin'
Really good today and speakin' of lookin' good
Fellas, from time to time, your woman
Needs to be reminded that she's still lookin' good to you
Hey baby, have I told you lately you are as pretty as Greg Maddux?

Baby, where ya goin?
Ever since Adam fell for Eve
The sooner you'll learn, the better off you'll be

Jeff Foxworthy,"I just hate stupid people. 
They should have to wear signs that just say I'm stupid. 
That way you wouldn't rely on them, would you? 
You wouldn't ask them anything. 
It would be like, ""Excuse me, oops, never mind"" 
""I didn't see your sign."" 

It's like before my wife 
And I moved from Texas to California our house was full 
Of boxes and there was a you-Haul truck in our driveway. 
My friend comes over and says, ""Hey, You moving?"" 

""Nope."" 
""We just pack our stuff up once or twice a week. 
Just to see how many boxes it takes.""

A couple of months ago I went fishing with a buddy of mine, 
We pulled his boat into the dock, 
I lifted up this big 'ol stringer of bass this idiot on the dock goes, 
""Hey, y'all catch all them fish?"" 

Nope. 
""Talked 'em into giving up."" 
""Here's your sign."" 
I was out in the front yard with my boy the other day and he was 
Playing with his little friend, 
And he hit his friend and I went up to him 
And I said ""Hey, (smacks his boy), we don't hit."" 
He looked up at me like, ""Here's your sign, dad.""

I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel, 
There was a guy 
Inventing a shark bite suit. 
There's only one way to test that. 
""Alright Jimmy, you got that shark suit on, 
It looks good
They want you to jump 
Into this pool of sharks, 
And you tell us if it hurts when they bite you.""

Last time I was home I was driving around I had a flat tire, 
I pulled my truck into one 
Of these side-of-the-road gas stations, 
The attendant walks out, looks 
At my truck, looks at me, I swear to GOD he went, 
""Tire go flat?"" 

I couldn't resist. 
I said ""Nope"". 
""No I was driving around 
And those other three just swelled right up on me.""

Car around for about 45 minutes.

Jeff, you'll never get rid of me (Good news!)

We're closer than pages that stick in a book (Me and my shadow)
We're closer than ripples that play in a brook (Perfect)

Closer than a miser or the bloodhound's two eyes on me

That's when we're gonna rise
We'll start to swing
We're gonna swing to the skies

They ring-a-ding-ding!
Happy new year!

And now to repeat what I said at the start (Me and my)
They'll need a large crowbar to bust us apart (Sha-a-a-a-adow)

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll change the name Redskins, 'cause that's such a chore

Hey,recently I've been keeping out my butter
Out at night so it's soft in the morning
Is that risky? I love soft butter
That's not risky, you can do that with butter, you can leave it out
Okay, I'm taking that to the bank
What was I gonna say? Oh oh oh, I know
Could you do me a favor, Sarah?
Yes, anything
Could we take it just one more time?
From the top?
No, from the ending, I love that ending!

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll, just like Michael Corleone, we'll settle old scores!
Oh then we'll talk to the Tarot, and dress up like whores!

Some they fell down and some got back up
And fought back against the melt-down
And their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say 
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry 
I'll be back again some day

Jeff Hackworth,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then

Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?

You took my heart and threw my heart away

Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,
And a window on the mountains and the sea - how lovely!

This is where I want to be, here, with you so close to me

Why be shy?

Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?

To make a go of it

To be or not be
Let our hearts discover
