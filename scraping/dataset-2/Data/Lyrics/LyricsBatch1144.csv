The Gents,"I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I 
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her, ooh",And I Love Her,2006
The Gents,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows",And So It Goes,2006
The Gents,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

The Gents,"When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do is take a look at you,
Then I'm not so blue.
When you're close to me I can feel you heart beat 
I can hear you breathing in my ear.
 
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got  a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
 
Any time you want to you can turn me on to anything you want to. 
Any time at all.
When I taste your lips 
Oh, I start to shiver can't control the quivering inside.
 
Wouldn't you  agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
 
When I'm in your arms nothing seems to matter 
If the world would shatter I don't care.  
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.

The Gents,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

The Gents,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

That I
Would love to love you

The Geoff Love Singers,"You fill up my senses like a night in a forest,
Like the mountains in springtime,
Like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert,
Like a sleepy blue ocean.
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you,
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again.

Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way

The Geoff Love Singers,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile

The Geoff Love Singers,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up

Only to wake up

Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing

Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

But how can love last through tears

The George Benson Quartet,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Working strange mischief on her bride to be.

She laughed as her own head was chopped off and the fish came spilling out.

And I thank you for expelling those irritating pests,
Now if you'd slap me back together I'll be at my very best,
And we can go you devil, we can go.

Should've taken her time.
Should've set her hair on fire with vodka and lime,

Now the story takes a happier turn,
Cuz the devil loved the girl and the feeling was returned.
They cut through the trees knocking the tops off as they flew,
To a pretty place for kissing, a place with a view.
They watched a man lay down his hand in a game of chance,
The lust for luck and security is a hopeless romance.

'Cause you know the love we shared is nearly done 

And I'm goin' back to the place where
Folks like me are from 

My people won't forget me
They'll kill me if I try to fight
There's just no word for this where I come from
I was a trusted servant a noble scientist
But now a fugitive lover's what I've become 

And I'm goin' back to the place where
Folks like me are from 

I told you from the start that I was not what I appeared
But one look in your eyes and I loved you
My plans were corrupted by your sweet finger tips
And I was never meant to fall in love 

My work here was simple till I met you
I should've gone back a long time ago
This body's gettin' old and you know
I'll die in the cold winter sun 

I'm goin' back to the place
My old life and my old face
I'm goin' back to the place where
Folks like me are from 

Your lord knows I don't want to leave here
I'd like to stay in this little house and provide for you
And if I knew I'd only be risking my own life
I'd stay until they came and struck me dead
But I couldn't stand to see them hurt a hair on your sweet head 

So goodbye to laughter and kisses
Goodbye to your belly and your tongue
Back home I'll soon forget just what bliss is
And it don't seem fair

But I'm goin' back to the place
Back to my own race
You won't have to live life on the run
I'm goin' back to the place where
Folks like me are from",Folks Like Me,1997

Eats the scraps of some that care

The Germs,"I've read every book in the bible story
And all is every brought me was
another worry
Don't want god give me a jury,
See...there's no God to make
up my mind-
No God givin' me time...

I peered in every window where
I saw a cross
But I could never see just what they saw
In that piece of plaster on the wall,
See...there's no God to fear-
No God to hear your cries...

I'd prey to anything out there
If only I was given some sign to bear
But while I wait I'm gonna live,
See...there's no God to watch over me-
No God for human beings...

When I small I obeyed
his every word
Handed down to me by some
thoughtful blur
But now I am as big as he,
See...No God bigger than I-
No God frightening me...

In my image I made he him
and I gave him life
So he burned me,
the creature has risen and I
Think you can see just what it is
that's drivin'

-I just like it, let me have this dance,
Ya your jumping, had a crazy sound,
An it'll start running,to look him down,
Sound so neat,just give me a chance,
Move out of my seat, just hear that dance,
Start pushin my feet,and clap your hands,

just don't like it, goin up and down,
Ya there's really somthing,with a crazy sound,
And you'll start running now, to look him down,

about 12 o' clock, oh god I'm drunk,
The place is sacked, it the front lot,
But this night, I just don't like,

just don't like it, goin up and down,
Ya there's really somthing,with a crazy sound,
And you'll start running now, to look him down,

had a few drinks, we all felt inspired 
jumped in the stream, our shoes and canteens 
the water is bitter cold 
laid in the raft till it started moving 
the current just sang, the song was so soothing 
we stopped along the way 
on a beach in the sun on a beautiful day 
our boats collide, we feel the breeze 
we stay afloat and make the most of everything 
by noon we had swung the ropes in the woods 
missed all dangers, snakes and the floods 
burned by the rays and next to our legs, the water so bitter cold 
lunch had been saved along with the lighters 
wet cigarettes serve us as reminders 
never trust a man with food, change of clothes, and a drink in his hand 
our boats collide, we feel the breeze 
we stay afloat and make the most of everything 
the sun will set, the stars would shine 
the trees would shake, we'd all feel fine 
let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone 
we'd laugh away the sunburn 
as we laughed away his day 
what we lost means nothing 
for the memories will stay 
caught the last bus, with no time to linger
driver seemed to be missing a finger 
I turned and looked away to the bus, gravel road and a beautiful day
our boats collide, we feel the breeze 
we stay afloat and make the most of everything

'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you lose, the Devil gets your soul!

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire blew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in,
And it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished, Johnny said,
""Well you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done!""

Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil´s in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the bread pan a picking out dough,
Granny does your dog bite, ""No, child, no""

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny´s feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again,
I done told you once, you son of a bitch,
I'm the best there´s ever been""

He played,

The Ghost Doctors,"I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand

He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's

Better not let him in

Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair

The Ghost Doctors,"If on every ocean the ship is a throne 
And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold",Theme from Halloween,2011

The Ghost Inside,"We look up to the sky, I swear it never ends
Walk down the road on any path we choose
But then something changed, now days just aren’t the same
I’m feeling so empty like part of me has been removed

My youth is getting older
It got left out in the bitter cold
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong
Where did I go wrong?

Let me stop to ask the question
Will I ever get the chance to repeat?
I feel this more and more everyday
Take me back to when I used to believe

Nothing could prepare you, but we try our best
Failure upon failure, what happens next?
Nothing’s ever easy and life still goes on
Don’t stop push on before you become withdrawn
I’ve become withdrawn

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong
Where did I go wrong?

My innocence is gone
Where did I go wrong?
I feel it slipping away from me
Do you remember when we were free?

I’ve stood up on that ledge, and I know what you see
You’re looking over the edge and wanting to leap
I’ve written every word and expressed all my concerns
You’re losing that part of yourself, but it wasn’t meant to be

My youth is getting older
It got left out in the bitter cold
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn’t belong
Where did I go wrong? My innocence is gone",The Great Unknown,2012
The Ghost Inside,"One, two, three, four
I leave behind this sentiment to the man that I'll become
Telling him not to be burdened by the things that I have done
The longest days and endless nights have become the routine
Far beyond frustration it's the end to all my means

Constantly incomplete

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this

I may not be forgiven, but I forgave and I'll forget
Going through the motions is no way to exist
So if there's anybody out there that's so sick of feeling alone,
Has the damage already been done? 
You gotta get from underneath that gun

We walk before we run

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this, like this

Move me, choose me please before you lose me
Find me, drive me end the things that pride me
Move me, improve me ignite the flame that ruled me
Guide me, collide me I need something to survive me

With my back against the wall
I will rise above them all like this
Coming back against all odds, I stack brick by brick 
I will rise above them all like this

With my back against the wall I stack brick by brick 
I will rise above them all like this",Move Me,2014
The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger,"Paroles de Johannesburg
Missed my flight to Johannesburg
In this heat time seems absurd
Long shadows pantomime my skin
Nostalgia wants to be my friend

No one can you hear me
I've pieced you back together
Of sex linen and weather
Clover teeth and string
No one can you feel me
I made you out of feathers
Minutes pennies and leather
Show tunes and cavities

Even elephants can cry salty tears
While I haven't wept for seven years
My crows feet walk across the mirror
It's only tomorrow who gets old here

So I'm mailing a letter
To the port of Cassis
Oh I intend to let her
Get the best of me

And talk politics with trees",Johannesburg,2014
The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger,"Beautiful girls staggering back home
While dawn slithers over cobblestones
Twirling on twine rows of salted swine
Hovering above rubber gloves,
Puddles of reflected light

Skyscrapers tear an aerial scar
Where the clouds are born from cars
Constellations of movie stars
Now heaven isn't very far

In the window mannequins begin to itch and wish
That they could know the temperature of snow
In the gutter flutter pigeons and pages of porn
Where there once roamed unicorns

Down the yellow brick road
All the homeless scarecrows
Pimps and witches know
Red shoes won't get you home

Newspaper screaming like seagulls
At the coffee shop cannabals
Red lips howling at a mirror ball
It's the eclipse of the last call

I get purple with anger, at the things you do
And I'm green with envy, when you meet a dame

Their own need for deception
By the size of their lies and
The size of the stories that they're telling
They've proved themselves to be
Very small.....minded
Do you ever think when you're dealing with the worst
The outcome is the best thing for you
And by the good of evil is the knowledge
That you face it
I could put it in some theme of a tale
Or a story from a myth
But it means a simple thing
I ain't worth nothing if there's no perspective
Of truth in my life
I think I've had enough
I wonder why I don't just go off
Don't like to be a violent woman
But I know I have it in me.
I know I shouldn't be surprised
Why some people look like hogs rolling in the mud
It's a dying shame
That's where some look for the truth!

I can tell by the lines in your face
You seem to think if you just remove the problem

Another shot of whiskey and maybe I'll be ready
For what's still crowded in your head
Never seeing that all the good times
Are what walked in with the bad
I don't know why we compromise ourselves
I thought it was a common understanding
Which all I've tried to help with
Tell me, do I end up empty handed?
Another couple of beers while I'm safe here at the bar
And maybe I'll get me some rest
Don't know why all the good times have to
Turn-up with the bad It's like a sword of hate
You brandish it so proud
I wonder if you're taught what you feel
Or is it the way you got it cold dead in your eye?
It would be good if you could just leave me
Well enough alone
The crime of fate is what I have to follow
Through if I'm going to get past you

Only way I can listen anymore
Go ahead and drown me of everything
At least I still got my place at the bar

And now I am my only war
Each time I thought that I had answers
You come again;
Evil answers throw me back down in the hole

Some fool came up to me and said
""you'd make a star with that band,""

Why can't you fucking get it?""
'Cause all I've got to do is release through
These obstacles I've got to beat
Release from the man who manipulates me
By the breaking of my back,
With nothing left worth saving
All I gotta do is release through the
Obstacles I've yet to beat
Take us to a sturdy ship
Where we raise our glasses
No pints too dodgy here
We don't need our problems here
Away from all these people,
They're posing about, waiting for the next scheme
To tip them off and leave them drowning
In what they think is real
All that's ever been and all that's been said
It's not to my regret, you gotta
Face the edge of yourself
And they say if you got humor through it all
You'll find the will to survive what seems like hell
Take me to the water, launch me out to bloody sea
'Cause all you gotta do is release
Through these obstacles you've got to beat
Take us to the water
Launch us out to sea
And may the drunken mad ones follow me

The Gits,"When I'm going into the bar,
I'm there trying to ignore
This terror in me, I can't set it free
I can't make any sense
Unless it's in a song
And every time I try to feel
I only seem to wake up lifeless
Where would it ever end
When we fall to our own demand
It takes up your life
And throws it like dice
Each time we fail,
It never gets over looked
When you're thinking that the cards lay forward
It takes up your answers
With no second chances
Immobilized by the torment
It hits so hard, there's nothing more I can take
Needing each breath just to make it through
There's nothing more I'm expected to do
There's nothing worse than hating yourself
And parading around like you're somebody else
I wish that it would just all go to hell
Wanting some time just to be by myself

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

I watch till a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze, caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

Ask he said, and ask is what I did

Of my fault, I don't call a spade

Don't be shy, shyness is a little girl
And I feel if you're scolded like a child
All your elders, were once scolded too
We're just
No eyes, just ends
We're just friends

Don't shut it don't shut it don't shut it
Don't shut it don't shut it don't shut it
Don't you care ---- just pull in

And more than that it's talking to them
There is magic but really there's no magic
In what appears
I get quiet, I feel it all the while
No one's touched me for such a long time
And I get wounds she bathes them in salt
Never to open lightning with a bolt
Ask he said, and don't ever suppose
If you don't ask then nobody knows

Some eyes it's not

Another kind of damage that takes place beyond the torrent.
At first, it seemed as though she had only left
The room to go into the garden and had been delayed by stray
Chickens in the corn. Then he had thought she might
Have eloped with the rodeo-boy from the neighboring
Property but it wasn't till one afternoon, when he
Had heard guitar playing coming from her room and
Had rushed upstairs to confront her and had seen
That it was only the wind in the curtains brushing
Against the open strings, that he finally knew she
Wasn't coming back. He had dealt with the deluge alright
But the watermark of her leaving was still quite visible.
He had resorted to the compass then, thinking that
Geography might rescue him but after one week in the
Victorian Alps he came back north, realizing that snow which
He had never seen before, was only frozen water.

I knew what was happening

I knew that this was my world

I knew what was happening in my part of the world



There was an abandoned castle with empty chairs

There was a rumour pavarotti would sing there

To raise funds for a music school but then the

Whole thing vanished into thin air



It was a crazy idea

And it vanished into the air

It was a falling down castle with falling down stairs



I could walk the streets unrecognized

Nobody stopped me I was never surprised

By anybody's actions or by an ex-lover's eyes



And this felt good

And this felt so right

To be unloaded as I walked through the night



This felt good

This felt so right



To be unloaded as I walked through the night, this felt right

The Go-Betweens,"You sure gotta funny way 
 Of hanging on to the Babylon
 Of the always gone and getting it wrong 
 Because it makes no difference to anyone 
 That you had your fun in the burning sun
 When you thought you'd won
 And I like your weird way of drifting low
 In the underflow, try letting go 
 And then you'll know 
 'cause sometimes change is a dirty word 
 When you're in the herd, yeah that's what I heard
 Did your kitten purr?
 You sure gotta funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 You sure got a funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 Midnight and hauntings and nights on the fly
 Moonlight on moorings with you on my mind
 If you go a little crazy when the light is black 
 Get on a different track, find out what you lack 
 And you'll make it back
 And it sure seems strange here in Hollywood
 But I'm looking good, I'll put on my hood 
 And dream of Birnam Wood
 You sure gotta funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 You sure got a funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind",Going Blind,2000
The Go-Betweens,"He's got a four wheel drive that he takes to Double Island Point
He's got a relationship with a woman that he met in an Irish joint
I know the land 

And the colored sand
Everything's fresh at the source in this land
Everything's fresh at the source in this land
And I wish him luck
I hope he get's it right 
As he lives my live

He's got a house all to himself that overlooks a park
He's got a piano all to himself that he plays after dark
I know the sound 
As the sun goes down

Everything's fresh at the source as the sun goes down
Everything's fresh at the source as the sun goes down
And I wish him luck
I hope he get's it right 

As he lives my life
And if you see him 
Tell him I'll be him 
As I live his life",He Lives My Life,2000
The Go-Betweens,"How can I help you focus 
When all you do is choke us?
Try looking for me and wishing for me 
And kiss me softer than the rest
How can I help you dream 
When all you do is scream?
If I'm not allowed to be above the crowd
I don't want to be your guest
A one in a million smile
A silent number that I can't dial
But eyes so blue it's like falling through
An evening in the west 
What can I do to sway you?
Drop to my knees and pray you
Stop breathing the fumes of those other grooms
Then we really will be blessed
Ba, ba, ba there's ice around your heart
My home",Heart and Home,2000
The Go-Betweens,"Diamonds on the water at five o'clock
 Lovers lie around in tangled knots
 Pulling your picture from a cardboard box
 Forget you not, forget me not
 I don't want to change a thing when there's magic
 I don't want to change a thing when there's magic 
 In here, now the coast is clear 
 I got no time for fear
 Time knocks you down like a rolling ball
 In memory hall
 Love leaves you clean like a waterfall
 Then you hit a wall, hit a wall
 I don't want to change a thing when there's magic
 I don't want to change a thing when there's magic 
 In here, now the coast is clear 
 I got no time for fear",Magic in Here,2000
The Go-Betweens,"I hear you skating on the ice
And wonder why you left me twice
The eerie sound of blade on lake 
Cracks my skin and I fill with ache
But I don't want this heart 
I don't need this blood
I see you running through the grass 
A doctors daughter, a sky of glass
My swollen eye at Sunday school
No saviour here under God's bright rule
But I don't want this heart 
I don't need this blood
Time to be leaving, run from your reach
Gonna go dreaming on Orpheus Beach
I feel you breathing in my head
But better there if not in bed 
I wash your perfume from my clothes
I don't believe that affection goes
But I don't want this heart 
I don't need this blood
Time to be leaving, run from your reach
Gonna go dreaming on Orpheus Beach",Orpheus Beach,2000
The Go-Betweens,"I've got tickets 
 To the best show in town
 If you want to come on down and listen
 I'm ready
 And I might come along 
 With something that you've been missing
 I've got no money 
 I've got nothing at all
 But I'll keep you guessing
 And I'm bound 
 To hit the wall 
 And I'll be running 
 I'm no trouble
 I'm nothing like the trouble 
 That I used to be when I was somebody's double
 Do you have any whiskey?
 I don't like to drink 
 But I like to know that's it's along there with me
 There's nothing I've seen
 That's ever really 
 Flattened me
 And there's something 
 In the corner of your eye 
 That gets me
 Yes there's something 
 But I know 
 You'll keep me guessing 
 So what do you say 
 Tell me what you're thinking of 
 Tell me what you're thinking of this minute
 You're a spirit
 You're one thing greater 
 Than all the things that you are together
 You're one thing greater 
 Than all the things 
 You are together",Spirit,2000
The Go-Betweens,"We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines

Some good looking people wearing

Lee cooper jeans

They're breaking on the headland, they're breaking on the shore

And when you're living in hawaii they're breaking at your door



We used to wet our fingers on surfing magazines

Going to throw school and follow those scenes

Going to get a kombi and go from beach to beach

Be the kind of people the authorities can't reach



We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines

Wake up in the morning and the waves are clean

Standing on the headland taking in the scene

Just like they do it ... in surfing magazines

The Go-Betweens,"When she sang about angels
She looked at the sky 
Anybody else, anybody else, but I let it go by
When she sang about the fields 
She raised up her arm 
As if she was pushing back the cotton on some Midwestern farm
When she sang about a boy
Kurt Cobain 
I thought what a shame it wasn't about 
Tom Verlaine
When she sang about angels
She looked at the sky
Anybody else, anybody else, but I let it go by
Then she threw some names 
Like she always did 
She threw some names, she dropped some names 
like she used to when I was a kid
When she sang about angels
She looked at the sky
Anybody else, anybody else, but I let it go by
I let it go by
I let it go by",When She Sang About Angels,2000
The Go-Betweens,"Born to a family
a family of workers
Born to a family
of honest workers
 
Then I came along
golden boy who belonged
 
And changed the system
of honest workers
 
I was square into the hole
there was something in my soul 
 
What could I do
but follow the calling
What could I do 
but follow this calling
 
When I was five years old
Asked when I'd be old 
Did I have a plan
But I knew who I am
 
Born to a family",Born to a Family,2005
The Go-Betweens,"There's a boundary rider
at the five mile fence
bloodwood, bones + steers
 
And the sky's so deep
you can't find your sleep
keeps you walking through these tears
 
So you reach for things
you're never satisfied
you're running down the years
 
And to know yourself
is to be yourself
keeps you walking through these tears
 
Some days you ride it hard
to stop them getting out
then comes the day you ride
to stop them getting in
 
There's a boundary rider
on the five mile fence
bloodwood, bones + steers
 
And to know yourself
is to be yourself
keeps you walking through these tears.",Boundary Rider,2005
The Go-Betweens,"I opened a notebook, it read “The Darlinghurst Years”
I snapped it shut but out jumped some tears
I didn't have to read it, it all came back
Dragging my fingers through my hair
Hidding behind her back
 
Gut rot cappuccino, gut rot spaghetti
Gut rot rock'n'roll through the eyes of Frank Brunetti
And always the traffic, always the lights
Joe played the cello through those
Darlinghurst Nights
 
One more coffee and I must go
Back to my room more chapters to go 
We'll meet up in an alley with more places I know
 
I'm going to change my appearance everyday
I'm going to write a movie and then I'm going to star 
  in a play
I'm going to go to Caracas because you know I'm 
  just going to have to get away
 
Marjorie and Kim, Andy and Clint, Debbie, Bertie, people came and went 
And then there was Suzie who we never ever saw again
 
And always the traffic always the lights
Climbing that hill star studded nights
Joe played the cello
 
Alright.",Darlinghurst Nights,2005
The Go-Betweens,"What would you do if you turned around
And saw me beside you
Not in a dream but in a song?
Would you float like a phantom
Or would you sing along?

Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it's flowing
But I know it's finding you

What would you do
If you saw me driving by in a car
The quickest you've ever seen me spin?
Would you smile and wave
Or would you bow and get in?

Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it's flowing
But I know it's finding you

But then the lightning finds us
Burns away our kindness
We can't find a place to hide
Come the rainy season
Surrender to our treasons
Can we even find our tears?

Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it's flowing 
But I know it's finding you",Finding You,2005
The Go-Betweens,"Just pulled out of a train station we're moving sideways
I'm sitting here with three other people in the carriage
Passing churches, passing stations, a bustling complex
I see a sequence 22 rivers out my window
 
Pushing you away from me
Pushing you away from me
 
The skyscrapers the cloud scratchers 
Here comes a city
The sandwich maker the trollycar pusher 
Here comes a city
 
Pushing you away from me
Pushing you away from me
 
Etterzhausen, Frankfurt Central, here comes a city
And why do people who read Dostoevsky always look like Dostoevsky?
 
A crowded train, a silent night
The country's black and the cities are bright
 
On this flight, through the night
On this flight, historic night
 
Here comes a city",Here Comes a City,2005
The Go-Betweens,"Everybody said that she's good in bed
Other people said that she's well read
 
She's got a pair or black boots that kick stones
She's got black moods she calls her own
 
She's got Tasmania in the back of her head
A future move in her head
 
She's been to Sydney once, no more
They poisoned her water and nailed her door
 
She wears Lavender it's her scent
Lavender wherever she went",Lavender,2005
The Go-Betweens,"For days we fought across the globe
You bit my tongue on a Lisbon Road
We staggered home to the black hotel
Blew our money at the wishing well
December sun didn't make us sing
Wounds too deep to keep anything

But there's no reason to cry.

Been fifteen years since we last spoke
The wounds have healed on my throat
The autumn sun's a creamy haze
On Fox Hill Green I lose the day

But there's no reason to cry.",No Reason to Cry,2005
The Go-Betweens,"I blow the dust from your lips and beg forgiveness
But there's too much moonlight on your skin
I rise and face the day
Another weary sinner
I can't feel your touch in the blaze of noon

At night I haunt the boulevard
To the songs of Sacha
I need the touch of fingers on my skin
Then the sunrise seeks you through a maze of dragons
And drops its touch
On the fir trees in the wind

They say that ice will melt
Marble can blind you
Doesn't matter what you felt
No-one can find you 
To remind you

'Cause you're a statue nothing can hurt you
You've lost the touch
'Cause you're a statue nothing can hurt you
You've lost the touch

No-one can find you 
Or move you",The Statue,2005
The Go-Betweens,"I follow footprints to the edge of the moon
While the silver moves around the room
Your sister says your ship is sailing soon
Sighs and whispers from the red lagoon

Then the fire calls and the day blinds you
And a tower falls and the stars find you
This night's for you.

I find some feathers buried in the sand
I put them on and try to leave the land
Beyond the break horizons run unplanned
I wear your footprints tattoos in my hands

Then the fire calls and the day blinds you
And a tower falls and the stars find you
This night's for you",This Night's for You,2005
The Go-Betweens,"I lived in seclusion for a couple of years
In a German farmhouse just drinking beer
And every morning I'd wake up with a smile from ear to ear
I had one contact to the outside world

A phone in London and a seasick girl.
I knew what was happening but only in my part of the world
I knew what was happening 
I knew that this was my world

Found myself wanting to be sleeping
To be dreaming, to be worlds away

Slip into bed the sheets are cold and smooth
My tension melts to a quiet warm
Find myself waiting to be sleeping
To be dreaming, to be worlds away

I wanna be worlds away apart from the day to day
I know I'll be okay when I get worlds away
Worlds away, worlds away, worlds away, worlds away

Slipping away to somewhere in my heart
Go to a world where no one's been before
That's when I find myself not quite sleeping
But still dreaming and I'm worlds away

I wanna be worlds away apart from the day to day
I know I'll be okay when I get worlds away
Worlds away, worlds away, worlds away, worlds away

Worlds away
Worlds away
Worlds away

The Go-Go's,"Hey over there what's going on
Where I am they say you're wrong
When my sun is setting
Yours is breaking dawn
Say over there I want to talk

What do they teach you
How much have you bought
These days I feel too wise
I think we're sharing the same lies

[Chorus]
Beneath the blue sky
We're all alone together
The calm hides stormy weather
And if we stand apart
We'll kiss goodbye

Everybody wants to live
Their lives through

The Go-Go's,"I remember that day
Wind pushing birds around
Trees crashing against the window
Of a ghost hotel
I kissed you and swore I'd never tell
But you said it wasn't right
I remember that day
Rain pouring from the sky
Dashing down the boulevard
Watching the city from a tower
My head felt light
I knew I'd lost my heart
But I just said I hate heights
CHORUS
Why'd you say you loved me
That day, that day
When you new you wouldn't have me on
This day, this day
Now you're fine, I'm not okay
And I can only stay away
I can only kneel and pray
Try and try to forget that day
I remember the time
I left to get some work done
Wasn't looking for anyone
When out of nowhere you found me
And though now I know you love some other one
I can't forget the things you said",Forget That Day,1984
The Go-Go's,"Been running so long
I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs
I must be losin' it
Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know looks sometimes deceive
Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out
And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong

[Chorus]
Head over heels
Where should I go
Can't stop myself
Outta control
Head over heels
No time to think
Looks like
The whole world's out of sync

Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart

[Chorus]",Head over Heels,1984
The Go-Go's,"What you think of me is hard to tell
Double talkin' words that I can't spell
I don't want to read between your lies

You always run away with words
You're never seen once you've been heard

[Chorus]
I'm the only fool
That's as big a fool as you
Got the only heart
And it beats as hard as yours
I'm the only one you run to
The one you come to
The only one you can get to
I'm the only one-only one for you
Only one for you

There's no need to play this silly game
No one wins and nothing's ever gained
You'd think by now that maybe you would see
But you're as blind to love as you are to me
I'm all for one, you're one for all
I got the only number you should call

[Chorus]",I'm the Only One,1984
The Go-Go's,"I can hardly stand the thought of leaving again
 Can barely write the words I'm shakin' the pen

 You're outta my sight I'm outta my mind
 We never bargained or planned on this
 We gotta hold on hold on

 [CHORUS]
 I'm with you
 Hold me in your mind
 Keep the fire strong
 Without you
 Not really apart
 Our love goes on and on

 When we're together we pretend
 That we can take the time ''cause it'll never end
 It was so easy when love began
 We gotta hold on hold on

 Now I'm off another city in sight
 And I remember each and every night
 When I could touch you it felt so right
 that's why I hold on hold on

The Go-Go's,"He's crying inside
Can't tear the hurt out

She says:
I just wanted to make you
I never meant to break you
He says:
Have some mercy on me
Do you have to be
Such a mercenary

She's scheming inside
Can't stop the wheels turning
Been through it before

She's not really bad
Just a gold-plated heart
So scared to be alone
It rips her apart

The Go-Go's,"You act so tough
But I know what you're doing

That your heart's not made out of stone

[Chorus]
There may be some explanation
Why you feel the way you do
The world makes its rotations
But I just want to turn to you
Come on let me turn to you
Please let me turn to you
Why not let me turn to you
Just want to turn to you

It has a lot to do
With the fist time that we met
The wild dance in your eyes
Made up for what was never said

Because before you know it
We'll be down to our last dime

You're my idea of a pretty view
You can move or so it seems
I bet we'd make a decent team

I'm not asking for all your time
A song or two would suit me fine
I'm not asking for you to say
That you'll be with me all the way

Shut your mind off for a while
Concentrate on the latest style
And everything's alright

[Chorus]
Yes or no
I'll take it fast or slow
I'll make it easy for you to decide
Yes or no
You've got to let it go
Just take a stance
Either dance or tell me no

If you've got somewhere to be
If you've got someone besides me
Let me know don't put me on

All those familiar sounds

Dancin' in their empty arms
Tangled up in the lives of others
That don't make any sense

Their sins are innocent
Don't you stop to wonder
What's goin' wrong
When everything you've ever loved
Has come and gone

You thought and never told me
You thought but that won't hold me
So much was left unspoken
Held in a heart now broken

Situations all invented
A million in your head

Babe said, ""let's start something great""
We couldn't wait

Char said, ""I've gotta go non-stop
Gonna stay up 'til we hit the top""
Soon the other stiletto would drop
For the sweethearts of pop

Who knew we were going down
So careless with what we'd found
Making and breaking our daisy chain
Flowers bloom, they fade too soon
What happened to our daisy chain?

At number one not doing so fine
Still having some fun spilling the wine
The rising sun never felt too kind
We were out of our minds

Trying too hard to play the part
KV burned out like a shooting star
Been brought down by a broken heart
We were falling apart

Who knew we were going down
So careless with what we'd found
Making and breaking our daisy chain
Flowers bloom, they fade too soon

The lines were blurred the pace insane

Falling down, the fools are laughing
They know the reason, they can't be happy now
Great, what does it mean to be great? To feel like it every day

In the land of second places the rule of thumb is try not to say it
Just hold your tongue and say it nicely
You change the subject ever so politely now
True, what does it mean to be true? Feeling your point of view

Work, keep working on it, work, keep working on it
Sometimes it could feel just like we're almost done
Endless streams of repetition
It looks like we're all wishing for something different

Paint your brain a thousand colors
When every color outside is black and white
We don't know which way we're really going
Wait, I know the right way, please, just wait a second
Stop, shut up the children, I know where I am

Some things are easy and some irreplaceable

His scent swims around me
Like a perfume too heavy for summer
Me lost thing
Intoxicated
Curled within him
Drowning over and over

Charmed disarmed
He comes when least expected
Sits too close
Lingers too long
Stares too deeply
And claims me with something I cannot name

Lightheaded and clean
This is a gift
Biting tongue until blood
I am sick with him

Talk goes no deeper than tonight
Words are tickets to spend time
Skin is talking to skin
Loud

I know not to go too deep
But when his hands stop
Tremble, temptation
I thrill back
Open up
Crawl walls

This woman is no man's
This man is no one's
This one is mine

In a full room, alone on a couch
He is throned
Doesn't move
Knows I will come

Smitten
It vibrates
Makes drinks tremble
Food wastes time
Cigarettes are for curling smoke
And drawing me in

This is bloody business

Guilt makes for poor postcards
So he comes in for a while
What do we know of this?

Doesn't know if he'll be allowed to stay
But he looks a while too long
And stirs the close air
Dragging me to the bottom of the lake

Couches are for excuses
And temptation
Crushed in too deep to breathe
Swoon again skin you do not know
With hands that know too much
Of what you must never say

Flesh to curl to grind
To feign sleep to balance wishes
On tongues and wait for the time

Cozy he calls me
Says I smell like sweet cream
Closed eyes bring on a luscious film
Of time and silence

He tastes like stars
He feels like thunder

Regret makes you bitter
He says
Come in and swim

We disappear into a dusk
We'll never own
And never quite shake

A luscious slice
Of water
Lack of sleep makes me drift
Lake of sleep makes me wonder

He will exist
He will evaporate
I am sick with him, gone

In regret dreams he is low and sweet
Dark like a drift storm
Holding me down under the waves
Telling me not to talk
Not to move
This will only take an hour
Or two",Drown,1996
The Golden Palominos,"I eat only sleep and air
And everyone thinks I'm dumb
But I'm smart because I've figured it out.

I am slimmer than you are
And I am burning my skin off little by little
Until I reach bone and self
Until I get to where I am essential
Until I get to where I am

Food doesn't tempt me anymore
Because I am so full of energy and sense
I can even pass by water now
Because I am living off the parts of me
That I don't need anymore.

I could feel the slow drips of pain before,
Swirling inside where my lungs should have been.
Now I'm clean inside.

I threw out hundreds of things that I didn't need anymore.
All my dresses and bras
Stupid things like jeans and socks.
Most days I float through the house naked
So I can see myself in the mirrors.
I have hundreds of them everywhere
And they talk back to me all the time.
They keep me true and pure.
They make sure I'm still here.

When I knew what I had to do
I took all my notebooks, all my manuscripts
And ate them page by page
So I could take my words with me.

I can finally control my life and even death
And I will die slowly like steam escaping from a pipe.

This is my greatest performance
And all of the actresses who won my parts will say
How wonderful to let yourself go that mad,
How wonderful to go on this kind of journey
And not care if you come back to tell the story.

I scratch words on the walls now
So people will visit this museum and know
How someone like me ends up like this
(they'll say there is art in here somewhere).

Everything that comes out of me is sacred
Every tear, every cough, every piss.
Everything that comes off of me is sacred
Every fingernail, every eyelash, every hair.

Starvation is sacred and I scratch my bones
Against the windows at night.
I light candles and feel myself evaporate.
This body is a little church, a little temple.
You can't see me now because I've gone inside.

My family doesn't call anymore.
My friends don't call anymore.
You can't hurt me anymore.
They can't hurt me anymore.
Only I can.

And that's okay.
I don't need them anymore.
I can live off of me.
I speak to me.
I dance with me.
I eat me.

When they find me, I'll have a little smile on my face
And they'll wrap me in a white cloth and lay me in the ground
And say they don't understand.
But I do.
I don't hurt anymore.
I'm not lonely anymore.
I'm not sad I'm not pretty anymore.
I made it through.

I feel so holy and clean when I stretch out on the floor and sing.
Sometimes god comes in for a minute and says I'm doing fine, I'm almost there.

Every day I get a little closer to vanishing.
Some days I can't stand up because the room moves under my feet
And I smile because I'm almost there,
I'm almost an angel.

One day when I am thin enough
I'll go outside
Fluttering my hands so I can fly
And I will be so slight that I will pass through all of you

Now you're just left to wonder
How she sized you up in three minutes or under
She's out of your league, you're out of your mind

Things only feel true
When someone's abusing you
You are sometimes startled you are never surprised

There are only two speeds: fast and faster,
Now you're lashed to mast and lashed to master
Whether you're in bed or in court, everybody gets off

So she smokes to keep from eating
And you fuck her to keep from feeling
And this is a taste, and this is a waste
And these are all of your days sacrificed

You're rocking out in an empty room
You've built your house, it's become your tomb
Mmm thanks, she says, I'll keep my options open

Now you're nervous with hope, nervous with fear
She's barely gone, and you're barely here
Here comes the cocaine wake up call

And like a boy, not a slave to fame
You kissed lipstick only after money came
Born in New York 30 years ago, you've died several times since

Drive through tunnels and crawl through caves,
And suffer through a life no city can save
They've got an unmarked car with your name on it

So she smoked to keep from eating
And you fucked her to keep from feeling
And that was a taste, and that was a waste
Now these are all of your days magnified

Style over content. You know the other
Keep slugging it out in the superstructure
If you love something, chances are you can't afford it

Forget what's ahead and what's past
And live every day as if it were the last
The dead man never knows he's dead",Ride,1996

Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow,

There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide

With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
You heart gets stolen by some mousey little girl

And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you a line

The plastic pretenders to paradise speak
Of your fictions of triumph and legends of pain
The sense that you'd left you'd be back once again
There's a glint in your eyes and the sky starts to laugh
It's two to one you never did things by half
And I'm out on the rooftops yelling your name
Cos without you this town will be too much the same

You went driving in the rain
I'll never see you again
There's nothing in the air left to compare
To all of your passion and genius pain
You went driving in the rain
I'll never see you again

There was talk of an illness that came by surprise
The papers did penance, the whole town took sides
Oh, but it was your dancing and mischeivous mind
And then we were shot of you, but no-one's that blind
And there's flowers have bloomed down the side of your street
Where you and your demons did openly meet
And I hope it's wide open where you've got to
There's closed minds in this town that couldn't accept you

(chorus)

They're making excuses, the reasons the facts
They're reasoning how long you'll take to come back
But there's guilt in their prayers, maybe shame in their pride
They know it was no fault of yours down inside
They steps can't be retraced cos tracks disappear
And there'd be no welcome for you back here
Because you were the worst side of everyone's soul
They had to get rid or face up to the cold

The Good Liars,"There are so many sides to every story
And this is mine
A dirty pair of hands sometimes has to come clean
And now is the time
I just couldn't see love's great defection
Now it's flourishing in one dimension
Love went over the wall
Was it pushed or did it fall? 

The official story was a 60/40 split
Cut with a knife
But now that I'm ghostwriting your autobiography
This ought to be your life
You wouldn't have to be a great detective
To see the things you do to me are self-reflexive
They bounce right back from me
Cos I'm a human trampoline

Seem now, it's so hard to take
Heart to hearts that were heart for heart's sake
Now cupid only watches darts
Love is just the sum of it's parts

Together we were a perfect circle
I think that we should get back again
I'll hold you close and we'll roll all the way
Down to lover's lane
We're just two sides of a vulgar fraction
Waiting for a little love interaction
When the borderline will fall
Without you I mean half of nothing at all

Looking back it seems like fake
Heart to hearts that were heart for hearts sake
I should have known right from the start
I want you know, I want the fake
I learnt the laws and found it's just give and take
(you give and I take)
I've got the guts, I will restart
And love is only the sum of it's parts
Love is the sum of it's parts
Yes it is.

The Good Liars,"It's so easly to forgo, so hard to forget
So hard for to realise that I'm not dead yet
When everything that we wanted is beyond beyond
And all that I hoped for is long dead gone

So how can I sleep in this memory bed
Where I feel like a grave with a tomb for a bedhead
With your name and my name carved deep in the stone
Now faded away cos we're long dead gone

We're long dead gone, long dead gone
Now faded away because we're long dead gone

And love lies bewildered, checking its pulse
To see if it compares to anything else
And two things still beating, but never as one
And one thing lies choking cos it's long dead gone

So here rests in pieces
Whatever it was that we could admit to
Whatever it was that was me and you

So why won't I just let it die and get rid
Of the truth that we both would've rather kept hid
Better to live a lie than pretend that you're not
And to live out a love that is long dead gone

It's long dead gone, long dead gone
Don't live out a love which is long dead gone
Never live out a love that is long dead gone
Don't live out a love which is long dead gone

The Good Natured,"Bah Humbug, now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year
Ski shop encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls Trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens Sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat
Could I join him?
No This time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks No party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year

""Any of you fucking pricks move
And I'll execute every motherfucking last one of you!""

Me and Fast got the gats, we're out to rob a bank 
We got Steve outside, carrying a full pack 
Now everything's cool and everthing's smooth 
I walked up to the teller, I gave her the letter 
She gave me the loot with puckered up lips 
And a wink that I found cute, and I said,
""Baby, baby, baby""
(Is this some Kharmic-Chi love thing happening here baby or what) 
By that time Fast tapped me with the nine
He said it's time to blow, ya know, so out the door we go 
Back to the ride with Steve inside and alive, off we drive 
See, I hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far
Riding around in a stolen police car
So we dropped it off and piled in a Caddy 
Steve was driving 'cause I had to talk to my man about something 

""Look, I don't know anything about any fucking set-up
You can torture me all you want""
""Torture you, that's good, that's a good idea, I like that one""

And I don't give a fuck about the hell's gate
Ain't punkin' the crowd and I'm still standing up straight
So, we pull these jobs to make a little money
No one gets hurt if they don't act funny

On the way to the yacht, we almost got caught
Fast is shooting mailboxes, not knowing where the cop is, yeah
They're at the Dunkin Donuts, adjacent from the Fromans
Whose mailbox Fast had just exploded

They gave chase, but my man Steve's an ace
And we lost those brothers with haste
We casted off and along we went
Off Bermuda to an island resort we rented

"The Good, the Bad & the Queen","When the hard day come from the magical lamp 
That you saw there 
And you can't get home 
It doesn't compare 
You got all love and war 
When you are all uptight with fever inside 
Let's get out 
And if we can't do that what do you say 
Let the past pass away 

Into the dawn of another way of looking at 
The people we've become 

To a place where we played when 
We were young on the cool 
Breeze behind the sun 

When the genes dissented and the hammer fell 
Reliving 
The force of the feeling that got you so down 
Will you ever forgive me 
It was a perfect night 
And I wanted to say 
I love you 
And when the flood comes down I'll carry you and let the 
Past pass away 

Into the dawn of another way of looking at

"The Good, the Bad & the Queen","I wrote this song years ago late at night somewhere on the Goldhawk Road
I was never sure how or why
Before the war and the tidal wave engulfed us all it's true how the world has changed
And I was learning how to change with you

We saw the green fields
Turn into stone
Such lonely homes
All in a badman's dream
He ain't asleep
It's just a dream

In the darkest hour the song had gone it passed among the people I hardly knew
And I was losing it all the time
But she stayed with me and found me out and above all things I've learnt
It's that honesty that secures the bond in the heart

We don’t care because we’re all animal lovers
We like to share our lives with them

Is a case for love
When everything else
That keeps us together conspiring to tear us apart

At the point where the sky and the earth touch
Is the head of the Unicorn
Nailed to the wheel in the middle of the town
Is the nightingale alone
Singing ‘where have you put me
I gave no signed consent
I’d rather keep my place here
I put up with your rents’

So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Where she had done a dozen favors

To get me out of dutch

And a forty-gallon still.

The other watched the spout
And momma corked the bottles
When ol' Dooley fetched them out.

Dooley, trying to make a dollar
Dooley, give me a swaller
I'll pay you back some day.

Slipping through the woods
Dooley kept behind them all
He never lost his goods.
Dooley was a trader
When into town he'd come
Sugar by the bushel
And molasses by the tub.

The men stood around and cried.

He lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him
And a barrel for a stone.

In the vain of my reflection
In the ruin of its remarks

Can you do without me?

I know we've had our doubts, our sun is setting now
Who said it's over cause baby I can't live without you,
Can you live without?

You and me and our debris
And everything that made it seem
Like you and me supposed to be
The envy of most everything and now
What's wrong?

How could we never try, to see each others side?
I was so wrong but baby everybody hurts
And you hurt me sometimes

How can we stitch it up, the scars, the wounds, the cuts?
Are we so broken and bruised that we can't feel the love
The love that started with

You and me and our debris
And everything that made it seem
Like you and me supposed to be

The Graduate,"Don't shut me out
I don't wanna live inside your lost and found
You spin a story
With every other word you say
Another lie convincing me to stay

You only listen to my stare
And until I'm crushed beyond repair

So do you care enough
To hold on, it's been so long
You keep pulling on the strings
Till I'm undone, all at once

Don't cut me off
Until you help me find a way
To live with the loss

You've got me wound up too tight
Don't catch on till it's too late
Keep me moving like a moth to flame
Zoom by you at first sight
Every time I try to get away
Something new's convincing me to stay

So do you care enough
To hold on, it's been so long
You keep pulling on the strings
Till I'm undone, all at once

Don't cut me off
Until you help me find a way
To live with the loss

Could I have changed it
What more could I have sacrificed
There's always something to say
Stop me before I go to waste

Play with my love
Rip it up till I say enough

So do you care enough
To hold on, it's been so long
You keep pulling on the strings
Till I'm undone all at once

Don't cut me off
Until you help me find a way
To live with the loss

",All At Once,2010
The Graduate,"Leave all your clothes buried in the sand
Who knows when we'll be coming back again
Come on in, man, the water's getting cold
See if you sink or swim or float

When the tide came in we tried to act surprised
What could the ocean want
With the things that we left behind
Swimming back to land and I realized
It was the only time that year I felt alive

We booked a one way going overseas
Feels like I'm living someone else's dream
I tried my best to keep from turning back
I'm scared, you may have been my better half

Oh, I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke
I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke

And the story ends the same as it began
I never know when I'll be coming around again
Staring at the sand I realized
It was the only time that year that I felt alive

I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke
I'm on the edge about to choke
About to choke, about to choke

",Choke,2010
The Graduate,"One more sign taking shape
This could be my undoing

And I can't wait to be there
When all my bided time and dragging
Through my days comes to an end

Just a phase and we will finally
See the truth in everything
We can't explain

All of my dreams are filling a cesspool
So many things I couldn't handle
We are corrupt to the core
This guilt is gonna fill me up till I overflow

Still I want more that I can't win
Make this bided time and dragging
Through my days, come to an end

Such a shame that we may never
See the truth in everything
We can't explain

'Cause hope has never been enough
To be sure is asking for too much
Everything I try seems so impossible
Everything I have would be enough
For someone else but I want more

I can't win
Make this bided time and dragging
Through my days, come to an end

Such a shame that we may never
See the truth in everything
We can't explain

This could be my undoing

The Graduate,"In a you alone
Tied me up against a sinking stone
Cracking when I bend
Shouldered by the moon, the sun, the wind

How dare they break the news
Can't they see I'm sore through every pain
Clearly too involved
Just waiting for the next turn to get off

Let me hear you say again
Nothing innocent is ever planned
Let me hear you say again
Nothing decent is ever planned

",For the Missing,2010
The Graduate,"I lost control
Careening all directions
Just don't know where to go
Come, turn me on
There's light inside me somewhere
I just don't know where to go

Sold out of state
And out of mind

I'm still lonely with you
Still only hanging on
Time is passing by
And nothing seems
To change my mind
I'm still lonely with you

Play by the rules
And all you do is lose
Just don't know where to go
I'm not convinced
Cold is slowly building thicker skin
Today I'm taking back my loneliness

So move me slow
Even though I'm only halfway there

I'm still lonely with you
Still only hanging on
Time is passing by
And nothing seems
To change my mind

I'm still lonely with you
Still only hanging on
Time is passing by
And nothing seems to change

Don't waste my time
Everything you do
Has got me out of state
And out of mind
If you'd only let me through
I will meet you on the other side

I lost control
Careening all directions
Just don't know where to go

I'm still lonely with you
Still only hanging on
Time is passing by
And nothing seems
To change my mind

I'm still lonely with you
Still only hanging on
Time is passing by

No one is listening
You can fool everyone outright
No one's paying attention

When nobody tells the truth
They're talking through their teeth

Our heads are spinning around
We don't like it underneath the ground
Yeah, our heads are spinning around

Only feeling with our hands

I woke to the engine stop
Plan a course outside
Just to get caught up
By every obstacle along the way

So much to explain
And only a single day
To plead my case
There's nothing else to do
Just hope it's not too late

For far too long I kept you in the dark
Can't believe it took so long to start

How can I find you now
'Cause it feels like time is running out
And I said when I left
That I would not ever let you down
Gotta find my way back somehow

I am much older now
And I feel like time is running out
When we get to the end
Can you promise that you'll be around
If I make you that promise now

Back out on the endless road
That's become my home
This entire year
On the lamb has shown me
All the more that this is in my blood

I don't mean to alarm
But the past two months
Have left me hysterical
It's time for something new
I get crazy without you

And all along we tried to keep apart
Can't believe it took so long to start

How can I find you now
'Cause it feels like time is running out
And I said when I left
That I would not ever let you down
Gotta find my way back somehow

I am much older now
And I feel like time is running out
When we get to the end
Can you promise that you'll be around
If I make you that promise now

Driving back to our town
Take it slow, keep it down
Put this mess in the ground
Just my love, you came around
Now it seems we'll let it shine
Mine and yours, yours and mine

Driving back to our town
Take it slow, keep it down
Put this mess in the ground
Just my love, you came around

",Permanent Tourists,2010
The Graduate,"Can't see the path ahead
But I can smell the rain
Hide beneath the canopy
I never would complain

Eyes on the sky
We see the darkness start to grow
We could build a fire
Or just wait to drive

Either way I'm fine
I'm alive, I'm home

We traded everything
And left the country side
Metal towers, skylines
Over lucid starlit nights

Found a north side neighborhood
That we could call our own
I'm just fine, I'm alive
I am home

I'm falling over edges with you
I'm longing just to see your face again
I'm taking on the world to give you
Everything you need while I'm away

All our friends in our hometown
They don't call us anymore
I can't remember feeling less alone
When you call me yours

I'm falling over edges with you
I'm longing just to see your face again
I'm taking on the world to give you
Everything you need while I'm away

I'm falling over edges with you
I'm longing just to see your face again
I'm taking on the world to give you
Everything you need while I'm away

I pack my things at night
While you sleep
You could never stand
To watch me leave

Wake up with the sun, pull me in
And I'm in love
With the whole world again

I'm falling over edges with you
I'm longing just to see

I'm falling over edges with you
I'm longing just to see your face again

These drinks are strong
And I hope one of these days
I'll learn to make it on my own

Not feeling strong enough
It's too complicated to settle up
But one of these days
I'll learn to make it on my own

How could I know
How could I know
I never should have let you go

So what's the point in waking up
When everything around me is falling
I'm stuck inside my head and can't get out
Can you hear me now

What's the point in waking up
When you are not around and I'm calling
For someone just to help me find the ground
So I can come back down

I stared into the light
Made more mistakes than I care to explain
Or even want to let you know

I'm feeling stronger now
I wish I could make it up somehow
'Cause I cannot stand another day alone

I should have known
I should have known
But still I let you go

So what's the point in waking up
When everything around me is falling
I'm stuck inside my head and can't get out
Can you hear me now

What's the point in waking up

I am moving on
Oh, won't you send me off
I know I can be loved again
Hear me now, I'm calling out

And watch your corner pain
Say'in nothing
Nothing's gonna change
Why is the world so damn unkind
To one so righteous in her mind

Will you never find your peace of mind

To play the kind of role the job required
Instead of trying he retired
What so much here to conquer
To feel a long while so-called friends don't phone
You know the pain is not their own

Grow a little more in grain
And watch your corner pain
Say'in nothing
Nothing's gonna change
Why is the world so damn unkind
To one so righteous in her mind
The sun won't rise and shine
Will you never find your peace of mind

To feel the tension hiding in these walls
You see a trace of spirit fall

But now he's back to find his place again
Sorry but the book's been burned

 And take what I could take 
 You thought you'd found yourself a dream that wouldn't end 
 The moment you awake 
 I don't want any strings, you'd say to me 
 Again and again, somehow I still believed 
 That even while I was reading you between the lines 
 I could see me running blind 
 I spent too many of my days too far away 
 And felt the toll it takes 
 And only learned how much you're capable of pain 
 And who's the first it breaks 
 I've had too many strings, you'd say to me 
 It hurts too much to break them when the feelings leave 
 Much as I thought I'd met the problem eye to eye 
 I could see me running blind

 They make them every day

We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
Fill him a jug and he'd pass it around

They were looking, tryin' to book him

Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
Took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue

And give all that love you've been denying

You've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
You've been looking for love
All the wrong faces
Gotta get 'cha girl
Off this illusion
Gonna save your heart
From all this confusion

Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl you got to give in
Sooner or later, love is gonna let 'cha
Sooner or later, love is gonna win
Love is gonna win

Its just a matter of time
Before you make up your mind
And give all the love that you've been hiding
Its just a question of when
Told you time and again
I'll get all the love you've been denying

Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl you got to give in
Sooner or later, love is gonna let 'cha
Sooner or later, love is gonna win",Sooner or Later,1972
The Grass Roots,"Darlin' darlin' 
If I could have you to call my very own 
I work my fingers to the bone, I am alone 
To you I'd always come home 

'Cause there's something about you, baby 
That makes me keep loving you 
There's something about you, baby 
Makes me love you just a little bit more 
Truly does, just a little bit more 

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied 
Sweet sweet thing, you set my soul on fire 
I need you, yeah, badly 
I know what price I have to pay 
'Cause without you, darlin', I'd worry hard 
I love you anyway 

'Cause there's something about you, baby 
That makes me keep loving you 
There's something about you, baby 
Makes me love you just a little bit more 
Truly does, just a little bit more 

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied 
Sweet sweet thing, you're my only desire 

I'm just yours puppet on a string 
And tears sometimes it brings 
Do me any way you wanna when you wanna 
I'll keep you just the same 

'Cause there's something about you, baby 
That makes me keep loving you 
There's something about you, baby 
Makes me love you just a little bit more 
Truly does, just a little bit more 

You're a real heartbreaker 
You will never let me sit down 
There's something about you, baby 
That shakes me all up inside 
You're a real heartbreaker 
But I need you just the same 

 

 

 
",Something About You,1975
The Grass Roots,"She's got something that moves my soul
And she knows I'd love to love her
But she lets me down every time
Can't make her mine she's no-one's lover
Tonight with me she'll be so inviting
I want her all for myself

Temptation eyes looking through my-my-my soul
Temptation eyes, you got to love me
Got to love me tonight

Her wild-eyed innocence is just a game
But just the same my head is spinnin'
She's got a way to keep me on her side
It's just a ride that's never ending
Tonight with me she'll be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Temptation eyes looking through my-my-my soul
Temptation eyes, you got to love me
Got to love me tonight

Tonight with me she'll be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Temptation eyes looking through my-my-my soul
Temptation eyes, you got to love me
Got to love me tonight",Temptation Eyes [Original],1985
