Cheap Trick,"Yesterday feels like running away
Feels like givin' the child gettin' lost losin' my mind
I'm feelin' low and I got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up yeah yeah
Oh yesterday feels like running away
And I know, I'm givin' up my time to still love 
Still love love's got me blind
My mind sees the things I don't know and I got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up

That limp wristed two-fisted diplomat
Better draw a map, to see where he's at
Around and round when he rambles on

For eternal youth from those swiss docs.
He's thirty but he feels like sixteen

Wasn't long tall sally it was no surprise
That's right, tell me that's right
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news
That night, tell me that's right
The band was singin' and playin' a tune
Love comes a-tumblin' down, oh yeah yeah

All shook up and bent out of shape
Wasn't Johnny B. Goode but it sounded great
That night, tell me that's right
From the cabaret to the highway of hell
Had a monkey on his back it was easy to tell
That night, tell me that's right

I'm wishing to live longer aided by the supreme healing force of music

I'm convinced it's an addiction, too. I feel just great again

Then you'll know what to do

You're the world's greatest lover and you're mine.

I know what I want, and I know how to get it from you, from you.

About the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves
Behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth

About the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love
We could save the world

And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin

Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
But I find myself in places with names but no faces

My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

Cheater,"When the earth was still flat, and the clouds made of fire
And mountains stretched up to the sky, sometimes higher
Folks roamed the earth like big rolling kegs
They had two sets of arms, two sets of legs
They had two faces peering out of one giant head
And they could watch all around them
And they talked while they read
And they never knew nothing of love
It was before the origin of love
Origin of love

And there were three sexes then
One that looked like two men glued back to back
Called the children of the sun
And similar in shape and girth were the children of the earth
They looked like two girls rolled up in one
And the children of the moon were like a fork shoved on a spoon
They were part sun, part earth, part daughter, part son
Origin of love

Now the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance
And Thor said:
""I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer
Like I killed the giants.""
And Zeus said:
""No, you better let me use my lightning, like scissors
Like I cut the legs off whales
And dinosaurs into lizards.""
Then he grabbed up some bolts
And he let out a laugh, said:
""I'll split them right down to the middle
Gonna rip them right in half.""
And then storm clouds gathered above
Into great balls of fire

And the fire shot down
From the sky in bolts
Like shining blades of a knife
And it ripped right through the flesh
Of the children of the sun
And the moon, and the earth
And some Indian god
Sewed the wound up into a hole
Pulled it 'round to our belly
To remind us of the price we pay
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile
Gathered up a big storm
To blow a hurricane
To scatter us away
In a flood of wind and rain
And a sea of tidal waves
To wash us all away
And if we dont behave
They'll cut us down again
And well be hopping round on one foot
Looking through one eye

Last time I saw you
We had just split in two
You were looking at me, and I was looking at you
You had a way so familiar
But I could not recognize
'Cause you had blood on your face
And I had blood in my eyes
But I could swear by your expression
That the pain down in your soul
Was the same as the pain down in mine
That's the pain
Cuts a straight line down through the heart
We call it love
So we wrapped our arms around each other
Trying to shove ourselves back together
We were making love
It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago
When by the mighty hand of Jove
It was the sad story
How we became lonely two-legged creatures

Cheater,"I've got a sweet tooth
for licorice drops and jelly roll,
Hey sugar daddy,
Hansel needs some sugar in his bowl.
I'll lay out fine china on the linen
And polish up the chrome
and if you've got some sugar for me,
Sugar Daddy, bring it home.

Black strap molasses,
you're my orange blossom honey bear.
Bring me Versace blue jeans
and black designer underwear.
We'll dress up like the disco-dancing
jet set in Milan and Rome.
And if you've got some sugar for me,
Sugar Daddy, bring it home.

Oh the thrill of control,
like the rush of rock and roll,
is the sweetest taste I've known. Oh yah
so come on, Sugar Daddy, bring it home.

When honey bees go shopping
it's something to be seen.
They swarm to wild flowers
and get nectar for the queen.
And everything you bring me
got me dripping like a honeycomb
and if you've got some sugar for me,
Sugar Daddy, bring it home.

Oh the thrill of control,
like the Blitzkrieg on the roll,
is the sweetest taste I've know oh yah.
If you've got some sugar
bring it home.Bah bah dabba dabba dabba do
Come on, Sugar Daddy, bring it home! 

Whiskey and French cigarettes,
a motorbike with high-speed jets,
a Waterpik, a Cuisinart
and a hypo-allergenic dog.
I want all the luxuries of the modern age,
and every item on every page
in the Lillian Vernon catalogue.

So you think only a woman
can truly love a man.
Well you buy me the dress
I'll be more woman
than a man like you can stand.
I'll be your Venus on a chocolate clam shell
rising on a sea of marshmallow foam
and if you got some sugar for me,
Sugar Daddy, bring it home.

It's our tradition to control,
like Erich Honecker and Helmut Kohl, 
remember him
from the Ukraine to the Rhone.
Sweet home uber alles,
Lord, I'm coming home.yah
Come on, Sugar Daddy, bring me home.",Sugar Daddy,1999
Cheater,"Don't you know me Kansas City?
I'm the new Berlin wall 
Try and tear me down!

I was born on the other side
Of a town ripped in two
I made it over the great divide
And now I'm coming for you

Enemies and adversaries
They try and tear me down
You want me baby, I dare you
Try and tear me down

I rose from off of the doctor's slab
Like Lazarus from the pit
Now everyone wants to take a stab, and decorate me
Blood, graffiti and spit

Enemies and adversaries
They try and tear me down
You want me baby, I dare you
Try and tear me down

On August 13th, 1961
A wall was erected down the middle of the city of Berlin
The world was divided by a Cold War
And the Berlin wall was the most hated symbol of that divide
Reviled, graffitied, spit upon
We though the wall would stand forever
And now that it's gone
We don't know who we are anymore
Ladies and gentleman Hedwig is like that wall!
Standing before you in the divide
Between east and west
Slavery and freedom
Man and woman
Top and bottom
And you can try to tear her down
But before you do, you must remember one thing!

There ain't much of a difference
Between a bridge and a wall
Without me right in the middle, babe
You would be nothing at all

Enemies and adversaries
They try and tear me down
You want me baby, I dare you
Try and tear me down",Tear Me Down,1999
Cheater,"You know the sun is in your eyes
And hurricanes and rain
And black and cloudy skies

You're running up and down that hill
You turn it on and off at will
There's nothing here to thrill 
Or bring you down

And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town

Oh Lady Luck has led you here
But they're so twisted up
They'll twist you up I fear

The pious, hateful, and devout
You're turning tricks till you're turned out
The wind so cold it burns
You're blowing out and burning 'round

And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town

The Fates are vicious and they're cruel
You learn too late you've used
Two wishes like a fool

And then you're someone you are not
And Junction City ain't the spot
Remember Mrs. Lot and
When she turned around

And when you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town",Wicked Little Town,1999
Cheater,"Forgive me for I did not know
'Cause I was just a boy
You were so much more

Than any God could ever plan
More than a woman or a man
And now I understand how much I took from you

'Cause when everything starts breaking down
You pick the pieces off the ground
And show this wicked town something
Beautiful and new

You think that luck has left you there
But maybe there's nothing
Up in the sky but air

And there's no mystical design
No cosmic lover pre-assigned
There's nothing you can find that cannot be found

And with all the changes you've been through
It seems the stranger's always you
Alone again in some new
Wicked little town

And when you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town

It's a wicked
Little town

Good bye wicked
Little town",Wicked Little Town (Reprise),1999
Cheater,"On nights like this
When the world's a bit amiss
And the lights go down
Across the trailer park
I get down, I feel had
Feel on the verge of going mad
Then it's time to punch the clock:

I put on some make-up
Turn on the tape deck
And put the wig back on my head
Suddenly I'm Miss Midwest Midnight Checkout Queen
Until I go home, and I put myself to bed

I look back from where I'm from
Look at the woman I've become
And the strangest things seem 
Suddenly routine
I look up from my Vermouth on the rocks
The giftwrapped wig still in the box
Of towering velveteen:

I put on some make-up
Some LaVern Baker
And pull the wig down from the shelf
Suddenly I'm Miss Beehive 1963
Until I wake up
And I turn back to myself

Some girls, they got natural ease
They wear it any way they please
With their French flipped curls
And perfumed magazines
Wear it up, let it down
This is the best way that I've found
To be the best you've ever seen:

I put on some make-up
Turn on the eight-track
I'm pulling the wig down from the shell
Suddenly I'm Miss Farrah Fawcett from TV
Until I wake up
And I turn back to myself

Shag, bi-level, bob
Dorothy Hamill 'do
Sausage curls, chicken wings
It's all because of you
With your blow-dried, feather backed
Toni home wave too
Flip, fro, frizz, flop
It's all because of you it's
ALL because of you it's
ALL because of you

Okay, everybody:
I put on some make-up
Turn on the eight-track
I'm pulling the wig down from the shelf
Suddenly I'm Miss Punk Rock Star of Stage and Screen
And I ain't never
I'm never turning back!",Wig in a Box,1999
Cheatham,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch

Cheb Mami,"I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall",Desert Rose,1999
Cheb Mami,"How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again?
Love is pain I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
I'm starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
We're starting up a brand new day
It could happen to you,
Just like it happened to me,
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee.
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero Mac
I'm begging her to take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
We're starting up a brand new day
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm the bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I'm the plough and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm the flagpole to your nation
I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
And go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle

Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl

J'essaye de regarder les choses en face, mec, mais je vois rien,
Tu sais je trace, plus je cherche du taffe, plus on me traite de vaut-rien,
En deux-mille quatre, nouvelle année, toujours les même résolutions,

Ils voudraient que j'accepte de vivre avec le SMIC, de grec et de KFC, 
De mettre un croix sur le classe E, 
Parce-que j'ai la peau mâte, a leurs yeux je suis dangereux
Parce que moi je viens faire le sbeul avec l'as,
Ils voudraient que j'accepte de voir dans la faim, mes voisins africains mourir, 
J'ai la liberté de penser, mais pas la liberté d'agir, (c'est ça)
Que j'accepte ou pas, c'est la même, j'ai beau criser,
T'auras beau tiser leur bière minéralisée, (c'est ça)

Four MCs, four minds combined in rhyme(x3)

And it goes,like this
I'll take it straight to that face plate
Snatch and make it detach (what now)
Cause what i bring's the natural dispatch
I'm magical
Word up, I got It like that
I'm just sayin what's on my mind 
When I rhyme
And that's the bottom line
Heavy stress got a nigga thinkin that he must be trippin
I'll be runnin rings around the rhymes that they be whippin
And they know it
But still they must be frontin
Cause I'm sayin somethin
That they don't want to hear
So now there's nothin (nothin)
But opposition to my every way of life
I'm sayin I'm a bring it on cause I must
Yo I'm bustin rhymes 
Cause its fresh when you def with linguistic, artistic
I mean this rap thing, is the shit kid (word up)
Gettin paid is a priority
No Doubt
So run that route
Well quit the runnin at the fuckin mouth
Yo It'll never be the same, like it use to be
Too many half steppers that want to be up in the industry
So yo i drop some science every demo i make
It's like, how you livin homes
Kinda trife and it ain't that great
I want to mansion and a yacht and all that bullshit
The niggas compromise they own integrity to get it
Now maybe that's the price to be paid for the riches
Sell your fuckin soul to the Devil
Now those suns a bitches (word)
Are tryin to tell me that my rhymes is to abbrasive and aggressive (what?)
My street warrior attitude ain't impressive

I move onto the scene like a graphic
I flow like traffic
I'm at my peak each and ever hour
When I get a rush
I gotta bust with the midas touch
Grab a hold of the steal an grip it with the camels clutch
Let em feel
Hear and bear witness
As I reveal the sickness
That's been quaratined and revealed
When I redeam
By Red who's One with creation
In time in this space
And rhymin a nation
Forever chasin
Hip Hop
Until da final act of death
Takes my last breath
Odesables of saren vega make me go def
With nothin left
But the force that creates life
Which is the soul
Takes me to the next life
Where I will still rock your bone
The side is told
But not believe
Its the grasp and behold
The energy they envy
Manafested in me
>From the donnig of time
'Till the dusk of eternity
Def scripts there will only be

We move like clockwork
Individual gears movin in sync
Condition
And executed with procision
The regular recital of rhymes remains
One of the many mechanisms used to escersize the brain
So stay wise
To the hands of time
Because they don't stop
Hip Hop, you don't stop (stop)
At the top of the hour
Checkmate sets it
Red-1 renegade
Revolves with the record
Clockwise
Retro grave rotation
Known to be not wise
Open your eyes
Before the alarm sounds
Countdown, the year 2000
The path gets dramatic
Time to drop mathematics
I figure
Four MCs in a circular configure-ation
Is an eventuall progression
Time is of the essence
Its the essence of this profession
To help make suggestions
Evolve from shadows
The day is now digital
Whatever the means
Times is still critical
So don't clock this work
But take it for what its worth
Clockwork
So syncronize your inc and rise
don't blink your eyes
Cause we're on the brink of demeise
So sit and re-think the lies
Flipout, is what would describe me best
So let me Flipout
and take this mess from my chest
Clockwork
Movin like the hands of time
Four MCs combined together in rhyme

Its like clockwork

But the clerk at the counter be the misfit
Spellin out rhymes from the mind
So check it
If you want to get jerked by the collar
Then gettin pulled from behind
The Misfit (Misfit)
You try to holla at the boys
Checkmate, Red, Flipout
Yes, indeed Misfit
So instead I think you should step
To the side (to the side)
And just listen to the brothas that be on the ride glide
An back an forth
Like an up rock from a fresh foot
Indeed I will come at ya jaw
And kick ya down with the shit that is coming
Compound

Me and the track
You can't ever turn back
Whack

I never stand still
Yes indead
As I kill another rhyme
You play potential
Kinetic, the man be electric
Electrifying suckers
That think they can defy tha man Misfit
I reach down deep in to the abis
And pull a rhyme to hit ya stiff quick
And that's the way it go
The impact of a firm fist
And like I said before
The dreaded brothas from the northwest (northwest)
Givin you the flow
Like Clock Work
Everyday it goes spontanious
When we bust
An that's the shit

I told you its like Clockwork
You know
Everyday flow

Cheech Marin,"I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!
So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared

Eighty five north of Atlanta, home of the Gwinnett County Braves
Out-of-towners looking out of place 'round here
Think it's sweet and disappear without a trace
Cops on the dash see the plates out of state
Apartment complex got a gate but it ain't 
Safe tryna hustle 'round here think there's money to be made
You'll get robbed by somebody underage
We don't rock brands like Vans, only J's
We don't use words like hella or the bomb

Better pay attention when you're pitching in the ballpark
'Cause

So they telling everybody they got it, that shit was short-lived
Jack boys get work, kick your door in
Talk to you on the phone, pistol-whip your girlfriend
Hit a lick for four grand, now they got some cash to fly

I made 'em empty out their pockets
Other kids dreaming of being astronauts
We were scheming to make a profit

You wanna play games? Better train for the triathlon
'Cause ain't no games round here, ho

Send him money, if he need me then I'm here for him
We done smoked so much weed, smoking weed ain't shit
Doing any hard drugs we could get our hands on

It wouldn't be GC without Mexicans
Claiming turf, gang signs spray painted on the picket fence

Chef,"Two tablespoons of cinnamon and two or three egg whites
A half a stick of butter melted
Stick it all in a bowl baby, stir it with a wooden spoon
Mix in a cup of flour, you'll be in heaven soon
Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooh, suck on my chocolate salted balls
Stick 'em in your mouth, and suck em
Suck on my chocolate salted balls
They're packed full of vitamins and good for you
So suck on my balls

Quarter cup of unsweetened chocolate and a half a cup of brandy
Then throw in a bag or two of sugar and just a pinch of vanilla
Grease up the cookie sheet cause I hate when my balls stick
Then preheat the oven to three fifty and give that spoon a lick

Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth
Suck on my chocolate salted balls (suck 'em now)
Put 'em in your mouth, and suck em
Suck on my chocolate salted balls
They're packed full of goodness, high in fiber
Suck on my balls

Hey, wait a minute, what's that smell
Smell like something burning
Well, that don't confront me now
Long as I get my rent paid on Friday
Baby you better get back in the kitchen
Cause I got a sneakin' suspicion
Oh man baby, baby, you just burned my balls!
Come, my balls on fire
Have mercy baby, my balls are burning
Give me some water, pour some water on me
My balls are burning, oh my goodness
I'm blowin' I'm blowin' them, do something

Ooh, suck on my chocolate salted balls (suck F 'em now)
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em, they're on fire baby

Now check it
Who get it live when the party dies down
Mysterious man showing up in your town
Lyrics like lightning, vocals like thunder
Neighborhood success or the overnight wonder
Uh, precise on mics but nice with the toe-to-toe
A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes
I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see y'all came
In the summertime banging at the b-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block
With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even
We set the bar high everybody start reaching, cause….

(chorus)
Who said I couldn't get it down like this
Some tried to get it but they got it like this
Put you in a mix, get your body the twist
Its the mystery man, that the fans cant resist

Six sold M-K-T playin the corner
Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona
See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys “hey hold up”
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up
Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil
Despite your size and them serious thighs
The long eyelashes and mysterious eyes
It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo…..

Chorus (x2)

Now if I wanted I could pump it in every club this week
But I pass cause it only adds to my mystique
If ya think that I'm weak then catch me out in the street
It aint nothing to show me homie man we got this heat
That nigga that got all y'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets
Mystery man, never take my mask off
But when it comes to the raps I can act y'all
Non-stop flow that might flood the dance hall
Peace I'm out, be easy I get at y'all

I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

Also ab auf die Zeil, Shopping vom feinsten
Läufer machen Rekordumsatz mit Weißem

Wurd zwar wach durch dieses Piepen aber easy peasen
Für heute gibt es wieder Frieden in den Kriegsgebieten
Alle verschieden, Krisen gehen Musik genießen
Seh alte Leute mit ihren Lieben auf Liegewiesen
Wie sie ziehen und dann liegend fliegen
Vitalisiert vom Vitamindrink, Energie ist fließend
Sogar die Zivis sind heut friedlich, laufen weiter, auch wenn sie es riechen
Heute kann meine Laune keiner von ihn' vermiesen
Fühlt sich gut an, der Familie Perspektiven bieten

Dies der offizielle Ri-mi-mi-mi-mix, Mix Mix
Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

Ich sag, woo
Sie nennen uns Mimimis
Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Leute fragen mich, woher ich komm'
Ich sage, ich komme aus Hamburg City
Sie sagen: „Ne, du weißt schon, was ich meine!“
Dabei war die Antwort richtig
Sie sagen, ich spreche ja toll deutsch
Fragen mich, wo hab' ich das so gut gelernt
Ich muss runterkomm', ich schwör', ich roll' 'n Joint
Und, und höre auf, den Menschen zuzuhören
Ich schwör', genauso wie es damals war
Ist es noch immer in der Gegenwart, eh
Ich kenn' das seit mei'm ersten Lebensjahr
Die Leute wollen's nicht einsehen, doch ich leb' hier schon mein Leben lang
Und wenn ich mecker' über dieses Land
Sagen sie: „Geh doch hin woher du kommst!“
Okay, dann geh' ich halt nach Eppendorf
Ich hab' auch angefangen mit Rappen dort
Aber das ist nicht, was du meintest, ne
Du willst, dass ich in meine Heimat geh'
Ich schwör', dies' Land hier ist so ignorant
Was? Wahrscheinlich bricht es bald 'n Weltrekord
Ich hab' hier niemandem 'n Job geklaut
Yeah, ich hab' hier vielen Leuten Jobs gegeben
Guck ma, dies hier geht raus an meine Mimimis
Sie mögen es nicht, wenn wir offen reden
Halb deutsch, halb Ausländer
Es heißt, ich führe ein Doppelleben
Und ich schaue hoch in Himmel, um zu Gott zu beten
Sag mal, kennt ihr auch ein paar Mimimis?

„Und jetzt der nächste Mimimi
Hier live und direkt
Illegal immigriert aus Ostafrika
Mein Mann Afrob“

Yeah, ey ey, Alter, was diese „Mimimi""?
Ich bin Intensivtäter, German Dream
Das ist Afrob made in Germany
Das Boot ist voll, Deutschland, Hysterie
Huh, sie nennen mich „Public Enemy“ (Enemy)
Im Fadenkreuz der AFD (AFD)
Sie sagen, ich wär primitiv (was?)
Lügenpresse ARD, ja, Leute, das ist Hassliebe
Ich hab keine Zeit, Mann, ich hab Krise
Ich mach Plus und ich mach Miese
Arbeite an Maschinen, bevor sie mich abschieben
Leute machen falschen Vergleich (Vergleich)
Es geht nicht um schwarz oder weiß (oh, nein)
Es geht um arm oder reich
Und wer das nicht begreift, ja, na dann tut's mir leid
Alter, was diese „Mimimi“?
Liegestuhl, Kampf am Strandbad von Rimini?
Kein Problem, da mach ich auch mit, ich bitte Sie
Gern billige Arbeitskraft für die Industrie
Ah, ich kenne alle deutschen Kaiser
Peter, Alexander und noch Hans Meiser
Sing das Lied der Deutschen, doch nicht alle drei Strophen
Eine ist erlaubt und die zwei sind verboten
Ich bin ein Immigrant, ein Gigant, Asylant
Braungebrannt, für dich bin ich sogar militant
„Oh mein Gott, die Kanaken nehmen überhand“
Jetzt ist sie weg, diese übergroße Toleranz
Die BRD wird überrant
Brauchen jetzt den nationalen Widerstand
Der Untergang des Abendlands, Lage ist sehr angespannt
So brisant, keine Angst, denn ich bin doch nur ein

Ah, eine Frage: bin ich wirklich deutsch
Oder gebe ich mich nur als Deutscher aus?
Umm, was soll ich sagen, Mann, ich fühl mich deutsch, yeah
Doch ich seh nicht wie ein Deutscher aus
Und jeder denkt, er wüsste, wer du bist
Terrorist, davon gehen die Deutschen aus
Okay, nicht alle, doch ich kenn mich mit Deutschen aus
Seit neustem grenzen mich die Deutschen aus
Geh und sag den Deutschen, Ausländer sind nur Menschen
Auf der Flucht, deshalb rennen wir über Grenzen
Ich hab dazu gelernt, ich kenn' die Konsequenzen
Doch ich putze keine Schuhe mehr, ich kämpfe, um zu glänzen
Sie reden ständig nur von Ängsten
Lenken, was du denkst auf allen Sendern und Frequenzen
Und auch wenn wir uns am Ende doch ergänzen
Denken sich die Menschen
Lass mal mit den fremden Kontinenten
Wo soll das enden? Shit, ich glaub, dass es aus ist (aus ist)
So mancher hier verfault, bis er braun ist (braun ist)
Auf der Vergangenheit 'ne faustdicke Staubschicht
Ein ganz schmaler Grad zwischen Klausnitz und Auschwitz
Und diese Ghettos haben wir selbst gemacht
Viele Kinder wachsen auf ohne Aussicht (ja)
Ja, ich weiß, wir leben beide in der selben Stadt
Doch ich spüre dein Vertrauen überhaupt nicht
Und geh ich raus, gibt's Probleme mit den Rechten
Und vor Gericht dann Probleme mit den Rechten
Wenn du das mit Menschen machst
Dann endet das im Fremdenhass
Und heutzutage nenn' wir das Probleme, die sich rächten
Halb Mensch, halb Mimimi, yeah
Kein Killer, wie man ihn im Krimi sieht
Wir sind clean, doch sehen aus wie auf Tilidin
Mein Lieblingslied ist bis heute „Billie Jean“, ja, ich bin ein

„Yo! Ok ok, wollt ihr noch mehr Mimimis
Hier heut' Abend sehen?
Ihr müsst noch 'n bisschen warten
Ich erzähl' euch kurz was“

Yeah, ich sag dies' der Re-mi-mi-mix
Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Remix, viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Die Menschlichkeit ist ein Minimum
Sie schalten unsre Stimmen stumm
Sie nannten uns als Kinder dumm
Wir waren wie DJ Khaled, sie wollen nicht, dass wir gewinnen
Und schauten uns mit Mitleid an, als wär' es 'ne Behinderung
Hoo, heute rulen Mimimis
Boateng hängt mit Jigga rum
Gäb es hier keine Mimimis, huh
Dann gäb es hier auch keine Entwicklung, Statement
Robert kam damals aus Afrika, ah
So wie auch viele andere Habescha
Heut ist er ein nationaler Star
Und gewinnt Awards in Kanada, Gratulation
Uh, ich bin stoned, Mann, wo waren wir grad?
Ohladidadida, so viele Nazis da, so krasse Party grad
Lass mich diesen Beat hier killen
Eko hat 'ne Serie und einen eigenen Kinofilm
Nicht schlecht für'n Quotentürken, lass den Flow hier wirken
Dies geht an alle Mimimis in allen Wohnbezirken
Trip kam aus Libanon, nahm ein Mikrofon
Heute hat er viel Erfolg, Mimimis kriegen Gold, woo
„Hey, mach mal'n Song gegen Nazis, Sam“
Warum? Ich versteh das nicht
Ich hab noch nie was gegen die gehabt (sag es)
Die hatten immer etwas gegen mich
Lasst uns Fremden doch die Hand geben, yo
Anstatt hier jeden Tag 'n Brand legen
Und ohne viel Kollateralschäden
Hier in Frieden in diesem Land leben, alle meine

Aber kann besser als viele deutsch (viele deutsch)
Jeder Türke klopft mir auf die Schulter (klopf klopf!)
Aber keiner, der sich Freezy käuft
Bisschen Fremdenhass liegt in der Luft
Gruß geht an die Pegida (Hoo Hoo)
Ich geh Samstagabend in den Puff (und?)
Und frage: „Ist die Peggi da?“
Manche machen einen auf korrekt
Dann nimm doch einen Flüchtling auf
Ich bin kein strenger Musilman
Aber esse Mama Müsli auf
Tja, das ist wie der Ek so ist
Ich date heut Beate Zschäpe
Sie sieht aus wie bei Exorzist (aber?)
Aber kennst ja, einmal blasen geht, ne?
Ja, ich bin ein Mimimi
Heul doch, Digga, Mimimi
Kanaken hören Jiggi-Beats
Verkaufen dir das Billigweed für ziemlich viel, hihihi

Am plakativsten wär' jetzt 'n bisschen Spätzle und Chai
Bilingual mit zwei, trilingual mit zehn
In zwei Ländern zu Hause und ich kann alles verstehen
Doch viele wollten mich verarschen während ich mit Farben klecker'
Sie kommen und sagen: „Nur eine Farbe wäre besser“
Ich war nie gut im Mal- und Kunstunterricht
Schwarzweiß kann ich nicht malen, wenn alles bunt ist für mich
Und wenn man sich den Kopf über die fremde Dummheit zerbricht
Stellt sich die Frage: Warum eigentlich?
Einerseits, andererseits, ich bin mitten drin
Isst du Schweinefleisch? Nur wenn sie beschnitten sind
Identität kann für mich nichts damit zu tun

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa (sí, sí)
Shakira, Shakira

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby, this is perfection?

Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa (sí, sí)

And I am starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby, así es perfecto?

If I know I am on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby, this is perfection?

Shakira, Shakira

Oh, boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

Senorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mi vida en Barranquilla se baila así sé
En Barranquilla se baila asi

Yeah, she's so sexy
Every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty
It's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

No fightin'

Ahora yo soy diferente
Pero tu sigues de me pendiente
Yo se que te va a doler 
Cuando me veas junto con el
Me canse de amarte
Me canse de darte la vida
y de las promesas que nunca cumpliste
Todo fue mentira
Me canse del juego y de tanto tiempo
Que perdía
Tanto trabajo me costo olvidarte
Porque te quería
Ahora pides que regrese
Pero mi cariño no mereces
Ahora se como vivir sin verte

ahora soy diferente
Ya logre sacarte de mi mente
Nada dura, nada es para siempre
Ya no hay dolor en mi corazón

ahora yo soy diferente
Pero tu sigues de mi pendiente
Yo se que te va a doler
Cuando me veas junto con el

tengo otro hombre, que no tiene miedo no
El tiene fuego que enciende mi corazón

Cheka,"Another new day takes up on you
A fanfare wakes the land
The naked lives just a shining down
At the dawn of the common man

Outside in the madding crowd
He laughs along the way
Traffic city, what a pity
It doesn't have a word to say

Troubled people, billions of people
They can't seem to understand
The ringing ears are unable to hear
The sounds of the natural plan

Yeah yeah yeah",Naci,2008
Chel'le,"Yo, it's taking a lot for me to give y'all all of me
For y'all to take it and run with it
And turn it into some shit that it's not

Yo, exceeded my expectations a while ago
They wondering why Dizzy the one that's always smiling for
I listen a lot and look at everything I done accomplished, mane
S'till, my baby girl and son is the main thing that I value most
Family, fuck a xanny, I'm puffing on this flower though
You piece of shit, no thang, we keep it lit
No hard feelings, don't ever change, don't ever quit
When I found out living legends s'till exist, I knew I had to commit
So I heard that this new generation was waiting on me
After The Golden Age, these old heads been praying for me
To get involved, maybe vent to y'all, and make an impact
Better plant a seed and water that bitch and watch it grow
Now how many times I gotta say it? I been down and out
But you only get so many chances 'till you're fouling out
And I'm like, let me live without taking no breaths
My mind is focused on which task I'm finna take on next, uh
I think back when I just hung with my dawgs
My mama could never keep a man 'cause we was running him off
Needed a father figure but I don't like how he coming across
He end up gone, she was sad but I felt like that's his loss
I told her, never bend your head, look the world straight in the eyes
You deserve love, but a queen don't need a king to survive
And it's a blessing to be able to rap and not feed y'all lies
Or fake my happiness like everything's just fine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
'cause the loudest on the Internet get to sleep through a quiet night
It's a big difference and it's teaching me a lot about who we are, how like
Money don't change people, it just bring out who they truly are
Man, I done seen the most from coast to coast
They got us crossing over the border line
I don't got all the answers but we need to be more organized
So here's a little enlightening for your peace of mind
Everything you need in this life you live will come at the perfect time
So God bless America

In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just like to trust (Trust)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America

Uh, follow me, follow me through the hardships
Pardon my need to be swift with how I start this speech
Who you more like? Malcolm or Martin?
The game that they play with us, brother, don't have no cartridge
Button mashers, disaster casters, they ass backwards
I might slave for a meal but you ain't my master
Running through the field, all I hear is laughter
'cause them chains that kept us here can no longer capture
The heart of my folk, foot on my the throat of my oppressor
For all of them ropes, they tied a tree for my ancestors
If limbs could talk, they'd cry for days
Sad, they gave all they had but couldn't break under pressure
Blood on the leaves, Glock on the dresser
Them laws plotting, protect and serve but I know better
The news a lie, to you and I, TV ain't real
So don't you try, to be like none of them Housewives
Selling us fools' gold
Tell a son to slang dope and daughter twerk when they get old
Damn shame, how we find time to sit around
Smoking and dranking, while they corporate banging
Don't be content with the hood, nigga, what is you thinking?
I got a small violin if you don't vote for complaining
About the government, stand up on some brother shit
And stop being on some other shit, God bless America

Despite all the barriers
If you do whatever you do every day
You can get it, I did it

From the poorest, they said I gotta push for all my dreams and they flourished
Then a forest full of obstacles, I got the dope 'cause I'm morest
Don't ignore it, that I built this vocab without a thesaurus
When the war is pressing, they be asking me questions like Katie Couric
Like, ""Did you sell dope when you fell broke?""
Tryna stop a male's hope who never dropped the jail soap
Made it up out of Hell's scope, they ask, can I spell vote?
I'm feeling like they tryna tell jokes, ya pale rope
I'm a U.S. citizen escaping the penitentiary they hid us in
The kid has been fitted to quit and then spit it and shit again
But I became noble and well-rounded like an oval
Never will I be grounded for disposal
Everybody be astounded by the mogul, Tech N9ne
No more saying, I can't afford this
Even when I was down, my plan was to never abort this
Don't forget, they said I sold my soul, that's horse shit
'cause I simply thought my way onto the Forbes list
So God bless America",God Bless America,2015
Chelle,"She said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
You about to grab your full clip so you can go retaliate
You wanna know why I'm trippin?
'Cause I don't wanna have to birth this baby on my own 
And have to explain why you passed away
You say, you good, like you may be home
But in my heart I know you may be wrong
I wish you understood I wouldn't agreed to a baby 
If you was gonna be beefing with other hoods, you trynna play me out
A negative is how you make me out but if something happened 
To you which one of your homies gonna help me raise this child?
We was in this together, be a man
And if they killed yo friend I know damn well they'll kill again
So don't you look at me stupid like everything's alright, 
It's not alright your stupidity can cost you your life
And now I'm stuck with your child, understand me
You worried about your goons and I'm worried about this family

Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

He said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
The fact that they used a full clip to kill my fucking best friend
So why you talkin about family? I considered him family, 
So don't mistake this for a muthafucking Def Jam
I'm trynna tell you I'm good, but if they take me home
I pray to God that you keep my baby strong
I may be wrong trynna handle with altercation
But how can I live my life if I ran from this situation?
So I take a little vacation after my nigga got blasted
I was riding when he was riding
Now I'm supposed to be scared of a casket you ain't feelin' that?
I ain't no killa but I'm killing back
I don't give a fuck!
I'mma retaliate like I can bring my nigga back
It's war, it's not my kindness it's insanity
Take a friend of mine and now everybody's an enemy
Fuck it I gotta do it, don't lose it I know you hate this shit
But I'll be damned if they get away with this. It's on

Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

Had ya pride not got in the way, I would have known just what I meant to you

Levanta la mano for peace, harmony and love

Lets come together people all around the world
En la union esta la fuerza escuchalo
So crank it up more, somos un solo Corazon


Hey! Lets do it right
Hands in the air, wave em side to side
Get up, stand up, we don't have to fight

Hey! Una nacion
El sentimiento se hare cancion
Mano a mano en un mismo amor
Hoy somos un solo Corazon

Libranos de todo mal
Why amparanos Señora
De este gran rumbon mundial

Why que tenemos en común un corazón,
Soy portavoz de la paz , mensajero de la nación

De la que usabamos cuando estabamos en la escuela 
Parecia un varilla why ahora se ve buena 
Se arreglo las gemelas ahora es que el gas pela 
Encomiendate al cielo why prende una vela

Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

Your face became all I know, I'd try to picture another
Why are we frayed at the edge, it's making me feel all to blame
I wanna know what's the deal

Is there a new girl silently screaming your name?

Chelsea Grin,"Who are you to decide what the meaning of perfection is 
And what makes you so high and mighty?
You're just like a weed slowly getting bigger but killing a beautiful rose
At the same time by taking all it's light and smothering it
I hope that feeling of being better then anyone else was worth it to you because
She's gone and can't ever come back
It's too late nothing can bring her back
It's worthless people like you that destroy something truly beautiful
You've caused innocence to die
Someone who didn't fit in with your bullshit ideals and finally came
To the point where she took her own fucking life
I hope you think about it every second of every day and you see her face when
You try to fall asleep at night
I hope it fucking haunts you

Be in charge of your own life not everyone else's
Just yours",Cast from Perfection,2010
Chelsea Grin,"This will be your bleak dissolution
I will rid the world of your filth
And I will scourge you with no remorse

I will abolish all the pain you've caused
By your pillage of the innocent
Your horrid fate will not be quick
Grisly horrors will fall upon you

I will make your insides
On the fucking outside
I'll tear through your skin
And watch you rot

So where's your pleasure now?
It's not so pleasing when you are the one
At the end of this misery

And watch you bleed

But I'll promise you

God can't show you where to hide",Cheyne Stokes,2010
Chelsea Grin,"How can you believe the lies bestowed upon you by a false creed when the truth is right in front of you?
They consume and hide the real truth to a superstitious fear and stitch the mouth of all who interfere
You look into the world with blind eyes, always fearful of your demise
But you people don't seem to realize is that you're fearing a fucking myth
A tale that you comply with or be condemned to torment
Your loving idol would conflict woe and pain?
I won't be deceived by serpent lies or cry out to the sky
This goes out to all of those who've ever feared to really live because of all the sin and blasphemy
Pursue what you really want and don't let anything stop you no matter what get what you want.
Nothing bad will ever come from getting what you desire
Forget the ruler no one will ever find out
Living your life this way will only bring great satisfaction so take it all and give nothing
Or are these the words of a snake?
Now it's gone and you will feel the pain of life
You were blinded by your greedy mind and now it's time
This is now your new reality hope you enjoy the choices of your mortality
You will then feel what its' like to bleed
You will feel the pain everday

Last night's horrors were far to much for you to fucking take
You cry out in terror, corpses all around but you can't remember a thing
Who caused this crime?
Just then you look down and see the blood stained on your hands and clothes
Panicking you begin to run this can't be it must be a dream
But you're not just going to let this happen 
So you turn your back you won't accept this
So you put the bodies in the walls and under the floor boards 
No one will ever know what went on this horrible night
Sitting in the corner you don't know what's real 
Are all these things just in your head?
No way to tell you try to forget it and get it out of your head 
You try to convince yourself nothing was true
It's just a dream nothing is real you awake and sit there in fear 
Never to speak of this again because it's all just in your head",False Sense of Sanity,2010
Chelsea Grin,"Why are we here?
A question that no one will ever answer so think for your fucking self
Don't believe something just because someone told you to 
And don't be scared into living someone else's way
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say 
Speak for yourself and never give that right away
I'm so sick of hearing people say how I should live my life 
And if I don't follow their rules I will suffer the consequence
I will live the way I want to and there's nothing you can say or do 
That will change me or the way I think
So save it for someone else
Never be afraid to open up your mind and look at the world through someone else's eyes
This is something you should never forget
If so then it's not really your life anymore
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say speak for yourself

There's nothing sacred here, Everything you once loved has been defiled
There's only pain, and sorrow
They bring the end
And there's nothing that can save you from this cruel fate
But it's your fault, it is you that brought them
They felt the presence of your blackened heart
And smelt the stench of your abject existence
They've come to cleanse your soul of it's affliction

Just wait until they have you in their grasp

Chelsea Grin,"Why are we here?
A question that no one will ever answer so think for your fucking self
Don't believe something just because someone told you to 
And don't be scared into living someone else's way
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say 
Speak for yourself and never give that right away
I'm so sick of hearing people say how I should live my life 
And if I don't follow their rules I will suffer the consequence
I will live the way I want to and there's nothing you can say or do 
That will change me or the way I think
So save it for someone else
Never be afraid to open up your mind and look at the world through someone else's eyes
This is something you should never forget
If so then it's not really your life anymore
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say speak for yourself 
And never give that right away

That you're unhappy here with me 
The hurt you've tried to hide can't help but show

It just might bring you back to me

I wanted everything to be just right

Well, it's half past five but there's no need to worry 
There's still lots of time after all he's always late 
When he's out with her he's never in a hurry 
So, I light a lonely candle and set his plate

Nobody but a fool would love you 
After the way you've done me 
Broke every vow you made me, broke every rule 
Who'd lie awake all night, cry til you were out of sight 
Loving you with all her might 
Nobody but a fool 

I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did 
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head 
All I know was your two lips kissed me heavenly 
Til yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me 

I put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
I go ahead and cry the make-up from my eyes
I let my mind play tricks and then
I let it fool me once again
Into thinkin' that I'll never be alright
Then when I'm no longer crazy and I'm back to my old self
I realize how good I've always felt

When he walked into the bar 
When he nodded from his table 
I said I know just how things are

Is when you've made your lady cry 
And you always say you'll only stay 
Till all her tears are dry 

Now for months I've watched you wrestle 
With that other side of you 
You're scared one day you'll lose your temper 
Yes and then you'll lose her too

And for years she's paid the price 
It might be too late you best not wait 
Till all her tears are dry

But I ain't lucky when it comes to love
I want it all but I never want to wait

And baby, I've been held and I've been tied down
I've been wrapped and I've been unwound
I've been kissed oh
But I ain't never been loved
Till I Was Loved By You

Now people told me that I was wrong
But I knew love was a sweeter song
I kept waiting for the perfect melody
Now in your arms it's plain as day
Knowing you was worth the wait
Come say you'll never give up on me

Chely Wright,"I called him for days, he didn't answer the phone 
I drove by his house, I knew he was home 
A week's worth of papers and mail in the box 
I thought he was dead, I picked the lock 
I found him in tears in the dark on his knees 
With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be 
And he said

Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse 
Call for the lady with the alligator purse 
She knows the spell to lift this curse 
Go find the lady with the alligator purse  

In an old stone house off 21st 
I found the lady with the alligator purse 
She answered the door, said I know who you are 
She lit a candle, consulted the stars 
When I saw her closing that reptile's hide 
I asked her point-blank, is my friend going to die 
And she said

I'm not a doctor, I'm not a nurse 
I'm just the lady with the alligator purse 
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst 
So said the lady with the alligator purse 

She said, look at what happened to Cleopatra 
When she didn't take my advice 
And Romeo, Juliet, they didn't get it 
Too bad, those kids were so nice 

By the time we got back to my pitiful pal 
There was no sign of life till he saw the alligator 
Purse on her arm, the gleam in her eyes 
She opened the bag, there was nothing inside 
She said, there's no secret, it's love that I use 
I just carry this bag because it matches my shoes 
And she said

Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse 
Don't call the lady with the alligator purse

Take it from the lady with the alligator purse

We couldn't have just lost it
I know it's round here somewhere

Maybe we packed it up
With college books and winter clothes
Things we thought were in the way
Out of style or just outgrown

We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone

Praying I'd stumble across

Shinning in those faces
It used to be here somewhere
I know it's still here somewhere
Reflected in our children's eyes
How could we misplace it
I know it was here yesterday
How could it just slip away
it was more then just a box of junk
We stored away to gather dust
This was a dream we thought
We always could reach out and touch

To look at you and all you are
And I think I can unlock the mystery
Break through your walls and win your heart

There's no need to be afraid
We can take our time
But I'll take my chance and say

Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in

I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall 
If it's really love there's no risk at all
I can love you if you'll only let me in

I see your strength and how you shine
You're a diamond in the rough that should be mine
But you're still fighting an old old war
That's left you wounded and left you scarred
You hide your weakness
Behind those walls
You think it's your own secret
But in your eyes I see it all

Let me love you, really love you
Open up your heart and let me in 
I don't know who taught you not to trust

He's mastered the art of looking sincere

And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man

Blink back the tears show me you've still got your pride
Just get yourself lost in a sad country song

And you could tell by the fingerboard her painted nails were long
She only needed three cords to play those good ole country songs
And her name's etched in the finish like a fading battle scar

With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar

You tried to tiptoe in
I sat here for hours

Lyin' there with you
Was well worth everything that you and I went through 

And so it goes, our life's been that way
Puttin' out fires, takin' it day by day
And look at this year, it's been our hardest one yet
Just when we thought it had gotten bad as it could get
You got transferred to Denver, I stayed behind
Put the house on the market 'bout went outta my mind
And your dad got sick, I've never seen you so scared
We almost didn't make it through the year 

But that weekend in the mountains
In a cabin all by ourselves
Makin' that one memory made up for everything else 

Oooh me and my insecurities
You and your stubborn pride
If we've learned anything it's there's no winner when we fight 

So this mornin' in our kitchen
After talkin' all night long
We finally stopped tryin' to figure out
Who's right and who is wrong
And when you hold me like you're holdin' me
And I kiss your tired face
We know we took the long way here
But wound up in a better place

Or one weekend in the mountains
Any moment we're together makes up for everything else",One Night in Las Vegas,2001

We've got a million
To stop taking chances

What if we fly
And dive off the edge of the end of the world as we know it

What if the arms of the wind carry us to the place
We never could find
Yes we might fall

I was a little early, i had a little time
I sat up at the bar talking to a stranger
It seemed a safe thing to do
While i was waiting, while i was waiting for you

He said that i was pretty, then he turned back to his beer
And something about this stranger was subtle and sincere
He said he grew up in Memphis but he didn't like the blues
And our one dance turned into two
While i was waiting, while i waiting for you

When you walked in the door
When you walked up to him
When you took my hand and said that you were cutting in
This stranger from Memphis was very polite
He said you sure do have a lovely wife

Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends
That I have always kept

But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces from my past
That I shouldn't have to share

A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it
That didn't quite rhyme
But it made me cry

In a Dear Jane letter
From a different guy
He broke up with me
And he told me I'm not always right

And a stolen key
From an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer

I don't keep these things
'Cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I wanna stay
Right where I'm at

I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't wanna mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff

A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in
Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '98

We danced all night, stayed out so late
We thought we were stars
Closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap

But still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer

I'm not trying to hide these things
From the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him
Thanks to my yesterday

So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue
Fight the urge to say
'It's my way or no way at all'

And now I cherish love a whole lot more

The same old faces, the same old places, ain't nothin' ever new
After the football game we'd hang around the high school parkin' lot
Then we'd pile into a couple of cars and head off to our favorite spot
Down to the river
We went to the river

My sophomore year was a carbon copy of the ones that came before
Until that night in late November that shook us all down to the core
We'd won the game by twenty points, couldn't wait to celebrate
But our lead car was goin' way to fast and they didn't even hit the brakes
They went into the river 
Deep in the river

We buried Laurie Maybrie in the clothes that she'd been wearin'
Her cheerleader outfit never looked so outta place
That sweater and that pleated skirt of blue and white and crimson
Just didn't belong in that shiny silver case

I moved here to Nashville on May 12 of '89
And I started gettin' letters once a week from this friend a mine
I'd gone to school with Christine Thorough from kindergarten on
She'd say, ""Hang in there 'cause I just know you're gonna be a star""

She and her boyfriend and a couple a kids I guess she met through him
Set out for the merazine to try to cool off by takin' a swim
There'd been a lotta rain that summer and the current was too strong
I heard that they did all they could but Christine, she was gone
Into the river
She died there in the river

I was baptized in that same water, gave my soul to Jesus
How can such a peaceful place be filled with so much pain?
Cause two young mothers lost their daughters right there for no reason

But I've never seen you crying

With this love I thought we treasured
If we keep on like this
We just might miss forever

I can see the hurt from the words
That I'm throwing as they hit you
Why can't I just shut my mouth
And take some time to breathe
You'd think I'd know by now
To think before I speak

And those nights I don't
It keeps me company
I've got it on in the mornings having coffee
And after work when I'm watching TV
It's my comfort it's my torture and yes I realize
It's just some worn out old fabric
But it's my consolation prize
And I'd be a wreck in a New York minute

Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single seein' double
Wound up in a whole lot of trouble
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night

When I came home from work this mornin'
My baby was feelin' low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didn't want to go where he told me to
'Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now there's somethin' fishy 'bout this whole deal
I don't see where I made my mistake

When I woke up this mornin'
Like me the sun was high
Well I started walkin' the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldn't think of a doggone thing
That hadn't already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
For I'm already dead

But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night",Feelin' Single and Seein' Double,2007

Teach them well and let them lead the way.

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.

And it seemed like they just couldn't be
Around each other enough

Something happened to the love story

The world don't stop inside
Gotta make it strong every day

The only thing they's worth the wait
Is keepin' it real when you're all fed up
Boy you know I want to say
Don't nobody want to plain
Even though sometime it come your way
But the truth is if you give respect
I'll make sure that you gonna get it back
And if it hurt like hell inside
And you need a place to hide

So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

Bastará para ganarme

Chenoa,"Presiento que hoy será cuando me verás
Cada vez que intento estar cerca de ti te vas
Que tonta me siento cuando todo sale mal
Y no sé como explicar lo que tu me das

Me he comprado ropa nueva para destacar
Tu como si no estuviera pasas sin saludar
Te he dicho como me llamo pero no hay señal
Y no dejo de pensar qué es lo que hago mal

Tantas veces he soñado y otras tantas he llorado
Lágrimas pensando en ti
Y mientiéndome a mi misma
He creído que tenía algo más

Y no sé como acercarme a ti
A todo lo que me haces sentir si te veo
Y no sé como sacar de mi
Eso que tu me haces sentir si te veo
Cómo amar a alguien que no ve

Creo que hoy me has mirado casi sin querer
Me he quedado sin aliento y eso no puede ser
Hoy me invitas a tu lado por primera vez
En tus ojos puedo ver que esto puedo ser

Tantas veces he soñado y otras tantas he llorado
Lágrimas pensando en ti
Y ahora creo que no miento
Pienso que llegó el momento para mi

Y ya sé como llegar a ti
Como enseñar mi corazón mis deseos
Y ya sé lo que sientes por mi
Y no me cansaré de oír que me quieres
Ahora amar es algo de los dos

Y sintiendo en cada abrazo
El amor tan esperado que soñé tiempo atrás
Pero ocurren los milagros
Y te siento aquí a mi lado de verdad

Y ya sé lo que sientes por mi
Y no me cansaré de oír
Que me quieres
Ahora amar es algo de los dos

Ayudame amor
Ayudame a sacarte de mí
Ayudame porfavor

Aguantar la situación, tanto dolor
Disimular y sonreir sin querer

Es la tristeza que me hace sonreír cada mañana
Es lo que llega desde el barrio al alma adentro
Lo que se filtra por el mismo corazón

Lo que en las venas se hacen locos sentimientos
Lo que me hace palpitante de emoción
Para mí todo eso es guaguancó
Para mí todo eso es guaguancó

Es más que la mulata que menea
La cintura como una revolución
Va más allá del toque de un tambo
Y hasta el amor me parece un guaguancó

Para mí el guaguancó es una alborada
Porque en el alma se prendió como una luz
Es una fuerza penetrante de verdad
Es la cadencia que me da felicidad
Es la cadencia que me da felicidad

Te están llamando pa' que goces como yo

Son las cinco de la mañana y ya amanece
Juan Pachanga bien vestido aparece
Todos en el barrio están descansando
Y Juan Pachanga en silencio va pensando

Que aunque su vida
De fiesta y ron, noche y rumba
Su plan es falso igual
Que aquel amor que lo engaño

Y la luz del sol se ve alumbrando
Y Juan Pachanga el manito va penando
Vestido a la última moda y perfumado

Con zapato en colores
Ye, ye bien lustrados
Los que encuentren
En su camino los saludan
Hey man que feliz
Es Juan Pachanga todos juran

Pero llevar el alma el dolor de una traición
Que solo calman los tragos
Los tabacos y el tambor
Y mientras la gente duerme aparece
Juan Pachanga con su pena y ámense

Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
Amanece con la pena
Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
No, no, no, no, no, no, te quiere la morena

Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
Mira que esta amaneciendo
Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
El amor, amor, amor está muriendo

Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
Olvídala, olvídala, olvídala, olvídala

Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
Porque nunca te ha querido

Dale también olvido

Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon

Rode with us to Memphis

And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black

To someone else who is very close to you

Never come back and forget you ever saw my face

I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume,
And how I smelled it was in my own room!
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand

Oh the camel back is broken
By the one extra straw added on

When her last ray of sunshine is gone

And I turn the gun around

Runnin' right on time
But it's off the track
And I'm losing my mind
And you hold me the last time

Cher,"I had a taste of bitter life
 At sweet sixteen
 I was growing up too fast
 If you know what I mean
 Met an older man
 Who taught me his own way to live
 And all I had to do to keep him
 Was to give and give

 [Chorus:]
 The carousel man
 Kept me going around and round
 Carousel man always know
 That I'd stay around
 The carousel man
 Wouldn't let me off his merry-go-round

 I followed him around in traveling shows
 Along the main county lines
 Watching him drinking his mind away
 Not ever knowing my name at time
 Each night when the show closed down
 He used to tell me of his dreams
 He was wearing new French suits
 While I mended my torn jeans

 [Chorus:]

 Then one night in Santa Fe
 The horses stop going around
 There he was my poor rich man
 Lying on the Mexico ground
 All the sad music of his life
 Is still spinning in my mind
 The carousel starts up again
 And I found my place in life

I haven't seen you in a long, long time
I haven't fooled around with any candles lately
Just thought you might have some music in mind

Maybe we could even live a verse or two
And I could finish this old love song
So I could start singing it to you, oh
I could start singing it to you
If I could finish this old love song
Then I could start singing it to you

Won't you come and boogie-woogie with me, baby
It's been a while since I held you close to me
I haven't met many boys like you, baby
Knew I would find you eventually

Oh, I just want to serenade you
Maybe we could even live a verse or two
And I could finish this old love song
So I could start singing it to you, oh baby
I could start singing it to you, oh honey
If I could finish this old love song

Cher,"Now the greenest green I've ever seen
Was the grass on which you laid
And the bluest blue was in my eyes
When you said you couldn't stay
And the biggest lost I ever took
Was losing what we've begun
And the greatest song I ever heard
Was the one we never sung

Now the reddest red I've always said
Is the sunset coming down
Soon the blackest night that kills the light
Is the only thing around
And the downest down I ever been
Is when I knew my race was run
And the greatest song I ever heard
Was the one we never sung

Time will kill the pain they say
And we'll live to love another day
If you want to win you got to play the game
Now the greatest break came on the day
We were standing in the rain
And the hardest hurt I've ever know
Was when you tried to ease my pain
And the longest day in history
Waiting till my crying's done
And the saddest song I ever heard
Was the one we finally sung",The Greatest Song I Ever Heard,1974
Cher,"I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do?
I could never see tomorrow

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories do days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can a loser ever win?

Baked a tray of muffins
Hung some wet-wash out to dry

I could look them in the eye
You've gone away, you've gone away
How will I get though the day?
This God-forsaken day
Drank some bitter coffee
Read your note ten times or more
When I'd washed the dishes twice
I got down and scrubbed the floor
Empty chair at supper
Everybody's actin' strange
Food just gettin' cold
Kids real quiet for a change
You've gone away, you've gone away
How will I get through the day?

As I walked slowly up the stairs
Pushed my tears back down
As I stood listenin'
To their prayers

So we wake up in the morning
And we go our separate ways
Present in our silence
As the music softly plays
Each day like the day before
We tell ourselves
We'll try once more
To once again we lay here
Barely touching in our bed
We're just two people
Clinging to a thread

And so we just pretend a bit
And we never say the words
That spell the end of it

To fan the dying spark

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

I won't make it any other way

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Thought I'd see you one more time again

Living inside our castle of loneliness
Unable to make amends
Such perfect strangers are we

Cher,"You're looking at him from across the room
Wondering just how it all slipped away so soon
You're looking to find some look in his eyes
That will take you back to yesterday

Don't remember the when or the where or why
All you know is that something has changed inside
And you can't bring it back, no matter how you try
You know it's over, you've got to say goodbye

Such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers

You can't seem to find the right words to say
And it's too late for talking now, anyway
There's no one to blame, it's just not the same
And it's never gonna be the same again, no

So you're trying to figure out what went wrong
Where does the feeling go when the feeling's gone?
And you pray for the strength just to carry on
You've got to let go of someone you've loved so long

It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers

So kiss him goodbye, try to walk away
With your head held high
Think about the good times, don't cry, don't cry
Though it's tearing you apart inside

It's such a shame, such a shame
And you can't bring it back, no matter how you try
You got to let go, you've gotta say goodbye

Such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers

Such a shame when you don't have each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Lovers become strangers

Cher,"I remember every word you said
We can't go on this way
Last night, you had me going out of my head
Should I go or stay?
But I've given you everything
That one woman could give a man
So when you gonna recognize and realize
Just what we had, now tell me
Who you gonna believe, her or me?
What's it gonna be, Who you gonna believe?
Before your heart shatters, love is all that matters
You put me through
That lover's game over and over
Someday someone's gonna
Put you through the same
Lover to lover
I hope you don't find out too late
I hope you never have to feel the pain
'Cause if you lose
The love you took for granted
That you could never appreciate
Who you gonna believe, her or me?
Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe?
Before you make up your mind
You better take some time
What about me, don't you think
I need a man here standing by my side
And what about you, you need a woman
To hold you through those cold and lonely nights
Oh, what about us we belong together
Forever and ever, oh I'll be there
If you should ever need me
Oh, I know everything will work
Out fine, just believe it
Oh, I know cause we've been through
This a million times, keep on believing
Well I hope you don't find out too late
Hope you never have to feel the pain
'Cause if you lose the love you took for granted
That you could never appreciate, after all this time
Who you gonna believe, her or me?
Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe?
Who are you fooling, well you're not fooling me, no
Who you gonna believe, you can risk it all

You can believe in me, believe in me",Who You Gonna Believe?,1991

Please don't close your ears
To what I'm saying
Before I ride away into the early day
I spent the lonesome evening hours praying
That you will change your mind
And try me one more time

Come to your window

Into pieces on the ground

And I want to go to the bathroom
What do we do now
What do we make of this

Can my blood flow

Lets throw our hearts in the mire

Lets sell our eggs to any buyer

She threw caution to the wind
As she followed him around
While he slowly dragged her down
So overpowering was the love
That he had made
It captured all the young girl's hearts
And soul and mine
In another words love drove her blind

Too much emotion for a girl
She let her heart become her world
A world that God has never wrought
That brought us under we are taught
Had she'd been wise and she had known
She could of fed him love alone
She should've know the day would come
When he would quit her for fun
He needed fresh young meat to carve
And left her heart and mind to starve

Cher,"CHORUS:
Boys go and shine up your shoes
Girls run and powder your nose
?Cause tonight you'll be shakin?
From your head down to your toes
Well feeling you're cool is as good as lookin? it
Thinkin? your?re cool is as good as knowin? it
Playin? it cool is as good as blowin? it
You know you can't spend a dollar
If you ain't got a dime
You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time
So go read up your books and sharpen your hooks
Then all you need is money and a mouth full of honey
And if you play your cards right after dancin? all night
You won't have to walk home alone
You won't have to walk home alone
Boys you can hang loose and slip up real cool
But if that lady has a love noose
She might never let you go
And if you think that maybe you're too young
And you just can not cope
The grab a razor sharp pair of cutting shears
And cut a hole right in the rope
Snip a hole right in the rope

You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning
You can't remember what you did
Just ring up some of your friends
And they'll tell you just how low you slid
Oh don't be ashamed of anything you hear
After all you can't be blame
When you're drinking so much beer
Hey don't you worry
That what you did just wasn't right
Just remember brothers and sisters
After every day?s another night
Just remember brothers and sisters
After every day?s another night

Gonna make you wonder
Gonna make you mad
Same ol' heartache your best friend
Has come to visit once again
Your mistake was in the beginning
When you thought that he would last
When you weren't looking
No you weren't listen
And once he left you broke like glass

Let this be a lesson to you
Take this message to your heart
Love is gonna slip right through you
You got to watch it from the start

Thought you had yourself a true love
Thought he was in love with you
But he was just like a devil
Took your heart and broke it to
Well there's no telling who's on the level
And there's no way to know what's real
Just remember how it all happened
And be sure that you know who's got the deal

Let this be a lesson to you
Take this message to your heart
Love is gonna slip right through you
You got to watch it from the start

WRITERS ERIC CLAPTON, STEPHEN BISHOP

Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two.
I've seen the stars fall from the sky.
Holy mother, can't keep from crying.
Oh I need your help this time,
Get me through this lonely night.
Tell me please which way to turn
To find myself again.
Holy mother, hear my prayer,
Somehow I know you're still there.
Send me please some peace of mind;
Take away this pain.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you.
Holy mother, hear my cry,
I've cursed your name a thousand times.
I've felt the anger running through my soul;
All I need is a hand to hold.
Oh I feel the end has come,
No longer my legs will run.
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight.
When my hands no longer play,
My voice is still, I fade away.
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms.

So scared I never been
Too hard to keep it in
Good girl, independent citizen
But you can't go back
No they never let you back

And they're ready to attack
And you can't go back
And you're terrified
You're gonna fall

Making all that noise

On a dry martini on a rack
They're slipping out

With every man you meet
You might as well be wise
And take it from the boys

Take it from the boys
Take it from the boys
You might as well be wise
And take it from the boys

Take it from the boys
Take it from the boys
You might as well be wise

Do this and promise that
Well that's how they're all about
Watch out, you're dealing with a photostat
When they say they care it's a bonify affair
Look out, beware of the businessman
Express American, he'll be gone so fast
Cause he travels first class
With his now and powie stash
And his heart unofficial glass

On the back seat were scratches
From the marks of men

And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music

Till the clock struck on the twelve

Than I knew myself

She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words
That were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card
Still stayed black
She said the man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back and forget
You ever saw my face

I couldn't sleep

And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I sneaked back
And caught her with my man
Laughing and kissing
Till they saw the gun in my hand

I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Silently for me.",Homeward Bound,1999
Cher,"Guilty undertaker sighs
Lonesome organ grinder cries
Silver saxophone says
That I should wait for you
The crack bells and the washed out horns
Blowing into my face with scorn
That's not the way
I wasn't born to lose you

I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey I want you

Drunken politicians leap upon the street
While mothers weep
And saviors were fast asleep
They wait for you
I wait for them to read your looks
While drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to open up the gate for you

I turn to the queen of spades
And talk to my chambermaid
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there's nothing that she doesn't see
She knows where I like to be
But it doesn't matter

Now you're dancing child
With his Chinese suit
He spoke to me and I took his flute
I know I wasn't very cute to him was I
But I did it because you like
Because you took him for a ride
Because the time was on his side
And because

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk

Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see

You got a lotta nerve to come on to me

You got the kind of lips that do more than drink

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint

To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness

You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe

While she lay crying, I felt helpless
Where are these cracks that she fell through

Than Bob Dole's useless arm
There are no fires burning brightly
What's even worse, there's no alarm

Cher,"So leave if you're leaving
Go if you must go
You won't see me down on my knees
Begging you to come back home

'Cause I refuse to give you the right
To cause these eyes to cry at night
I'm well prepared to live my life
Without you

When you walk away
You won't walk away with my heart
There will be no tears in the dark
No crying, no dying
No waiting for you to come back

When you're out the door
That don't mean I won't breathe no more
And I will not beg you to stay
When you walk, when you walk
When you walk away, when you walk away

This heart won't stop beating
'Cause you said goodbye
And you won't see me fall all in pieces
Or break all apart inside

And I will lose not one night of sleep
Crying for what couldn't be
I'm well prepared to never think
About you

When you walk away
You won't walk away with my heart
There will be no tears in the dark
No crying, no dying
No praying for you to come back

When you're out the door
That don't mean I won't mean I won't breathe no more
And I will not beg you to stay
When you walk, when you walk
When you walk away

'Cause I refuse to give you the right
To cause these eyes to cry at night
I'm well prepared to live my life without you
Without you

When you walk away
You won't walk away with my heart
There will be no tears in the dark
No crying, no dying, no begging

When you're out the door
That don't mean I won't breathe no more
And I will not beg you to stay
When you walk, when you walk

When you walk away
You won't walk away with my heart
There will be no tears in the dark
No crying, no dying
No begging for you to come back

When you walk away
When you walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
Please walk away
Just walk away
No crying, no dying
Just walk away

There's only one way up so your heart's got to go there
Through the darkest night
See the light shine bright
When heroes fall in love or war they live forever

Can you hear me tonight
For the broken hearted, battle scared, I'll be by your side
This is a song for the lonely when your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer
'Coz someone's there for you

Well love don't need a reason
She can pick you up or leave you bleeding
I've seen a strong man cry
I know the reason why
We all forgive we all forget
We just keep believing

Cher,"All alone
I must stand
Even when I'm running
And it feels, like a dream
I need to awaken from

I believe
When it hurts
We must keep on trying
But I want, and I need
Like a river needs the rain
There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
I just want to breathe again
Like a summer's day I need to feel the heat again

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I want to be alive again

Here's the night, where are the stars 'cause I need some guiding
And it cuts like a knife as I watch you walk away

There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
I just want to live again
Like a stormy rain I need to hear it beat again

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I want to be alive again
I want to be alive again

'Cause I did my best
Baby who'd have guessed that I failed the test
'Cause when love ain't blessed and it's laid to rest it can leave a mess

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame",Alive Again,2002

Together easily
Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me
And everything in between
