Trummy Young,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon,1998
Trummy Young,"I want a little girl, call my own.
She must be someone who's all alone now.
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah.

I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book.
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T.

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care.
She don't wear nylon hose, oh.

I want a little girl to love a lot.
You know that I'd give her everything I got.
I want a little girl to fall in love with me.",I Want a Little Girl,1999
Trummy Young,"Tea For Two
Tony Bennett
(Irving Caesar/Vincent Youmans) 

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake

Trummy Young,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1999
Trummy Young,"Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.

Weary, totin' such a load,
Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Weary totin', it's such a load,
Whike I'm travelin' down, travelin' down that lonesome old road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.",The Lonesome Road,2001
Trummy Young,"You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Thin or fat, young or old;
Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

Trummy Young,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

Trummy Young,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

To the Mississippi?
We'll take a trip to the land of dreams
Blowing down the river, down to New Orleans

The band is there to meet us
Old friends to greet us
That's where the line and the dark folks meet
A heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

I said, Basin Street, Basin Street
Where the elite always meet
Down in New Orleans, the land of dreams

Trummy Young,"Who's the loving daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, ""Baby, won't you swing it with me""
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood""

First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said ""Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me""
""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood""

In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skipping
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""

In the mood for all his kissing
In the mood his crazy loving
In the mood what I was missing
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""

So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""

Trummy Young,"Me and my wife live all alone 
In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep. 

The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop, 
We'd better take another drop.",Little Brown Jug,2014

With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

With memories
That never die

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

Send back my love

Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Well I begin the weekend with a groove roll about eight deep now
What's my next move
Wait until night fall so I could enjoy systems
Pump by four Jeeps
running like a convoy roll to the club
Kind of crowded
What a scene
pulling up with Jodeci
Blasting out the fifteen
So I park my ride 
Girls see my gear and notice my grill
Here comes the pointing and staring
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Now I sign a couple of autographs
Take a few flicks
Order Dom Perignon and lay back with my chicks
Mike is on the left of me
Smooth is Flipping
Tricky and Moet are on the dance floor ripping
Silk is with a cutie
Big D, I'm trying to find him
Tim is in the front and
Mo'Bettas right behind
and me I'm just laying on the prowl
Guys say what's up as the girls cry aaaahhh
She grabbed her man
I think she tried to play'em
My only thought was to step to the a.m.
'Cause I came to have a good time
and at the end of the night
No doubt I'm gonna get mine
'Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain if you know what I mean
understand I'm not conceded
Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth dark romeo freak kind of fellow
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Do that dance do that dance, baby.
Do that dance. Let's work it out.
Do that dance do that dance baby.
 
Do that dance do that dance, baby.
Do that dance. Let's work it out.
Do that dance do that dance baby.
 
Lounging on the d.l.
this type of night is rare
I glance to the right
Oh, who do we have here
Puff and stew gettin' ripped
What the hell
I see Mr. Uptown himself, Andre Harrell
conversating 
with his boys
as they start to barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mello, so I leap to sista' and the soul
rollin' five deep
Mark, Corey, Shakim, L.Q. doin' the wild thing
'cause the soul is true
And every time I hear the music thump-id-dee-thump
and all the girlz gettin' bucked right in your rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.

Look a little higher, kinda pray to the Lord
Because I always believe that the Lord can help ya if nobody else could
But sometimes I think he don't even hear me
So after falling alone on my knees, look a little higher
Kinda raise my voice a little higher
And this is what I say when I call on my man

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out before you knew what a plan was

Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.
You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door
like ""Eric B. for Pres,"" respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking for so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know is he really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited
in the game word to the hyphen in my name!

I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me

Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before)
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher

[Chorus]

I'm ""Rated R,"" my brain contains graphics things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher

There was a knock at the door now check it I'm bout tuh hip ya
Door opens wide about 10 or 11 strppers

Okay, let's do this (the watcher)

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out before you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fucking with whom?
Allowed me to be taught
You cowards is just now learning the shit that we talk
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.
You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door
like ""Eric B. for Pres,"" respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking for so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know is he really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited
in the game word to the hyphen in my name!

The past present nigga the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops
It's the Roc

[Chorus]
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before)
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher

[Chorus]

I'm ""Rated R,"" my brain contains graphics things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher [echoes]

What He did for me 
Remember, I will remember 
How He died for me 

early Sunday morning came 
The stone had been rolled away 
They stepped inside the empty grave 
Alone in dismay 
They were thinking he was gone 
They were not believing 
Death of the lamb did bring 
Forgiveness and healing 
Why do you seek Him here among the dead? 
He is risen! 

remember, I will remember 
What He did for me 
Remember, I will remember 
How He died for me 

I know it's You who lives inside of me 
I know it's true the peace of mind you bring to me

Fassent griefs de leur peine à ceux qu'ils ont élus

Trystan Layne,"Oh, you tell me that you love me
Yes, you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow's never there

[Chorus:]
Oh, tomorrow never comes
No, tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never comes

Many weeks now have I waited
Many long nights have I cried
Just to see that happy morning
When I'd have you by my side

[Chorus:]

So tomorrow I'll be leaving
Yes, tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow you'll be weeping
But tomorrow never comes

[Chorus:]",Tomorrow Never Comes,2008
TS1,"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road",Not Afraid,2014
TS7,"Do you want a piece of my time
Or a piece
Of my mind
Bare another chip on my shoulder
My blanket so you don't get cold
Oh Oh
Do you want to cover your eyes
Do you want to see through mine
Taking my darkest years
So you don't disappear

[Chorus:]

I'll give you
All of me
Then I can walk away
Free from the weight of the world that believes
So come on, come on

Do you really want my arms
So you can hold- my hand
Take the skin off of my back
Take the feet from under me
So you can- stand
Take in all the people I like
Break in all my sunny skies
And I will take all of your rain
For the ones you hate

I'll give you

no knowledge that you've been led astray. 
They're holding you down with claws of love. 
Keep you from saying what you're thinking of. 

What have you done? 
Your life isn't for you anymore. 
Where have you gone? 
Your old self is easy to ignore. 

You surrendered. 
Just follow the path they've laid out. 
You pretend to be happy. 
I want you back so I'll point out: 

This is not about our future, 
It's about what we do now. 
Nothing is more real than life, 
And you have the right to be yourself in the crowd. 

I will miss you. 
I'm not good enough for you. 
No spring in your step. 
Your shining fire has been put out. 

Sealed yourself in. 
Nothing can affect your thick skin. 
I can't get through to you, 
And now you'll never learn anything new. 

You look around, creativity dead. 
You're missing out on the blued and red. 
You're fucking blind! 
Your brain has been immersed in whitewash.",Epic,2004

Tub Ring,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49 
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line 
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadillacs 
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by 
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry 
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black. 
One day I devised myself a plan 
That should be the envy of most any man 
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand 
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired 
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired 
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand. 
[CHORUS] 
I'd get it one piece at a time 
And it wouldn't cost me a dime 
You'll know it's me when I come through your town 
I'm gonna ride around in style 
I'm gonna drive everybody wild 
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round. 
So the very next day when I punched in 
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends 
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears 
Now, I never considered myself a thief 
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece 
Especially if I strung it out over several years. 
The first day I got me a fuel pump 
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk 
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome 
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox 
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks 
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home. 
Now, up to now my plan went all right 
'Til we tried to put it all together one night 
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. 
The transmission was a '53 
And the motor turned out to be a '73 
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone. 
So we drilled it out so that it would fit 
And with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit 
We had that engine runnin' just like a song 
Now the headlight' was another sight 
We had two on the left and one on the right 
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on. 
The back end looked kinda funny too 
But we put it together and when we got through 
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin 
About that time my robot walked out 
And I could see in it's eyes that it had it's doubts 
But it opened the door and said ""Destroy all humans."" 
So we drove up town just to get the tags 
And I headed her right on down main drag 
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around 
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh 
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff 
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds. 
[CHORUS] 
I got it one piece at a time 
And it didn't cost me a dime 
You'll know it's me when I come through your town 
I'm gonna ride around in style 
I'm gonna drive everybody wild 
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

To write down, so in the morning I wouldn't forget.
Next day I looked over what was written and oddly it was only ones and
Zeroes,
But perfect in the fact that it completed my set.
Product of life I've been told, theories are stagnant and old
Time to demystify something new
Necessity leads us to change, what we discover is strange
Solely depending on point of view
Tonight, tonight I turn out my light and dream of carbon and protein
Which increase my might
(tonight, tonight I turn out my light and dream of hygiene and posture
Which make me seem right)
Research avoids some regret, predicting what we will get
Error accept and therefore gone.
Physics just hinder the dream, bite the wax tadpole it seems
Progress continues and marches on
Tonight, tonight I turn out my light and dream of vitamins and haircuts
And genetic delight
Last week I was working in my kitchen when oddly I discovered cold
Fusion,
So I wrote down the process on the back of my hand.
Next time when the recipe repeated I still thought that something else
Was needed
Cause texture and flavor were still quite bland.
I dreamt I was swimming in the ocean and came face to face with a blue
Whale.
It frightened me the size that it would grow.
I found my purpose, I must prevent this, before he hurts us.
Bite the wax tadpole.

",No More Refills,2001
Tub Ring,"I had the dream again the one where I just started to ascend
And my vision grew much clearer
Then all the people and the buildings and the ground began to blend
And I saw a set of numbers
I had the dream again the one where I was forced to take a train
From Chicago to Atlanta
And when we reached top speed I had to give the current ETA
So I grabbed a calculator
Ooh I'm a number, you're a number. can't you see?
And my cells are all dividing
Ooh I'm a number, you're a number. can't you see?
And my race is multiplying
I walked into a store and bumped into a pyramid of cans
And they fell into a pattern
And when the clerk came out he pointed at the triangle he planned
And I had to know the tangent
I still think we have at least a million years to go until we reach the end
Soon we'll overthrow the sky and use it for ourselves and all we comprehend
3.1415926 a work of fiction
Ever think the circle is a trick?
Grab a pen ill add it to the list. of comprehension
3.1415926
I still think the odds are good that you can make a bet on what will be the
Odds
When the numbers shape our world, and we control the shape we'll frolic with
The gods
Someone grab Fermat another drink to stop his shouting
Ask him what the other scholars think.
If your margins are the missing link, I'll buy you paper
Someone grab Fermat another drink
And so the story ends without the world collapsing on itself
And my computer started flashing
And when I checked the net I found that I accumulated wealth
So I almost started laughing.

You broke the stare that I had found myself a comfort zone into
It wasn't funny but the act of wasting money was tradition
And present company had narrowed all the options left to do

a recent study asked the laymen all their opinions
And with a small degree of error they were all the same
And there was nothing left to feel
For us to know the pain, the pleasure, the highs, the lows
And there was no one left who cared enough to make the claim

and now the future was free
And the present exciting (cmon)
As we both began to sacrifice the past in effigy

the mood was daring so we spent the evening sharing our convictions
Uneasy moments quickly shifted conversation back to you
And though we're grinning I can see a fresh beginning of dissention
Although the awkwardness of make-believe was hardly something new

it seemed the perfect time to start up with a new addiction
To pass the time obsessing over something new
Soon there was nothing left to feel
For us to know the pain, the pleasure, the highs, the lows
And the time we spent in silence was the last thing left to do

and now the future was free
And the present exciting (cmon)
As we both began to sacrifice the past in effigy

it was degrading but I was appreciating the attention (yea)
The simple words and gestures were the safety that we hide behind
It wasn't spoken but the time elapse has broken the affection

Tonight

Focus on a feeling
I've detected while I'm sleeping
Sing a chorus of 'on broadway'
And deny it all

You are in my vision
I can't turn my face
You are in my vision
I can't move my eyes
You are in my vision
I can't move at all
You are in my vision

Delicate bodies
That decay beneath their clothing
Play cards in an empty house 
In Paris

The wreckage of a hero
Lies broken in the corner
And everyone pretends
They like to live that way

You are in my vision
I can't turn my face
You are in my vision
I can't move my eyes

I can't move at all

Empty faces that never quite die

Nothing is real
If you break down and cry they won't even stare

And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

Now the light fades out
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought I remembered you

So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals
And issues
And things that I just don't understand
Like a white lie that night
Or a slight touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway
Please sit down
A candle lit a shadow on a wall near the bed

But, are 'friends' electric?

He watches

And if the 'friends' all go home
You know love needs no disguise

He dances
And we realised
Remember
Love needs no disguise

In simple embraces
They lie
In darkness
Love needs no disguise

Forget the reasons and fame
There's no deceiving inside
You know we'll all be the same

And beaten by the vicar's wife
No-one stops to help they're far too busy

And wanders out into the street
I saw her going down underneath
A thousand people's running feet

Bombers fight at zero

All the junkies pulling needles from their arms
Hope it lasts all night
And all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army
And prepare to fight
In silent bars, in silent rooms, in silent cars

And me I know just where you are, you see

'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl 
Just don't tell I'll give you

You trade yours for candy after church is through 
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)

But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together

Tuck & Patti,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights
Almost left behind
A suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me I can't hear
What you have said
And you say go slow
I've fallen behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
 
After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering
If I'm okay

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look, and you will find me

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace

It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

Tuck Andress,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Would not get a thing

Sneaking out the back door 
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine

'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl 
Just don't tell I'll give you

You trade yours for candy after church is through 
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy) 
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall

and hope the work just disappears.
If I don't lift a finger long enough,
everyone is bound to forget about me.
Excuses come to me so easily. It's so easy these days.

Maybe I can keep this one up long enough
for everyone to just forget about me.
I'm looking back, straight back,
tell me now who chose the right road?
Me, or that that kid whose a success.
Maybe I found something tht I found more enjoyable,
something known as happiness.
So pull the needles from your eyes,
because being out of my mind is being out of sight,

Ninety-Nine percent of our time.

And so much pain

the faces of the passers-by, staring faces, broken blinds,
I recall the situation clearly standing in a crowded car,
I can feel the need in me.

Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.

I still see that vision of delight,
While cruising on the black of night,
but she keeps a step ahead
Looking out the corner of her world, nobody ever knows a girl,
who once lived along this way.

Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.

Desolation degradation row, 
Go on don't let the feeling show,
She's a ten a penny dream,
Faces with no name no address, keep staring in on my distress
But she kills me with her smile.

Riding the night, searching for what is gone,
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.",Nightrider,1977

That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job
But instead they hating on what I've been doing
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning
If the flight is private, we probably should board it
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go
Started small but now we all in them bigger game
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid

Then the haters came
But we still rise above

My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille
And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga

The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo
I work they thighs, and they kegels

Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'

Doing features while watching a double feature nigga
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check
I take nothin' and make somethin' there's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'
Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight
So don't reach out cause I peaced out when I reached out
There's no response like knockin' on an empty house

Túlio Dek,"Leva na brincadeira
Não leve a mal
Nem tudo é de primeira
Nem tudo é banal
Uma vida só é perfeita
Quando chega no final

O que passou, passou
Não volta nunca mais
O que passou, passou
E só experiência traz
Por isso que eu não vivo de passado
Sigo olhando pra frente
Com Deus do meu lado
Falar que vai correr atrás do tempo perdido
Falar que vai fazer o que não tinha conseguido
São meros desejos
Sonhos que já passaram
Pessoas que passam a vida se culpando porque erraram
Mas a parada é sempre olhar pra frente
Manter a cabeça fria
Mesmo embaixo do Sol quente
Junto com o DJ em cima da batida
Vou mandando a letra
Eu vou mandando a minha rima
O que se leva dessa vida
É a vida que se leva
Se tu vacilar então já era
E nessa levada
Eu vou levando a minha vida
E não tô nem aí se alguém duvida
Se a vida é guerra
Então vou guerrear
Se é zoação
Então deixa eu zoar
E se no Arpex eu relaxo
Vou relaxar
E se na Lapa eu batalho
Quero batalhar
E se o mar 'tá bombando
Então eu vou surfar
E se os homens 'tão dando mole
Por que não aproveitar?
Se vai rolar a festa
Vamos festejar
Se a barra 'tá pesada
Vamos segurar
Se o mundo acabar
Vou improvisar
Se só amor faz bem
Então deixa eu amar
Se eu amor é falso
Então sai pra lá
Se não tiver humildade
É melhor parar
Se tudo der errado
Então deixa eu te ajudar
Mas se eu pegar no mic
Não peça pra eu parar
Se o mundo é sujo
Quem sou eu para mudá-lo
Se o tempo é curto
Quem sou eu para encurtá-lo
Não deixo minhas palavras
Escorrerem pelo ralo
Porque minha mente é consciente
E eu não calo
Não quero nem saber se vou ser julgado
Se eu errei, foda-se o meu passado
Porque escrevo a letra
E passo o sentimento
Quem passa o sentimento
'Tá ligado e é atento
Nadar contra a corrente
É voar contra o vento
Seja o meu som
Pesado ou lento
Se no teu recalque é onde eu cresço
Eu só lamento
Minha voz quebra o muro de Berlim
E não me contento
São como flechas de fogo
Que rasgam o espaço
Sem se quer desviar das nuvens
Deixam rastro

Nem Angelina Joly
Sou uma mensageira

All the love we had, blank stare like you forgot
I used to love the sight of you
Now I can't stand the sight of you

Can't believe we're through

That amazing smile has been lost for a while
Now everything's a mess, still not one regret

I have too many flaws.
No shining night in armour,
I'll never be your star.

Than to lie in the light..
Rather be the one you love,
Than who you lie like you know my secrets

I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys

But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk

Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine

And left me here tonight
All alone with my drink as I sit and think
That maybe you were right

I wanna feel the way I felt the first time
I wanna feel the way I felt when your lips first touched mine
I wanna feel my heart and know that it's still there
Go back tot he start and see if you still care
Want you to feel my heart and know that I'm still here

I'm slurring my words, all the faces are blurred
I guess I should call it a day
I'm still down at the bar and I can't find my car

Every time the jukebox plays
My favorite songs and I don't have
No one to sing along with

When ya never been so low

And track me down in Mexico

Tunde,"Hey, so you threw your heart right in
And it turned out less than perfect
A losing streak is starting in your mind
You let yourself believe the pain

It's never going to be worth it
Don't beat yourself up
Know that you were never wrong for wishful thinking
So now that you've lost the battle
Should we just cross out your name and let you sink?

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling like the last surviving great romantic,
Just stop the dreaming and the world stops spinning around
You feel foolish 'cause love never turns out
Like you planned it
Stop believing and the world stops letting you down.

So you had to let it go
It clearly wasn't working
New love leaves you trembling
You hide behind the door

So unsure of what you used to know
So now you think your every move ten steps ahead and you are frozen
Caught inside yourself
You're drowning as the anger overflows....

Passing the hours how I just lose track of time

Left it all behind
It's a charge I can't deny

I can see you face to face and
We can both kick back and have a conversation
About this ingenious system you created called love.
Oh God how I love to love you
And spend time with you
That leads me into a state of gratitude
For choosing me to give your love to
God you got me wanting to",So High,2007
Tunes,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy - Harmonica [Version],2007

Heeeeey
What's happenin, y'all?
This is Tyrone Chillinfoot down with the funky Tung Twista, baby
[number] inches of straight stupid, straight ignorant dope funky stuff for ya, baby
So turn up your radio and get down to the Tung Twista
Kick it, gee

Let the Cavalier Tung kiss ya, it's the Mista Tung Twista
Pumpin a rhythm, a lyrical styler
My tongue'll be flingin a funky pile of
Lyrical rhymes that's breakin em off in the mind, I be flowin em holy, I'm 
Kickin the funky Islam, my lyricals slippin em like petroleum, slowly I'm
Pumpin the flow of the lyric, I'm breakin em off with the radical texture
I'm one brother you could never get next ta
Flex your style, I'm gonna give em a lyrical pump of the rhythm of Cav
And crackin em up with the word of the wise
I be bringin em up in the flow of the funky dialect
I elect a flow for suckers that try a wreck
I spark the light of a head and be wakin em up and then cause a fly effect
I insist ya lay with the path of my rhythm and follow me like a scripture
Flowin this from my lung, a tongue twister
Mista, my style'll be makin a dent and be leavin the tracks bent
Steppin is the lyrical black gent, my Nubian accent
Breakin em up and then makin em take in the smell of my funk I be kickin up in em 
And then I'ma give em a lick of my lyrical lollypop, I'm gonna bring em into my doctrine
Rock, then the rhythm'll makin the clock spin blackwards
The funk of the rhythm'll snap, crackle and pop, then flow, oh 
I'm makin em follow the path of a God and my track'll be blacker than Cocoa
This lyric I'm makin is dope, don't call it so-so
Don't dis the Tung Twista
Leavin the suckers soft as a whisper, Tung kiss ya like a sister
Then I'ma let it be known that it's the way that I throw
That's makin the funk of the lyrical glow
And how I tell it, yo Cav is kickin a funkedelic flow, and oh, my fist'll
Swing at the rhythm of suckers, then I'm gonna give em a Tung blister
It's the Mista Tung Twista

Ha-ha-heeey
Boy, that's Tung Twista for ya
Comin at ya in 3d
Ha-ha-ha
??? funkier than that, boy
Check it out
Kick it again

My tongue is spinnin 
I follow with Allah and the Father be stoppin the Cavalier from sinnin
The lyrical rhythm beginning and then in the endin
I ratatattat tactics, give em black kicks
Flow of the lyric I'm pumpin and rappin em up is dope as a crack fix 
Wack? It's - funky, I'm greater
Never to step at the lyrical dictator, a state of
Shock is what I put a sucker into, then to mentally
Go with the smell I be stylin, gee, funky is what the scent'll be
Harmin this? Uh-uh, the Cavalier's kickin my charm in this
Simply because I'm in this, I'm as dope as a pharmacist
Calmin this? Hype as a rattle be shakin and rippin the rhythm 
And breakin up into a sweat, I be workin the lyrical servin a sucker 
So never come near a, lyricist Cavalier - ah
Rock the flow of the lyrical rhythm be shinin like a mirror
Hear a sucker step at the Twist, ya gotta be goin like this to beat me
The funk of the lyric will flow from me like peepee
You caught a work of my tongue as I be flow flowin like water
Crackin em up with a flow and sort of slaughter I oughta
????? I'm bracin Nubian nations, race and chasin
My tongue your tastin, a quick pace and facin lyrical wastin
Tungs'll be cut like Jason, racin 
Tung Twista rocks, your lip'll lock
My tongue'll be makin a tick tick or tick tock to Nubian hip-hop
Flip-flopped, a flow when I wrote this
Kickin and makin some hocus pocus, focus
Tongue will be flippin just like this I'ma locus
Givin a diagnosis for Twisterosis
Crackin a mouth and them makin em ache I'ma put em up into a coma
You're sniffin dope aroma
I'm blendin 
I'm able to break up a sucker that you might send in 
The funk of the lyrical rhythm beginnin 
Spinnin the suckers around like a dollar 
Be makin em holler kickin the funk of a lyrical scholar
I pray to Allah, I'm makin this funky like I'm a hobo
Throw better than bolo, ya thinkin that he can battle my solo
Just say oh no cause that's a no-no
When I be smellin the funk of my flow, jo
I'm pumpin this up and breakin this in with a lyrical, then say haha
Take titles, then say ta-ta
I'm rippin a rap and then rockin a rhythm and ring in my tongue I'ma bend em
And flow with a lyric it's steppin inside em
And get with the funk I be pumpin up in em
With this and it's the
Yeah - Tung Twista

Oooooweee
Haa-haa
Boy, if that ain't bad, my name ain't Lewis Tyrone Chillinfoot, baby
Haa-haa
But we finna get the Boogieman ????
Go head, kid

The Boogieman was speaking, he said, what's up Mista Twista
Don't you know that Nubians ain't never supposed to whisper
Talkin behind my back is makin it seem like it's a rumor
So tell me fact to face when you can decide to come to Juma
Don't say your name backwards because you don't like Cav
Played to the left by def and I'm gonna eff up the right half
The sucker descendant of Canaan, I'ma let my pizzazz wreck
I'm speakin this to the devil that calls his self an Aztec
You ain't a Puerto-Rican, know what I'm speakin, Islam you're seekin
You might as well open the doors of a church and become a deacon
Don't step to me, speakin the pep to me about what your rep'll be
Crept to me because I let them see that you had leprosy
Them suckers that be dissin me I simply just insist ya
Stop steppin against the Mista Tung Twista

He-heeey
Now that was bad, baby
But if you think that was somethin
Wait till you hear the album

relaxin maxin to the maximum
to tracks a hum
the wicks where the stacks are from
inside the styles of a funky lyrical wiz
what a miracle is
get down to spiritual business
now my tongue kissed
put words in your system wished em
respect the blackness em
give in em win em the peace they want
but don't want the peace signs unless its in the mind
become a victim because i kick em sick em
supposed to be black but they be wack
those who pretend to be a muslim i gooshed em
positive ones i pushed em
into the path or righteousness might get dissed
those who pump a fist but ain't right with this
i increase rhymes wacks and weak minds
if it ain't real stop throwin up peace signs

(chorus 2x)
don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
untied we can get over, yet were still apart

terror wished em ima terrorize elorize in disguise
those for side for tizin and i begin
to creepin seepin thought out unrighteousness and dissed
connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness
figured they manifestin g i can address
individually each emcee is throwin up peace but don't pray to the east
i write the lect the soul should be playin towards mecca
but snakes and devils won't letcha
freestyle some religious free dump see
to letcha know how come dumb some be
ignorance a comish to look like a fish
and since we whipped from bars to a ghetto priz
ima wiz some brains i give em a brain washin
when I'm walkin devils I'm squashin
science fiction mixed in tricks in fixin
the ways of all sort for good
come in my fortress ima gonna force this
'cause it holy don't try to fold me
some just say peace tryin to the black guy
some say peace thinkin it means bye bye
so g if ya never mean this from the heart and the mind
stop throwin up peace signs

(chorus)

lets walk the path of a vo-cab-ulary
you'll cary the thoughts of every righteous man
lets fight this plan of a other man
waxin thoughts of a brother man
satans waitin for us to be hatin each other
sister brother or mother color
blackness don't try to attack this fact this lets now practice
true peace new salon one who is a peace
cease when you see hunger than give peace
blacks a supplied them and applied them identified them
you suffer inhale and say why them
'cause you did not follow the path that i laid out
say blackness and get played out
like children wildin some try to kick a fist
pick a fist i take a piss wikedness to get crushed up
movin up on that bustop while stand inhale bustop
so you must stop
fakin the holy faith in wakin
star don't come apart our hearts get a stake in
so don't be mad so what minds to the minimum
'cause in the em sendin em holy wisdom
to let you know from the heart and the mind

Tung Twista,"Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse One:

I need...mo money mo money mo, suck 'em fast suck 'em slow
Even though I gotta pay my bills I'm still on the streets
tryin' to keep it real
Pass that shit let me take a hit, hopin' this money ain't
counterfeit
Give 'em 211 get 'em in line and let 'em 20 so(?)
Cut that money let's be up, which you want to ride, the
Benz or the Truck
Back up, get on the one way 'cause more Sundays hotter than Monday
Often gettin' trailed by cops, gotta get away by hittin them blocks
Got my glock, never stick middle finger up my ass, known to blast
Keep me down, where I'm from I'm known to clown
Get a dub off a nine, go get a sack, I'm back, pro black
achiever, leave her, thug and ashtray
More to the fact I'm back to the scene, let in the wonder
let all the smoke out
And if Luke coulda broke out
Gotta make more stacks of these, so I Z's for bud in
the breeze, ain't spittin' cheese
What a freak want to trip off, sip off the lame with the
game, get sick of the man who point the blame
Still a P-O, P-I,M-P, we be P-A,P-E-R...chase

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse 2:

You see my nice Mom smokin', money slopin' 'tween my fo
with open arms when my option is to my mission it's a paperchase
So when you face to face: mom and dollar, keep to the
streets, hit the joints like hollow
Boy better figure if you owe them, better low then
With po-po corruption on the phone double 1-9-1-87, with
a couple of zeros
I'm sittin' there makin' dollars
Verse 2 G, nigga didn't want to holler
Back to the streets again, but a nigga want to go there
The game treatment so fair
Crucial, in neutral, all eyes on me I'm brutal, choppin'
up that paper like you know
Gotta click since I call them blue notes
Shippin' that paper from Earth to Pluto
Get that new song
Nineteen ninety-six we be paperchasin'!

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse 3:

I'm...checkin' paper like a hunter, Belo
Had dreams about runnin' four to the floor
O.G.s in my house me in the clause
Nigga want cheese, nigga want more
Bumpin' all the good shit 'cause all the good shit makes
you forget about the bad bit
Now you make a nigga match wits
Never want what I never had, 'cause I never had shit
The basketball, the all, the ounce, bounce, A to the motherfucking K
I smoke the bead but they keep on calling me and they
want my apology
And they fall, see it's unexplainable how money's unattainable
if you play in this game
So nigga never call me names when I aim the gun but holler:
A to the motherfucking K with a motherfucking spray-ay-ay
A to the motherfucking K with a spray-ay-ay
It's 95 keep your ass out the line-up
Why don't you keep the double-time up, pimp keep them lines up
Help 'em talk to shiner, give me the best wish
The paperchase be for me 'cause you got blasted with
an eighth of a key
Niggas be be-comin' up but come or stay away
And I'll let you take your fate with three...
Bullets to the chest, put your body rest
If you know P-gang going for the G-Style
Never relax, realize don't give a one-too-many free packs
Come check your ho to see I'm a G
I-get in a sick dream
Paid to pick teams in a room full of dick fiends
Much love to thugs who sacrifice their life to get greens
for the troop of 15, what the shit mean?
It's you bitch, you better save your breath, 'cause you
can't count how many days is left
Let the weed smoke, blaze, but check, until I'm ready to wreck
Then a motherfucker gonna be paid to death
Because I'm goin' on a paperchase

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Sipping Seagram, chewing on a wheat stem
Touching on my four fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with three, one, two, seven, six, two, ten
Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the bead, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes want to snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe, to the crib

Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'Lo
Introduce myself, a to the motherfucking K finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and em
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls
'Cause they thinking about sampling em

We're learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Mm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the see-A
D-I, Double-L, with ah A-see, A-see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
'Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
'Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels Girbaud flexing one five oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat
Let's have me in the cab betcha mess with ya young ass
Smoking on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last

Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the Oprah lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when out of me gotta be
Right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk come on suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, want to see what that'd be like
I know you want to try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you bow down?
Where your ride at? On the passenger side of your hoes
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbing me with lotion
She come like an ocean coasting have a cigarette thinking
Me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be giving women dick in the bed
Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the Feds or spitting game
But it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a player do
Then be little in a day or two
After words I'm slay a crew, now that's some pimp type shit
That be	Low and AK'll do, wearing gray and blue
If a hoe want to holler then you a player if you hit them ends
And get the dividends but you a pimp if you can get

La taule ouvre des réseaux parallèles sur Paname
Ils sont trop jeunes pour l'hallal mais y'a pas d'âge pour l'haram
CC ou cool-al', tout est hardcore, ça devient banal
Ça vend la mort, mais à part ça, ça mange hallal
Qui n'aime pas l'oseille, et les faux-culs m'écœurent
Que mes mots n'touchent pas tes oreilles, mais te transpercent le cœur

Des yeux pour pleurer, une joue à tendre
Liberté envolée, tu les as laissés la prendre
J'vais grogner et cogner, mon cul n'est pas à vendre
Désolé, et j'vais pas m'immoler pour m'faire entendre

Lourdes sont les baloches, l'respect est obligatoire
Quatre portables dans la sacoche sous commission rogatoire
Les murs ont des oreilles, l'commissaire veut tout savoir
Parfois les potes de la veille auraient besoin d'un bavoir
Les parents désespèrent, les condés sont détestés
La virginité s'perd aussi souvent que le respect
Fuck tes belles promesses, j'me débrouille moi-même
La seule fin heureuse que j'connaisse, c'est la fin d'la semaine
Et nique sa race, j'ai plus l'temps d'être peace
J'prends de la place comme une liasse en billet d'dix
Et j'range mes sourires, j'apprends à être triste
À croire qu't'es obligé d'chialer quand t'es un artiste
Et l'amour du risque : faire du hors-piste les yeux bandés
Ce qui consiste à sortir un disque en indé'
Et se blinder, face à l'ennemi
Et pas là pour mendier, arrêter d'glander
Pour l'appel à la prière, y'a personne, c'est con
Quand Nabilla dit ""Allô"" y'a tout le monde qui répond
À l'école de la rue, il n'ont qu'des mauvais professeurs
Y'a que l'oseille et les culs qui servent d'anti-dépresseurs
On s'en sort comme on peut, d'la drogue dans du cello'
Vaut mieux récup' ton fils au comico qu'ta fille au tel-hô
Ils font les mecs sympas mais ont de drôle d'idées
Ils n'attendent qu'un faux-pas pour mieux te lapider

Les genoux écorchés, les visages couverts de poussière

Vie ordinaire quand l'quotidien est établi
Dans son imaginaire, il a son petit monde à lui
Oui lui aussi veux jouer comme si c'était une grande bataille d'eau
Comme sous ses duvets quand il déplace ses G.I. Joe!
Et dans son jeu, il met les méchants en prison
Il bombarde des innocents comme il bombarde sa maison

Ouh ouh ouh il aime les insulter de singes!
Enfant de banlieue que sa couleur a détruit
Qui vit dans la peur, dans l’odeur et le bruit
Et le cœur en conflit, les idées assombries
Il ira jusqu’au bout quitte à mourir incompris
Et tout ce qu’il accomplit n’est que violence, injures et abus
Malveillance quand l’individu est barbu
Oui, il a arrêté l’chanvre, fini d’se cloîtrer dans sa chambre
Pour lui, tout a changé depuis le 11 Septembre
Depuis et tout va mal, il les insulte de bâtards
Haine viscérale envers ces hommes qui disent ""Allahu akbar""
Il ne voit que des Salafistes en pleine recrudescence
Des bâtons d’explosifs qui prient dans les rues
Sa France n’est plus qu’un triste reflet immonde
Pas l’pays des droits de l’homme, mais la poubelle du monde
Et tant de clichés
Mais est-ce que ce monde est sérieux?
Mais qui est vraiment ce jeune de banlieue?",Jeune de tess,2014
Tunisiano,"Y'a pas grand chose à faire, donc fais-le bien
Si je suis ton frère, tu es le mien
À l'édifice je mets ma pierre si on est plein
Si on agit, on opère, on est la France de demain
Un mal qui empiète, distribue des étiquettes
Qui enlève le côté honnête, qui détruit et qui entête
Victime de c'que je reflète, nouveau mal de ce siècle
Le mal de mes ancêtres, une maladie qui me guette
J'ai touché le stylo, le cœur avide
Pour tartiner des mots au goût acide
Je suis français, celui qu'on néglige
J'aime mon pays, pas ceux qui le dirigent
Les gens sont sans pitié, de leçon sont des donneurs
Si faux-cul était un métier, y'aurait pas beaucoup d'chômeurs
Abrutis par l'quotidien, la chatte et l'euro
Ne sont pas pro-Palestiniens mais ils sont pro-B2O
Instrumentalisés pour que les minorités se reconnaissent
Et pour paraître honnêtes, donnent la parole à deux-trois marionnettes
Afin de nous valoriser, excusez-moi, c'est des broutilles
France d'en-bas ne ressemble pas à Rachida ou Malek Boutih
Noirs ou Blancs, ils ressemblent à tes frelons
L'aspect du sympathisant, mais le discours du colon
Les vrais penseurs n'sont pas dans vos débats télévisés
Juste quelques collabeurs qui parlent au nom d'une communauté
Diaboliser le Musulman comme l'a fait Nicolas
Oui, ils font le ramadan, mais vous rackettent vos pains au chocolat
Du coup les braves gens ont peur, ont la haine qui s'éveille
Voient en chaque maghrébin un Mohammed Merah qui sommeille
Et là, le mal est fait, traumatisés
Les mêmes qui nous manipulent diront d'pas généraliser
Outil de désinformation fixé au téléviseur
Communication faite pour jouer avec nos peurs
Et ça marche, pour un rien, on se clashe
Dans la terreur, on se cache
Et sur l'étranger, on crache
Et t'oublies tout l'reste, vu qu'tu bloques sur un détail
Ta vie régresse pendant qu'tu broutes comme du bétail
Ils focalisent ton attention, t'es tombé dans leur manège
T'en fais une fixation, pendant qu'ils sucrent tes privilèges
Et l'pire, c'est qu'ils ne reconnaissent pas leurs fautes
Ils arriveront à dire que le problème vient des autres
Et les autres, c'est toi, c'est moi, des jeunes en colère
Et la France ressemble pas à un dimanche chez Drucker
Y'a des gens qui galèrent, que vous laissez aboyer
Cinq personnes pour un salaire, dur de payer un loyer
Noyés sous des tonnes de problèmes, le monde est stone
Y'a des mendiants et des roms, des mecs qui dorment dans l'tro-m'
Pendant qu'vous festoyez
Personne n'vient leur prêter main forte
Donc voyez tout le mépris que je vous porte

Ils ont les oreilles qui sifflent
Ils ont les oreilles qui sifflent
Ils ont les oreilles qui sifflent

Petit capitaliste, dicte-moi mes codes
Instrumentalise ma foi et mes dogmes
À ta guise, prends-nous pour des saltimbanques
Idéalise ta morale régie par la loi des banques
Par la loi des tanks, tu vises le profit
Tu divises, déguises tes intentions et mets les gens en conflit
Ta devise n'est que boursière, pille une nation
Pour quelques actionnaires et un taux d'inflation
Choisis tes adversaires imaginaires, des religieux actifs
Tendancieux, on oublie qu'une guerre c'est lucratif
Des tyrans aspirant à prendre ce qu'on détient
Ils vont attaquer l'Iran et dire qu'c'est pour notre bien
Les médias font semblant, complices de leurs tromperies
Ont choisi leur camp et oriente le conflit
C'est les gentils hippies qui disent aimer l'Coran
Et par dépit, jouent à SimCity au Proche-Orient
Ils nous délivrent du mal, d'une utopie
Aujourd'hui, être libre dépend d'la puissance du lobby
Tu cries à l'infamie, t'aimerais changer les choses, tant pis
T'as vite compris qu'ici on n'écoute pas les pauvres, vu qu'ils
Manient les mots, t'es forcément parano, démago
Hors propos, qui vient crier au complot
Eh oui, si l'assassin est maghrébin, c'est qu'il fait son jihad
Si l'assassin est norvégien, il est juste fou et malade
Qui sert de pansement? 
Qui sert de bouclier?
Le Musulman, la France des oubliés
Le bon exemple est celui qui gère l'info
La haine n'a plus besoin d' ""Mein Kampf"", elle a Charlie Hebdo
Mais dans l'fond, qu'est-c'que tu y peux vraiment?
À part t'indigner, n'pas être indifférent?
Faire le bon samaritain, ça paye pas, my men
T'es pas Robin des Bois, faut déjà s'en sortir soi-même
Y'a l'Africain, le Noiche, y'a la lutte des classes
Toute l'année, tu craches, y'a le chômage de masse
Les factures qui s'entassent, la justice qui avorte
À la ramasse, comment n'pas balayer devant sa porte?
Fatigué de faire le moulin à vent
L'impression d'me répéter constamment
Tu vas faire quoi si on t'enlève tes droits?
À part taper un coup d'gueule et faire la grève du mois?

L’Haÿ-les-Roses ou Orly, la DH ou Saint-Denis
Torturé par les non-dits, tout ces trucs qu'on s'est promis
Déception est immense quand de l'amour t'en as trop mis
Ces choses que j'ai omis de faire, j'ai commis mon frère
Et pas mal d'erreurs dont je suis peu fier
Insoumis, déters, quand les billets verts t'ont salis
Te font oublier que l'amitié c'est ghali
Quand sans repères tu grandis, tu voles où tu mendies
Tes compères de galère bah tu t'en fais une famille
Et destinés à régner pas le seul dans ma sère-mi
On se serre les coudes pour être plus forts face à l'ennemi
Dans la jungle des bandits, t'apprends à t'y faire
C'est pas le monde de Candy, t'es Simba ou t'es Bambi
Et on se tue entre frères, on fait des safaris
Oui on chasse le mammifère comme dans Daktari
On était petits et fous, dans le coup, dans l'kiffe
Et sans un sou, sans une fouffe juste le cul d'un splif'
Dans le vif du sujet, on prend nos premières cuites
Tout va trop vite au QG, donc on apprend à gruger
Et jeunes sauvages, le regard dans les abysses
Plein de rage, à l'âge où on n'sait que s'balader à dix
Fuck l'école, les flics, on en fait une pierre deux coups
On cherche notre virilité à travers une paire de couilles
Violence gratuite, devant les potes c'est trop tard pour renoncer
T'es pas une fiotte, mais tu pigeras que t'aurais pas du commencer
Après coup, tenir les murs quand y'a qu'ça à l'horizon
Pour beaucoup, ils se changent en mur d'prison
Évident, amour et haine ensemble on fait les deux
À ciel ouvert, on purge nos peines face à Dieu
On brise nos chaînes comme on peut
Un bout de teu-teu à consumer
Puis t'ouvres les yeux puis tu vois qu'tes rêves sont partis en fumée

Si on se disait tout
On effaçait les doutes
Toutes ces vieilles rancœurs qu'on a en travers de la gorge

Y'a que dans la douleur que la vraie amitié se forge

Candidats au suicide, à la soif de liquide on crache dans l'anti-pop
Sécheresse aride on a toujours pas l'antidote
On prend quelques rides sans même s’alarmer là, à cramer des clopes
On sort armés, cran d'arrêt et capotes
Mais le ventre est vide
On est lucide on sait qu'les pigeons picorent
Ils nous dénigrent mais on rêve d'inverser l'score
Regard acide, quand de l'autre côté du périph' faut un Visa
Un look, un défrisage pour ça qu'ils nous dévisagent
Arrogants, on a nos torts, avides donc on s'invite
Milite pour ton équipe, fous le del-bor et le slogan
En bande, on refait le monde, ça parle de chatte et d'émeute
Il a suffit d'une blonde et un chien a quitté la meute
Certains s'égarent, il est trop tard pour lutter

Embrouilles pour des clopinettes, il manque quelqu'un devant le photographe

On est tellement stupides, plus les ennuis s'confondent
Cupide de cette saloperie qui dirige le monde
Quand on était mioches, c'était à la vie à la mort, c'est moche
Quand tu comprends que ton meilleur ami c'est ta poche
D'abord, en conflit, t'mets des cartouches dans le chargeur
T'apprends à compter tes amis, du pouce jusqu'au majeur
Même si nos points commun ont changé, t'es pas infréquentable
Pas pour autant un étranger, t'es le bienvenu à ma table
Jeune gamin, mais l'amitié fait des siennes
Le temps est assassin, une ignoble esthéticienne
Fais comme il te convient, pourquoi ton sourire est crispé

As I ask them

I went so quick it makes you shudder that I'm gone
Are we so brittle has your soul turned into stone
And though you loved me I'm not Jenny in the night
Jenny
Some decisions don't thread back to being right

Your head blurs quickly tonight
Your edges diffuse in the light
Don't tell me that your throat is getting tight

Change your name and find a job
Marry Jenny in the spring
Buy a dog and call him Pete
Push the children on the swings
Think about me now and then
Try to find a peaceful space
Count the days as they go by
Count the lines upon your face

Your heart beats quick and strong
Your mind pores over it all
Don't worry because no one saw me fall

These things they make us sentimental inside
Your words are gelignite
Or just another sentimental aside

We're catching bullets in our teeth
And though it's easy when you know how it's done
They split the secret up six ways before they gave it to us just before dawn
And now we don't remember

Our blood and guts are out
We spread our bones across the table at night
We cut our fingers off
To give ourselves those little extra insights

We're catching bullets in our teeth

They always do
They spill the secret out six ways
And beg for our forgiveness

It's hard to do but they're so sweet
And if they take a couple out
We try to work things out

In such endless night

So sweet to lose a friend
You leave the church and taste
The air in your lungs
Old lies and fireflies
Carve angels on your eyes
And all is undone
You whisper prayers into the dark
Up to a god in whom you've never believed
You always do
You split the secret up six ways
But it won't make it any easier to see
And now we don't remember

On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

I fixed me some food, then go the hell out

I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me

Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it

(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls

You watchin' but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
Of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit

What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga bellt
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
With a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run, best be prepared
For the Outlawz, here we come

They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas cradle wit a knife in your navel
Rap-related criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
Till the end, I'm tellin all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But the shit ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up

For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge

Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy

Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin' with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a short I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth

The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes

For each other, cause we closer than brothers

When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies

Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me

Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change

And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass

Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain

I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you, a bitch again

Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feelin pain, things are not the same

Keep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon

Tupac Shakur,"I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven)

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin'' in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin' visions
Of leavin'' here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin'' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die, 
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin'' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin'' me, in my sleep
Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I.. tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door,  shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)

Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Bitch talked to every snitch, they jeapordized me gettin' rich
Only fifteen at a spot full of rock teens
Full of hard knocks, ready to clock, FUCK the cops (yeah!)

And we was fat like Trump
Every nigga packed a pump, so time to be poppin trunks
I stood at the top of the organization
Ready to pop a cop with no hesitations (fuck the police) yeah

I learned from my mistakes I'm twenty-one now

Ain't old enough to save but I behave just like a true vet
That's cause for all the dirt I did and dirt I didn't do yet

Tryin' to pop my pistol for a profit
Copper tried to stop I didn't drop and so he got it (yeah)
And I don't give a fuck about it
(Ah-yo you think you'll ever quit this shit?) I doubt it

So why not take all of me
'Cause I just love to be the nigga that nobody else has the balls to be
These suckers always searchin' for me, with funk
They in a hurry to get buried with they locs up

And once I let my gun pop
Another motherfucker drops
I smoke a gang of buddha better yet some indo
Crack through your window, nigga where the fuck the ya-yo?

As I sit back and rake my, dough in
I let my money grown in just got rich off what they owin, huh
And flippin' hoes, there's no open
Keepin' a sister broke I'd rather take it from the token (give it up)

A psychopath when provoked then
All you see is smoke I pull a pistol from my, coat
I told you we ain't havin' it (come here)
Give up the dough, reached for his coat, started grabbin' it

Bang bang! Was the sound as I jetted
A bullet in the head so the sucker don't forget it
But I knew that I'd be dead soon
Crime in my head, makin' decisions in my bedroom

I see task at my front do' (ahh shit)
But I ain't goin' alive, so what the fuck these niggas come for
Just because you got a vest don't mean you escape from death (bitch)
I put this AK to your chest it'll take your entire breath

Threw a grenade in the front yard
Six cops lunged then got crunched, here they come God
The other cops are closin' in
Deja vu, what do I do, here we go again (here we go again)

Tupac Shakur,"Verse 1:
(scarface)
Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makin' music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggaz

(chorus x6)

This is for my homies and my thug niggaz (uuuuugh)

Verse 2
(master p)
'face, imagine us working at mcdonald's
And me and you selling fucking tapes in the bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggaz
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggaz off from new orleans to california
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c.e.o.'s in a suit and tie
But we young niggaz in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

Chorus x6

Verse 3:
(doracell)
It's alive, and I'mma be tha muhfuckin' one
Make these niggas want some
Here I come
Da last don
Niggaz steady claiming this
Tatted on my wrist since 86
What tha fuck?
I'm sitting in my cell block stuck
Listening to this shit my radio did
Shit, gotta change the situation
Write a letta to the warden mothafuck all this time wasting
Chasin' niggas wit my occupation
Clean across the nation
Lookin' for two-facin
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope-dealer all in one
Now past me my muthafuckin' gun
Niggaz feelin' they invinsible
Til' they dealin' wit tha muthafuckin' principle

See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it

You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway

I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that

Please, ain't nothing left to say to you

I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me, got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothing to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

[Intro]
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it"", cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""go to the telly, ho""
Equipped with money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smoking bomb ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustling and prayers, to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishing
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressing (booyah!)
I'mma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes, to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart, strapped up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hoping you listen I catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrificing
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man, you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's yo nigga right beside ya
Hoping you listening, catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah",Ambitionz as a Ridah,1996

Tupac Shakur,"Ay what time is it nigga?
(""I don't know."") Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
(""Hell yeah."") Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room (""Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?"")
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs (""Where K and them niggas at man?"")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around (""Ay, y'all seen my shoes?"")
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin or y'all flyin' back, whassup?
(""Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit."")
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(""Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga."") Aw nigga
Damn

Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

We gotta go  (gotta go, gotta go)
We gotta go (yeah baby) (it's check it out time)
We gotta go (let's go nigga, gotta go)
We gotta go (Y'all know what time it is!) (Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man)
We gotta go (call that valet motherfucker, tell him to get a nigga shoe)
We gotta go ('cause we out this, motherfucker)

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
'Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
'Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

We gotta go (ayo man Pac ay)
We gotta go (where the where the fuck is Daz at man?)
We gotta go (This nigga locked up or somethin'?)
We gotta go (The only one not to leave) (yo man)
We gotta go (it's check out time it's time to get out this mother)
We gotta go (You seem them bitches?)
We gotta go (We out man, fuck that shit)
We gotta go (Yo Rece!)
We gotta go (Yo nigga, whassup, whassup?)

Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go
We gotta go (Ay, it's check out time)
We gotta go (Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin')
We gotta go (where my shoes go, nigga?)
We gotta go (where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?)
We gotta go (Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much)
We gotta go (What the fuck y'all doin', nigga? Kurupt!)
We gotta go (go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas, c'mon man)
Niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
We gotta go (I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred)
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go

Tupac Shakur,"You find an MC like me who's strong
We leavin' muthafucka's aborted
With no verbal support

Who can we stand, the more power of game
And make it possible for me to drop 
A few to wrecks ya brain
Imagine to keep on wishin' upon a star

When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded,
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack the [?clubs?] be tired
My attempts to ride
Every time all night
I faced with the scars beyond
This beam or bar
For me to put down my guard
I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breakin' in gas with the six eight all day
In an out, with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation
My lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar
With tha nigga you facin'
We must be based on nothin'
Better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin'
No more procrastination
Give up to fate, and get that ass shakin'

Yo two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me alazhay and Chrystal
Blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it)
Tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride
Tonight's tha night

Well I comes through with two packs
Of tha bomb pro-folax
For protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shits evading the x-rays
Sending young muthafucka's to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder
I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that mutha fuckin' poisonous touch
I'm a 
MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin' Bomb Bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's in cast like Bob May

I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pimes
There's no escape
Na I ain't blastin' I use my mental
To assassinate assassin's
For those askin'
Opposed to laughin'
Raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin'
Why is that ?
Cause smilin' faces decieve
You best believe
To MC's, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night
Is when I defeat and ignite Mic's
My verbal snipe, your vocabal site
I'm out tha cut, uncut
And raw with no clause fall
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The raider rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, second, prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler
Stickin' up Jews wit German missles

Will be back after this message 
Don't touch tha dial

Now who want to test Tical

Now you claim that you get's lot
With this underground cannibis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
The proceeds like Key's
My degrees freeze cause secondtively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at your wake
I plan my escape in case J or a snake bust it

Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,

Are you afraid of a thug ? 
and have you ever made love with 
candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This Thug Passion 
help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay 
come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends 
perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life

You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that?

I put some cash in your pocket
Made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fools fate
Without your word, you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do, if it was up to you
I'd be dead now
I let the world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live until you die
See the mothafuckin' bitch in your eye
Type of Nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When you see me nigga
You better holla at me (holla at me)
Can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me nigga, you better holla at me

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

Curious spittin' lyrics, on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency, nigga that's why we're doin' this, I got set up
I surprised the niggas the way I got up and then
I hit the studio it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation this information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient it's a celebration
Of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members across the fifty states
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate ?
To live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
So much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared 'cause only the strong survive
Life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you figure fuck with me, I give that ass a try
Nigga, holla at me

Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

Now I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

I shoulda saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothers framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain, while she blame me
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen, doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision, that got me livin'
Just like an animal, I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' 'cause
Hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetery full of motherfuckers got not knowin'
Picture my prophecy the cops are attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let'em stop me 'cause I'm a soldier
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust a no no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po po

Holla at me
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me nigga

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

A nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

Niggas out there jealous 'cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate
But they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood
Yeah
With that funky sound (so funky)
We be throwin' down

Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me

Love tha way you agrivate your hips 
And push your ass out 
Gotta nigga wantin' 
It's so bad 
I'm about to pass out 
Want to dig you 
And I can't even lie about it 
Baby just eleviate your cloths 
Time to fly up out it 
Catch you at a club 
Oh shit, you got me fiendin' 
Body talken shit to me 
But I can't comprehend the meaning 
Now if ya want to roll with me 
Then here's ya chance 
Doin 80 on tha freeway 
Wait police, catch me if they can 
Forgive me I'm a ridah 
Still I'm just a simple man 
All I want is money 
Fuck tha fame 
I'm a simple man 
Mr. International 
Playa with tha passport 
Just like Alladin bitch 
Get you anything you ask for 
It's either him or me 
Champagne, Hennessy 
A favorite of my homies 
When we floss on our enemies 
Witness as we creep to a low speed 
Peep what a ho need 
Puff some more weed 
Funk, ya don't need 
Approachin' hochies with a passion 
Been a long day 
But I've been drivin' by attraction 
In a strong way 
Your body is bangin' 
Baby I love it when ya flaunt it 
Time to give it to daddy nigga 
Now tell me how you want it...

Tell me is it cool to fuck ? 
You think I come to talk 
Am I a fool or what ? 
Positions on tha floor 
It's like erotic 
Ironic 
Cause I'm somewhat psychotic 
I'm hitten' switches on bitches 
Like I been fixed with hydraulics 
Up and down like a roller coaster 
Come up beside ya 
I ain't quitin' till tha show is over 
Cause I'm a ridah 
In and out just like a robbery 
I'll probably be a freak 
And let you get ontop of me 
Get her rockin' these 
Nights full of Alazhay 
A livin' legend 
You ain't heard about these niggas played in cali days 
Deloris Tucker 
You's a muthafucker 
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga 
You destroy a brotha 
Worst than tha others 
Bill Clinton 
Mr. Bob Dole 
You too old to understand tha way tha game is told 
Your lame 
So I gotta hit you with tha high facts 
Won't someone listen ? 
Makin' millions

They want to censor me 
They ratha see me in a cell 
Livin' in hell

Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfucker,
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha

Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time,
You'll find a rhyme'll blaze you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?

But life goes on

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz
Rest in peace young nigga
There's a Heaven for a 'G'
Be a lie
If I told ya that I never thought of death

We tha last ones left
But life goes on

As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin'
In my draws
Ring, ring, ring
Quiet y'all
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
He's getting by
It's time to worry
Another brotha
Nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alcohol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall ?
Raised as G's
Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Let's get smoked out
And blaze with me
2' in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I passed out
But now that your gone
I'm in tha zone
Thinkin'
'I don't want to die all alone'
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' ta make it last
I drink a 5th for that ass
When you pass
Cause life goes on

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz
Rest in peace young nigga

We tha last ones left
But life goes on

Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
Ya blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fair time
Won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict
That's getten' old
Plus with tha drama
We're lookin out for your babies mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in tha hood
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hoties at chill parties
Me and you
No true a two
While schemeing on hits
And gettin tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you burried
Rest nigga
Cause I ain't worried
Eyes bluried
Sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till' my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato, we're meant to rest in peace
Thug till I die

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz
Rest in peace young nigga

Rest in peace young nigga
There's a Heaven for a 'G'
Be a lie
If I told ya that I never thought of death

We tha last ones left
But life goes on

Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin

I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future 'cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door

I call the nurse 'cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walking through the cemetery talking to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace

Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga hard
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga everytime I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-Skypage, when you wanna see me
Cause I can be your man
And, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
Run the streets

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through

Now me and you was cool
But I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya
Can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
9 Times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block 'cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holler if you understand my plan, ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tounge kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker, til his hearts warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just 'cause we bone, don't mean you own me, nigga, I'm grown

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting

I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspecious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B
Fetti over something, that's tellin' me don't run the streets

So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in
'Cause I'm dressed like a thug, until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love
And let me run the streets

You can run the streets with your thugs

But nobody knew the evil he'd do 
When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze 
While puffing on a Newport
Plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas 
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me its a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv

And standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters 
If the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then that's when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game 'til its a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, 'cause shorty want to be a Thug

We gonna talk about these Skandalouz hoes

(I can talk about Skandalouz bitches)
I know you can, I know
That's why we gonna do this
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around on the piano
Nigga just drop this shit, like uh this here

I meet you through my homie
Now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed 'cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not phony, you see no love for my closest homies
With my pager number uh baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision
You had them taping hoes
No, I ain't mad at you baby
Go ahead an play them fools
They choose no to listen
So now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
My mission is to be a playa
My alias is boss
Drop the top on these jealous niggas
Playa let me floss
Y'all don't want to see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, ""Never breathing again""
It's Skandalouz
I never liked your back stabbing ass, trick
Yous tha watchin' money who you baggin' bitch
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
'Cause bitches live so Skandalouz

She so Skandalouz
She so Skandalouz
She so Skandalouz

How's it hangin'
'cause baby, from the back the shit is bangin'
I'll be stressing in this ghetto game
Trying to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass kissing
'cause bitch, I'll have you waking up
With all your cash missing, I'm askin'
As if I'm qualified, to analyze
You looking at a bitch that specialize in telling lies
She got a body that make a mutha-fucka fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through her Skandalouz eyes
Blushin' , pressuring 'n popin'
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch
So why should it bother me
I've finally been sprung
Addicted to the heat of her tongue
Although, I don't know where she going she's making me cum
I've been trained as a Boss Playa
So hoochie staying, we got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me I got up
Went into her purse and took a hundred dollars
Nigga, I'm so Skandalouz

She so Skandalouz
She so Skandalouz
She so Skandalouz

Dangerous 'n Ambitious while scheming on gettin' riches
I'm spitting at tricks, 'cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we mad it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me, Are begging for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool
Thinkin' you could be true, when I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales of my niggas doing time in tha cell
I went from hell to living well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I ain't got no time for them tricks
I'm Heavy in the Game
I want to be a balla please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin' me
I'm totein' free on the highway
Formulating plans, I can't wait till I see L.A.

Tupac Shakur,"Aight, new drink
One part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug's Passion, baby
Y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols, alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier
I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
A motherfucking fool, about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thugging, hugging plenty of G's
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me, til I'm old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying
'Cause I'mma be illing, fulfilling my passion
Til I'm burying my Thug Passion

I heard it's the bomb

You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Ooh whoa

Now what if me
Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
I'm asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me
Through that immortal flow
Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowing
And let that loc see smoke
Feeling the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Oh whoa

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm making money
Observing you motherfuckers
'Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles, a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""
See, I'm digging as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip
When I be doing this
It's so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said, so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting, bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Oh whoah

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby

Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure

I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation

Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge

Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin up on these niggas easy

My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon while beefin'
With rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself
With all these backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin wealth

Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the Glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'

But yous a money hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room all the homies do is laugh
High five's 'cause another nigga played your ass

It was said you were sleeezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need
See it's your thang and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner

But don't be bad and play the game get mad and change
Then you wonder why these muthafuckas call you names
Still lookin' for a way out and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray there's a way out

Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me 'cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom 'bout to get tossed up

Still lookin' for a rich man you dug a ditch

Got them legs wide open  while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex

I pass by can't hold back tears inside
'Cause, Lord knows for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut

It's like your mind, don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'

I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch

Straight sex and barely move your ass

Tupac Shakur,"They finally did it (what's that?) 
They stole the mic I grip 
Now that it's gone (what's wrong?) 
I'm feelin tired and sick (How did they do it?) 
I don't know I wasn't sleepin that long 
When I woke up (what happened brother?) 
My microphone was gone 
At first i panicked (how?) I put the cops on the case 
But they were stuck (damm?) Without a clue or a trace 
So sure as smokin cigarettes is bad for your health 
If I want my microphone back I'll find it myself 
So I picked up the phone (for what?) 
I called Dizzy 

What's up? 
My mic is gone 

Word? 
Let's get busy 
Before I could tell Dizzy What I wanted to do 
He was over at my house with the TMS crew 
He said 

Word is out in every mouth 
In the street now that your mic is gone 
It's not long until your beat 
And then it hit me (Damm) 
I got a battle at six 
Without my microphone I'm guaranteed to get whipped 
You might think it's unbelievable but word to the strength 
when it comes to rockin' rhymes I'm a musical nymph 
They gave me other mics but yo it wasn't no use 
I tried to rock One two one two 
But I couldn't get loose I said forget it 
My microphone or not I gotta do it 
Give it all that I go (What if you loose?) It be the first time I lost 
But if I beat em I'll finally prove I'm the boss 
I grabbed my leather jacket Walked through the streets 
Suckers was hopin' and preyin' Strictly Dope would get beat 
I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight 
Yo I was confident that I'd win 
To hell with the mic 
I hopped up to the stage Dizzy started the beat 
suckers shivered cause he Tasted defeat 
Then I signalled to Dizzy Bust a rhyme off my head 
Perpetrator fell back (Huh?) And then he was dead 
I was happy as hell Cause I was lucky that night 
Put my hand in my pocket And there was my mic

Tupac Shakur,"I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter 'cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win 'cause he's my bestfriend
But now I'm guilty, I'm fallin' for his girlfriend

I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinking into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin' 'cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel possesed by you
I have these thoughts at night of undressing you

It's kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't so he keeps on trusting me
Leaves me alone with you while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me with this temptation
Now I'm confused 'cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin' you sayin' to comeover
Now what do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher 'cause I suffer from a burnin' heart

My burnin' heart

Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel and now you wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby, did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken and now you make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love and now we are departed
Girl, I buy you anything your heart desires
I have to let you know, baby, you're my fire

Warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
This sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just being with you and seeing the two of us
Walking along the beach 'cause, girl, you are my peach
So sweet and tender my love I surrender
No need to pretend that you want it to end
I'll never let you go you're forever my girl
You know why? 'Cause girl, you are my world

My burnin' heart

Totally tongue tied every two seconds I keep watching you
He's my best friend but I can't help clockin' you
How could this be, how could we both love you?
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reenforce upon the sores that's already there
So many times my mind was locked up and we passionately stare

Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction 'cause I fiend for you desperatley
I stand here fantasicing because you're next to me
What can I do with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind and so I'm feelin' nervous

I wanna tell you how I feel but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though it drives me crazy to see you sitting with him
A tear rolls down my cheak because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're saying before they can be said
Hear the thoughts you be thinkin' before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brotha for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl

My burnin' heart, heart, heart

My heart is burnin' you know it's yearin' for your sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
You know you love me why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you yet you want somebody else
It's not that well then girl what could it be
I hope I'm good for you 'cause baby, you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then acted fool and cool and cruel like a church

Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby, you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you 'cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire

My burnin' heart

I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you

Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promised me emancipation in this new nation
All you ever gave my people was starvation
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

Coming straight that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
""Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star""
Panther power

Panther power

My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community, they killed the unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of heart disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
'Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet

Panther power

As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation indispute nation
All you gave my people was our patience

Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash

Gotta make that cash

There's no need to ask

We are still the best

As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turns..

Though I walk through the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change 
If we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' them fakes smile plastic tears
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year

From this cell to that cell, as the world turns)

It's gon' be goin round as the world turns, and steady turnin'

As the world turn burnin' paths, starin' through my rear view
It's a war goin' on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin', ""Watch em they'll kill you""
Sippin' Thug Passion, scrub actin like he feel you
Steady plottin', ready or not; Outlawz lost 
But not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlaw

Another lonely nigga with a 12-gage pump
With a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi betta unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin' we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch em wet with the tec
Hit em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
Nigga talkin' thug walkin' all through yo' squad
Y'all niggas scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got

And acquired the desired status of boss livin'

Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas, mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin' armies ridin' soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn

Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns

Ha ha, as the world turns,
And turns and turns and turns, haha,
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin' to bubble, keep on hustlin', as the world turns

Friends come and go, my soldiers, stay eternal

Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat
So when she asked me: ""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated
They chased, and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do (nah)

Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stacks more green

Who's got the heart to stand beside me?

Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud, Black Jesus

Cremated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes

And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me

Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let em play me for a buster, make it hell for a hustler

Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, being broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay struggling and juggling with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? ?, lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears, and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slipping, you soft niggas is outta here
In case you forgot, we on the same shit that got us here

Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block ducking charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missing dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell no, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dying luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slanging cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler

Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let em play me for a buster, make it hell for a hustler

No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef til I burn
Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggas shaking like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they coming for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Getting blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walking close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for busters
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler

Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let em play me for a buster, make it hell for a hustler

This is how we ride
Not knowing if we'll live or die
Catch me rolling with my motherfucking guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild til they all die

Life in High Speed
Fuck the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time

I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me
My army, niggas deceive swiftly
Look at you now, why you want to hang out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less it's without protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past, blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the D.A., be heaven sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned str8 severed then, why?
Then they wonder why niggas die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime rate, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jail house
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and tie weed
Puffin' through these High Speedz
And people say

Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a g",High Speed,1999

That's right, you ain't shit without your homeboyz

You ain't shit without your homeboyz

Now, now every time I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep

Nigga it's a goddamn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin' in the casket

How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate, go get the tape
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break

Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm LOC
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
'Cause you ain't shit without your homeboyz

We could have took it to the fifth

I would I have laid you out

When they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches
When Outlawz draw down

They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun
And never blased it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel

I ain't shit without my homeboyz
Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga

Now I was born alone
Took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated

One nigga smokin' and drinkin' and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
'Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride

To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin' since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me

Bustin' with automatic straps
My raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together

Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggas dyin' by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these niggas cross me
I'm certified crasy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, everytime I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step

Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place

It's like I'm, dreamin, see in season me ballin'

Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit

Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate, tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rollin' three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze

Whats happenin'?
I'm writin' you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin' changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected, they ain't came true

Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President (Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin on, holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies want to die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ride for M'Thulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent

Oh you'se a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crashed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a star ship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Want to ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin' with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker

Strapped and angry, with no hope and heart broke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things, squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's'll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better

How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent

Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President, hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?

I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin' for?

Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye

Tupac Shakur,"(Ha, hahaha) Hehe, word
It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
(Throw it up fool, hey nigga, haha)
Tell me how you feel homey
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crasy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentiary bound)
(Now introducin' Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin' for Precious) What?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we'll call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
To death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin' dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone

(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(Was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)

Hopin' God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man
(And his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin' a man with no feelings

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone

That's all we got left, that's all

Now with the problems of poverty
And the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
How many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
(They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know)
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out

Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' Ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg)

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Ey QB III in this motherfucker
Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades (that's right)
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day (rest in peace)
Will I, forever be alone
Yaknahmean? I know it's hard out there, hehe
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin, funerals
Will I, forever be alone
Shit, it's like I done ran out of suits homey
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do somethin y'all
We gon' have to do somethin
Will I, forever be alone
'Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing (rest in peace)
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to M'thulu Geronimo
And to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
Will I, forever be alone (to the homey Boonie, rest in peace nigga)
All the homies that fell, all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin' heart
Will I, forever be alone
In a thug niggas heart forever (that's right)
Rest in peace nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets

To my muthafuckin' eyes
I seen my brother kill his-self in my eyes
I seen Pac, yak, die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?

Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me 
I'm seeing demons
I wake up screaming
 Who believe me or was I dreaming?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes 
Til they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards

Try to get mo' so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me (You can be touched)

Schooled by the realest of the real niggas 
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb

For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here

Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat

So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'

Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it 
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it

but there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
Pen and paper in my face, I couldn't be mean
So I was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's a day in the life

Kick it, kick it, kick it

(2Pac)
Coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my cisco
Askin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' ""No""
Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slow
Dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
Roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busy
Suckers want to battle us, we move in silence
Strictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floor
And more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get up
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
The room begins to spin, I pass out for the night
Just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it

(Ray Tyson & 2Pac)
Knew I was a genius, soon as you seen this
Avoid hoe's value, don't have to redeem this
Teenage terror, no room for error
A girl start dissin', and I SCARE HER!!
Risin' like inflation on your favorite station
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls want to kiss me, suckers want to diss me
My mother didn't want me to be, but I'ma emcee
The ladies desire, emcees admire
That's why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip, girls on the ill-trip
I'm through rockin' this whack, so that's it
I am the high type, my style is so right

Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga

No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch

Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone
Bitches be warned - word is bonb, you'll get torn
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggaz wrong

I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free

Tupac Shakur,"Let knowledge drop

Why should I be forced to play dumb?
I know where I came from, so I'm goin' to claim some
But rockin' to the top where the cream of the crop
Suckers callin' the cops but they can come and get dropped

Stop, think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinkin' of when

He can back stab grab or go your hole
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Now I know the reason we must excel
'Cause if we don't, we'll end up in the cell

Move on be strong with unity
'Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo, lives must move on
And never stop open your mind
To this rhyme and let it drop

Drop that, drop that, drop that
Let knowledge drop
(Drop that, drop that, drop that)
Let knowledge drop

Yo, I'm runnin' so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink 'cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach

So listen up to the flavor I gave you, now droppin' it
We folks know ballers know no stoppin' it
Droppin' knowledge like the ay bomb, dilly as napalm
I got you scared all you got to do is stay calm

For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this
You see it and you hear it and you lovin' it

Now you buyin' this always keep your head
Look to the mountain top
Aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop
(Drop that, drop that)

(Drop that, drop that)
Let knowledge drop
(Drop that, drop that, drop that)
Let knowledge drop

Suckers suffocate when I hype this
Because you can write this
You constantly bite this
Thought that you could get me
But you sweatin' me too close
Caught with the dope dose

Now suckers get toast wonderin' who you tossed
'Cause you feelin' the full force
Like what you hearin' so your checkin' with the source
Tupac brother with the rhymes to rock on
Dizzy gets busy by puttin' beats to drop on

Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous 'cause the girls get at me
I'm not conceited, but defeated I won't be
As long as there's dope beats, I'll never be lonely stop
And let me breathe a minute
Aiyyo Dizzy what's up put the bass back in it

Let knowledge drop
Let knowledge drop

By any means necessary, it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerrilla control
I was waitin' for a prayer God gave me a goal

I refuse to be bustin', chokin', like a sucker
For I'm fightin' like a Titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I go as far as rock can see
Not mediocrity thinkin' security you got deal with me

Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops

Tupac Shakur,"I know this girl and her name is Minnie
Livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
Met her at a school dance so I took a chance
Walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance

Got to my car, put the key in the ignition
Turned on the slow jams, I was on a mission
I was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
I was J and knockin' boots right down the socks

She was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?
But when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet
I couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?
But that was my first experience with Minnie the Moocher

Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from
A dream girl to many brothers, but true to none
Her reputation was enormous, a real go getter
And once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her

Maybe it was her smile, her personality or
The way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
But whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert
Real heart-breaker, but never get hurt

She had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond
Helpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'
Met with Politicians, peace to many others
Suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers

She took the power that they possessed
And Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
Minnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
But he wanted payment for the things he did for her

He grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
Minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand
She was a legend to everyone who knew her
That's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher

Minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler
Addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker
He took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown
He bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds

She was an addict, tired of the static and poverty
Sick of the same ghetto misery
See, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
Smokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement

Then one day their relationship stopped
When Smokey was killed by the M I see Cops
Minnie was hurt, lost without a clue
To her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new

So she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems
She cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams

She had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that this girl was much needin'
A plush house made of gold and steel
A diamond car with a platt in the wheel

Now you might think this is a lot of stuff
But to Minnie this was not enough
He bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses
His meal she ate was a dozen courses

She had a fortune in nickels and dimes
And she sat around and counted it a billion times
She had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'
Had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin'

She would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
Then she dissin', with zero reply

I gotta get mine,you gotta get yours 
I gotta get mine,you gotta get yours 
I gotta get mine,you gotta get yours 
Get yours 

Smooth as a wanna be,for quickly you a gonna be 
(oh that's the way it is)
Fuck yea and that's the way its gonna be 
Why,puffin on a dank and drinking mad brew 
Taking names and after that I'm kickin' ass too. 
Breed,kinda of tha (can I get a rhyme to go) 
Hey yo Pac ill set back and design it slow. 
They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I aint takin no shorts, like a newport, 
Explortin' the fully joint and 
Explodin' on the whole court. 
And I don't wanna be,wanna be, nothin' like mike 
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin 
And when you in the spotlight,you get um jocked right 
But your life's not tight. 
Buckin' anybody forbed mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

I keep my mind on my money,money on my mind 
Finga' on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine 
Smokin' blunts a skunk, makin' hoes of punks 
And only underground funk bumpin' outta my trunk 
Live my life as a hustla, high till I die 
Meetin' bitches, gettin' riches, miss me when lie 
Picture me living out my life as a busta 
I ratha' pop out a shot out my glock, and blast muthafuckas 
I live that thug life baby I'm hopeless, chokin' off indo 
Tryin' to keep my focus 
Don't let that bullshit worry me,
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 
Till they bury me 
God gave me game so I'm hustlin', 
Pour out some liquor for my niggas 
2pac is still strugglin' 
My niggga breed new the time, 
Whether its rhyme or crime,
Nigga, I gotta get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

?
Now let me rushing threw your mind,
I'm balla is what I keep gettin' 
Every time I pick up the mic and start spittin' 
The sidewalk of new york will start bumpin' 
Jumpin' around,with the muthafuckin pound 
And I'm down to the fullest,and breakin' niggas ass off proper 
Did you right, that's right, cause I got you in my pocket again 
The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when 
I boasted,and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again. 
Like precision, cut the two lines in the division. 
Plus,what I add loose as flutes. its gaming foe sale like prostitutes. 
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt. 
They want me in the back,but bitch I'm in the front. 
Don't front,and really I don't need a reply. 
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye. 
I'm on a whole 'nother level,them hoes is left 
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself 
Goodbye,some many niggas lied to have 
Funny what a muthafucka' do for math 
I got rats caught up in my everyday actions,point 
Equal to your realist satisfaction 
Buckin' anybody that forbid mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to got mine

So when I speak hope to reach my ? mommy 
Oh come to poppy 
I love it when you sweat ? more peeps 
Until I come to wake no one can stop me 
My bump and grind 
Coming through ya every time 
Come get a blast of this through passion 
It'll blow your mind 
Hey throw up your ?
Your shit around my back 
It's a west side bang fucking hoes around the map 
? get down with Tupac while I'm ? out ? 
While they seduce my jimmy I'll 
Be screaming give me body 
Make then hoes scream my name out 
Give me my ? and don't cha ?
