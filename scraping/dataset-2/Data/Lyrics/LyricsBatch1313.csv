Bing Crosby,"There's a star for everyone
Brightly shining in the sky
It seems to be a part of our destiny
Every night I eagerly,

Watch them all go twinkling by
But I can't seem to find the one the heavens
Assigned to me...
Friendly star, where could you be hiding

Smile for me from out of the lonely night
Friendly star, my fate needs deciding
How I need the glow of your guiding light
I know that you are near, for I am strangely dreamy

And so if you can see me from afar
Won't you kindly, light my way
Lead me to my lover, Just point him out, And whisper,
""There you are, there you are""

Then my love, you will be
Standing here, close to me
In your eyes, I will see my friendly star.",Friendly Star,1994
Bing Crosby,"Pack up your troubles and just get happy 
Ya better chase all your cares away 
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy 
Get ready for the judgment day 

The sun is shining, come on get happy 
The Lord is waiting to take your hand 
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy 
We're going to the Promised Land 

We're heading 'cross the river 
Gonna wash our sins in the tide

Bing Crosby,"I got a gal that's mighty sweet
With big blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Malone
And she tips the scale at twenty stone.

Oh, gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug her, you don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a ways and chalk a mark to see where you began

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-chalkin' and a-huggin' away
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way over the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Oh Gee, it aint so grand to be a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug me you don't know where you're at

I have to take a piece of chalk in my hand
And hug away and chalk a mark to see where I began

Now where is that chalk? Ah, here it is
I'll put one cross here, and another one here.

Darling.

Ah, but seriously you know that I'm crazy about you, 
And I mean all of you, every little bit.

We both feel we're meant for each other.

Yet when we walk through the street people think 
That I'm out with my mother.

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other side, It was Lou Praeger
Comin' around the other side.",Huggin' and Chalkin',1994
Bing Crosby,"They say I'm crazy 
Got no sense 
But I don't care 
They may or may not mean offense 
But I don't care 
You see, I'm sort of independent 
I am my own superintendent 
And my star is on the ascendant 
That's why I don't care 

I don't care, I don't care 
What they may think of me 
I'm happy-go-lucky, they say that I'm plucky 
Contented and carefree 
I don't care I don't care 
If I do get a mean and stony stare 
If I'm not successful 
It won't be distressful 
Cause I don't care 

A girl should know her etiquette 
Alas, alack 
Propriety demands we walk a narrow track 
When fellas used to blink at me 
I'd freeze 'em and they'd shrink at me 
But now when fellas wink at me 
I wink at them right back! 

I don't care I don't care 
If people frown on me 
Perhaps it's the lone way 
But I go my own way 
That's my philosophy 
I don't care I don't care 
If he's clerk or just a millionaire 
There's no doubt about it, 
I'll sing and I'll shout it 
Cause I don't care 

Oh, I don't care, I don't care 
When it comes to happiness, 
I want my share 
Don't try to rearrange me 
There's nothing can change me 
'cause I don't care!",I Don't Care,1994
Bing Crosby,"I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin",I've Got You Under My Skin,1994
Bing Crosby,"Liza, Liza, skies are gray
But if you smile at me, all the clouds will roll away
Liza, Liza, don't delay
Come keep me company, and the clouds will roll away

See the honey moon is shining down
We should make a date with Parson Brown
So Liza, Liza, name the day
When you belong to me, and the clouds will roll away

See the honey moon is shining down
We should make a date with Parson Brown
Liza, Liza, won't you name the day
When you belong to me, and the clouds will roll away
Liza",Liza (All the Clouds'll Roll Away),1994
Bing Crosby,"Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
I love somebody but I won't say who

Handsome, say, he's six feet tall
And his picture's on my wall
Love to be his baby doll
If he kissed me I [Buddy joins in] wouldn't mind at all

I love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody but I won't say who

Don't know why she acts so shy,
She oughta know I wouldn't dream
Of even hurtin' a fly
Hope she doesn't pass me by
'cause if she did I'd die, I know I'd die

I love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody but I won't say who

He's big and strong
Would'ja like to feel my muscle?
Bold and gay
I never once lost a tussle
At the moment he's not very far away
Why don'tcha say who, say already?
I'd want to marry him today
But you don't say who
That I cannot do
Happen to be me?
Possibility
Won'tcha tell me who ya love?
Love somebody
Tell me true
Yes, I do
Yes, you do
Love somebody
I do, too
And I do
Maybe me
Love somebody
I hope it's me

Love somebody but I won't say who
(At this point Doris sang, ""say and Buddy sang tell"".

C'mon confess
Why don'tcha try and guess?
Do tell. 
Let's tell.
You promise not to breathe a word?
Doris, don't be absurd
Strictly entre-nous?
Oui, oui!! We two

Well
Confidentially
Between you and me
Confidentially
I love somebody
I've got news for you
Love somebody
I feel that way, too
Love somebody
Glad it's true
That somebody that I love is you",Love Somebody,1994
Bing Crosby,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 

",Ma (He's Making Eyes at Me),1994
Bing Crosby,"Maybe it's because I love you too much
Maybe that is why you love me so little

Maybe when I answered, yes
Maybe I became a bore
Maybe if I loved you less
Maybe you would love me more

Maybe it's because I've kissed you too much
Maybe that is why my kiss means so little

Maybe with a love so great and a love so small
Maybe I'll be left with no love at all",Maybe It's Because,1994
Bing Crosby,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only `cos you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Bing Crosby,"You ask me why I'm always teasing you, 
You hate to have me call you Pretty Baby, 
I really thought that I was pleasing you, 
For you're just a baby to me. 
Your cunning little dimples and your baby stare, 
Your baby talk and baby walk and curly hair, 
Your baby smile makes life worth while, 
You're just as sweet as you can be.

Your mother says you were the cutest kid, 
No wonder, dearie, that I'm wild about you, 
And all the cunning things you said and did. 
Why, I love to fondly recall, 
Ann just like Peter Pan, it seems you'll always be 
The same sweet, cunning, Little Baby dear to me. 
And that is why I'm sure that I will always love you best of all.

Everybody loves a baby that's why I'm in love with you, 
Pretty Baby, Pretty Baby, 
And I'd to be your sister, brother, dad and mother too, 
Pretty Baby, Pretty Baby. 
Won't you come and let me rock you in my cradle of love, 
And we'll cuddle all the time. 
Oh! I want a Lovin' Baby and it might as well be you, 
Pretty Baby of mine.",Pretty Baby,1994

Why you ramble,
No one knows

Ramble on,
When you're rambling
Days are gone?

Bing Crosby,"[Chorus]
Who, stole my heart away 
Who, makes me dream all day 
Dreams I know can never come true 
Seems as though I'll ever be blue 
Who, means my happiness 
Who, would I answer yes to 
No one, but you! 

A woman's intentions, her famine inventions 
A seldom if ever defined 
And I am no different, why should I be different? 
I simply can't make up my mind 
How can I solve this situation 
Except by the process of elimination

Can it be, can it be, who can it be? 
You'll never guess who has stolen my heart away Dreamin' dreams I know 
Can never come true

Bing Crosby,"When you see land 
(Out of the window of a train)
Kinda green and grassy,
(How in the world can you complain?)
Beneath a moon

Bright beyond compare,

When you hear blue jays chirping high and sassy,
And catch one sniff of southern cooking 
Hanging on the evening air

When you see folks
(Having their after dinner chats)
All polite and classy 
(Gentlemen all remove their hats)
And every smile

Bids you stay and rest,

Words and music by Irving Berlin
-From the musical ""Holiday Inn""
Sweetheart of mine, I've sent you a valentine.
Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine.
Be careful, it's my heart.
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.
Remember it's my heart.
The heart with which so willingly I part.
It's yours to take to keep or break,
But please, before you start,
Be careful, it's my heart.

Far away over the sea

At least they flap their fins to express emotion

You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France! (Fronce)
I haven't got a chonce (chance), this is a fine romance

Bing Crosby,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland
Then maybe at the closing of your day
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadows making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay

For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' prates
Speak a language that the strangers do not know

For the strangers came and tried to teach us their way
They scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star

And if there is going to be a life hereafter
And faith I am sure there's going to be
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish sea",Galway Bay,1994

Speak once again of my love, my own

you took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere

You to make each dream of mine come true

Things just happened and so did you

And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

And singin' fills the air
In the shank of the night
When the doin's are right

Well you can tell em I'll be there
I like a barbecue
I like to boil a ham
And I vote for bola baste stew

What's that?
I like a weenie bake, steak and a layer cake
And you'll get a tummy ache too
We'll rent a tent or a teepee

Let the town crier cry
""All's well!""
And if it's RSVP
This is what I'll reply

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em we'll be there
If you need a pair of freeloaders
To fracture your affair

I may even give them Pagliacci
Now stand back and give him air
If one can relax and we'll have a few yaks
And you can tell them we'll be there

""Oui,"" said the bumblebee
""Let's have jubilee.""
""When?"" said the prairie hen, ""Soon?""
""Sure,"" said the dinosaur

""Where?"" said the grisly bear
""Under the light of the moon.""
""How about your brother, jackass?""
Everyone gaily cried

""Are you coming to the fracas?""
Ain't gonna blow it
""And all the respects,"" he sighed
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening

Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Stick 'em on my hair
If perchance we look a bit peeked

Remember se la guerre
If we're still on our feet
And there's something to eat
Well you can tell them we'll be there

Tell 'em I'll be there

And my laundry is back

If there's room for one more

If you need a new face or a tenor or base

If I can climb out of bed and put a head on my head
Well you can tell 'em we'll be there.","In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening",1994

Just by the turn of a phrase?
Can I keep my control

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Each sweetheart has heard with a sigh,
Over high garden walls, this sweet echo falls,

Hello means the birth of a smile.
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace,
When we meet in the after a while:

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu,
When the clouds roll by, I'll come to you,
Then the skies will seem more blue

So wait and pray each night for me

To tell everybody the whole tale about the 'Island',
Flint's treasure and Mr. Silver.
Keeping nothing back but its position and that only,
Because the major part of the treasure has not been lifted yet.
I personally think we would never have begun this adventure
And set course with the 'Hispaniola', if we had known
What would happen and that some of us would never return,
Having lost their lives. Sometimes the whole story haunts dreams
And brings me the worst nightmares I ever had.
That's when I hear the cries of the fallen,
The waves pounding the rocks on the coast and Captain Flint's
Raw voice screaming: 'Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Ha ha hah!'.
And I tell you, no oxen and wain ropes will ever take me
Back to Treasure Island!

To free it from 'Hand's' grip

'Silver's' villains quit
Abandonment, to 'Silver's' hand
A cunning pack is made
Trick or treat, make scoundrels
Bleed, their dullness will be paid

I stumble to the stockade
The sweat drips form my brow
No one keeps a lockout, oh no!
The rabble owns it now
'Silver' tries to shield me
The 'Black spot' comes again
He throws the map onto the ground
He plays a tricky game

The dead-man marks the way
No chest, no gold, no silver
2 guineas is their pay
Musket cracks like thunder
The blood is running red

High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

Daughter hadn't oughter 
Least until she could run like the dickens

Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!

A kiss and now and then a sigh
 
For a man and his dream
And their eyes when they meet
Seem to say it's sublime
And their hearts proudly beat
 
To a tune that is older than time
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love
So all the world will say
There's a man and his dream
 
And their eyes when they meet
Seem to say it's sublime
And their hearts proudly beat
 
To a tune that is older than time
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love

When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",Hark! The Herald Angels Sing/It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1995

You're getting rusty, so you say, 
You feeling bad, and everything looks gray, and say, 
You're getting worried, yes indeed, 
I know exactly what you need: 
A little sunshine will make you feel okay! 
Now lookie here: 
Give the blues a chase, 
Find a sunny place, 
Go and change your face 
With sunshine! 
With sunshine! 
Pay your doctor bills, 
Throw away his pills, 
You can cure your ills 
With sunshine! 
Why don't you take your tear drops one by one, 
Before it gets too late, 
Hang them up out in the sun, 
And they'll evaporate!

Trouble will depart

And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine

Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise

Bing Crosby,"You came a long way from St. Louis, you climbed the ladder of success,
I've seen the town and country cars that were parked out in front of your fancy address.
You came a long way from St. Louis, you broke a lotta hearts between,
I've seen a gang of gloomy gals who were doing alright till you came on the scene.
You came here from the middle west, and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.
Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.
So natcherly I got my doubts, you got `em dropping by the wayside,
A feeling I ain't gonna know.
You came a long way from St. Louis, but baby, you still got a long way to go.

There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral
Seems there is someone at my side

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal

Bing Crosby,"There's a tear in your eye
And I'm wondering why
For it never should be there at all
With such pow'r in your smile
Sure a stone you'd beguile
So there's never a teardrop should fall

When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You should laugh all the while
And all other times smile
And now, smile a smile for me

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright
Like the linnet's sweet song
Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light

For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get

Bing Crosby,"Oh the Murphy's gave a party just about a week ago
Everything was plentiful, the Murphy's they're not slow
They treated us like gentlemen, we tried to act the same
But only for what happened, well it was an awful shame

When Mrs. Murphy dished the chowder out
She fainted on the spot
She found a pair of overalls
In the bottom of the pot
Tim Nolan he got rippin' mad
His eyes were bulgin' out
He jumped up on the PI-A-NO
And loudly he did shout

Oh, who threw the overalls in Mrs Murphy's chowder
Nobody spoke, so he shouted all the louder
It's an Irish trick that's true
I can lick the mick that threw
The overalls in Mrs Murphy's chowder

So we dragged the pants from out the soup and laid them on the floor
Each man swore upon his breast he'd ne'er seen them before
They were plastered up with mortar and were worn out at the knee
They'd had their many ups and downs as we could plainly see

when Mrs Murphy she came to she began to cry and pout
She'd had them in the wash that day and forgot to take them out
Tim Nolan he excused himself for what he'd said that night
So we put music to the words and sang with all our might

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go

Bing Crosby,"What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum,
Come to the cabaret.

Put down the knitting, the book, and the broom.
Time for a holiday.
Life is a cabaret, old chum,
Come to the cabaret.

Come taste the wine,
Come hear the band,
Come blow your horn,
Start celebrating,
Right this way,
Your table's waiting.

No use permitting
Some prophet of doom to wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum,
So come to the cabaret!

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie,
With whom I shared four sorbid rooms in Chelsea.
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower.

As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.
The day she died the neighbors came to snicker
""Well, that's what comes from
Too much pills and liquor.""

But when I saw her laid out like a queen,
She was the happiest, corpse,
I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say,
""What good is sitting alone in your room?

Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum,
Come to the cabaret.

And as for me,
As for me
I made my mind up, back in Chelsea,

Bing Crosby,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time rewritten every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we? Could we?

What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were

Bing Crosby,"The streets were dark and the night was cold and yet I walk alone
I saw the lights of a cozy place with lanterns all aglow
Somebody cried, ""Don't wait outside, come say, hello""

The people there, they were singing songs I knew when I was young
And from the jukebox I heard the sounds, I needed to recall
I sang along with every song, I knew them all

Everyone's your brother, we're a long way from home
And we need each other, have no fear, you're welcome here

We can understand that you're a long way from home
But we have each other, have no fear, you'll like it here

It's not so easy to feel at home when home's so far away
When all the longing and all the wanting is for yesterday
You've made me find some peace of mind I'd like to stay

The world seems colder when you're a stranger from a foreign land
You need to feel that someone cares and that they understand
Many a tear would disappear if we joined hands

Grows dark and full of clouds

And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

Bing Crosby,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean,

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember,
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1997

Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

Weep no more, my lady,
Oh weep no more today!
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,
For the old Kentucky home far away. 

They hunt no more for the 'possum and the coon,
On meadow, the hill and the shore,
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,
On the bench by that old cabin door;
The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,
With sorrow where all was delight;
The time has come when the people have to part,
Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

The head must bow and the back will have to bend,
Wherever the people may go;
A few more days and the trouble all will end
In the field where sugar-canes may grow;
A few more days for to tote the weary load,
No matter, 'twill never be light,
A few more days till we totter on the road,
Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

Where do they woo on a rainy night in Rio?
How can a guy meet a sweetheart by the sea?
Maybe the girl wants a tender kiss, and yet,
How tender can you get
When you're beneath a wet palm tree?

Whadda they do in Mississippi
When skies are drippy?

In Alberquerque?
And whadda they do in Old Arkoona
When the moon above ain't bright?

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.
That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.",Memphis Blues,1997

And you must pay before you get them back again.

That's what storms were made for
And you shouldn't be afraid for:

Every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town

Aren't you glad you've got a nose?

Aren't you glad you're you?

Aren't you glad you've got two ears?
And if your heart is singing, too,
Aren't you glad you're you?
You can see a summer sky,
Or touch a friendly hand,
Or taste an apple pie.

When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armored knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;

Bing Crosby,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game

And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

What a joy for a boy to behold
In each house you'll find a sleigh

Sends the snowflakes up in flurries

Folks put runners on their surreys
They forget about their worries
And a man becomes a boy once again

Boy, how they could love!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel,
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop,
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!

Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou knowst it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?

Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.

Forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,1999

Bing Crosby,"When the work begins to pile up,
And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Tune up and start
To whistle while you work.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Lay keeping their sheep

Hand us that pretty crate
5 degrees to the right'll make it

Just as sure as fate
The ship belonged to the bombardier
Who opened his little bag
He saw the target and locked the target
And suddenly (bombs away)
Said the bombardier to the pilot

Call it a day, and then
The pilot said to the radioman
Say we done it again
The weather's fine for flying
The fog has gone to bed
There's such good visibility
You can see victory ahead
Let's fill the air with Eagles
Let's fill the clouds with men
And we shall see a world that's free

When we fly home again
Let's fill the air with Eagles

Bing Crosby,"Oh, oh, many years ago
Lived the wife of happy Rip Van Winkle
Oh, oh, she sent him away
As the little stars began to twinkle
All that he had he had under his hat
She was glad to see him go
So over the hills he went
Left her without a cent
One thing I'm anxious to know

Who paid the rent for Mrs. Rip Van Winkle
When Rip Van Winkle went away?
And though he slept for twenty years
Who was it kissed away her tears?

She had no friends in the place
No one to embrace
But the landlord always left her with a smile on his face

When Rip Van Winkle went away?

C'mon, tell me!

Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed;

Flit away with a smile and a tear.
So you never can tell who is kissing her how.
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

First you come and bring happiness into my heart
Then, you funny thing, you go and tear it right apart

My life was just a heavenly load
Someone made it seem that way
Then for no reason she let me go
Do you call that fair play?
I'm just wondering what the end is gonna be
Love, you funny thing, won't you bring her back to me.","Love, You Funny Thing",2000
Bing Crosby,"Though you haven't many toys
You don't envy any boys
Every day's a work day,
Your work is just a game
I'd like to sing your praise
but I don't know your name

You're just a shoe shine boy
You work hard all day
Shoe shine boy
Got no time to play
Every nickel helps a lot
So shine, shine, shoe shine boy.

You find joy in the things you do
Shoe shine boy seldom ever blue
You're content with what you've got
So shine, shine, shoe shine boy.

People look at you with scorn
'cos your clothes are worn and torn
Still you never whine
You keep looking up and down the street
Pleading with each one you meet
Brother can you spare a shine.

Oh, Shoe shine boy soon the day will come
Shoe shine boy soon a tune you'll hum
Every nickel helps a lot
So shine, shine, shoe shine boy.

Shoe shine, shoe shine boy",Shoe Shine Boy,2000
Bing Crosby,"When you dream about Hawaii
Don't forget to dream about that night we met
When you feel my arms around you
Will memory cling, echoing, I won't forget

When you hear the rippling water
As they kissed the silvery sand, so playfully
Will you hear me say 'I love you'
To the tune of steel guitars beneath the stars at Waikiki
When you dream about Hawaii, dream of me

When you hear the rippling water
As they kissed the silvery sand, so playfully
Will you hear me say 'I love you'
To the tune of steel guitars beneath the stars at Waikiki
When you dream about Hawaii, dream of me",When You Dream About Hawaii [Take B],2000
Bing Crosby,"He made the night a little brighter
Wherever he would go
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago
His snowy hair was so much whiter
Beneath the candle glow
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago

You'd hear the patter of his feet
As he came toddling down the street
His smile would cheer a lonely heart you see
If there were sweethearts in the park
He'd pass a lamp and leave it dark
Remembering the days that used to be
For he recalled when things were new
He loved someone who loved him too
Who walks with him alone in memories

He made the night a little brighter
Wherever he would go
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago
His snowy hair was so much whiter
Beneath the candle glow
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago

Now if you look up in the sky
You'll understand the reason why
The little stars at night are all aglow
He turns them on when night is near
He turns them off when dawn is here
The little man we left so long ago
He made the night a little brighter
Wherever he would go
The old lamplighter of long, long ago",The Old Lamplighter,2000
Bing Crosby,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away in a Manger,2000

Was I having fun
Until one night she caught me right
And now I'm on the run

And I'll woo you every day

And she hit me over the head

We're three tough gals
From deep down Texas way
We got no pals

We're a rough rooting tooting shooting trio

But there ain't no nicer terror
Here's what we tell her

The revenuers came
The drought was slow
So now they know
You can't do that to Mame

Bing Crosby,"In the shadows, let me come and sing to you
Let me dream a song that I can bring to you
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you
Let me linger long
Let me live my song

In the winter, let me bring the spring to you
Let me feel that I mean everything to you
Love's old song will be new
In the shadows when I come and sing to you

Shadows on the wall
I can see them fall
Here and there
Everywhere
Silhouettes in blue
Dancing in the dew
Here am I
Where are you?

In the winter, let me bring the spring to you
Let me feel that I mean everything to you
Love's old song will be new
In the shadows when I come and sing to you, dear
In the shadows when I come and sing to you",Shadow Waltz,2001
Bing Crosby,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit before the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things,2001

To start their celebrating
When you say ""I do""

Bing Crosby,"Most people live on a lonely island
Lost in the middle of a foggy sea

Come to me, come to me""

Bing Crosby,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven

Bing Crosby,"When I pretend I'm gay
I never feel that way
I'm only painting the clouds with sunshine
When I hold back a tear
To make a smile appear
I'm only painting the clouds with sunshine

Painting the blue, beautiful hues,
Colored with gold and old rose
Playing the clown,
Trying to drown all of my woes
Though things may not look bright
They all turn out alright
If I keep painting the clouds with sunshine.",Painting the Clouds With Sunshine,2001
