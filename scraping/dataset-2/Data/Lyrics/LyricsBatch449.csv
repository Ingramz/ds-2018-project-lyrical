Andy Taylor,"When you close your eyes
I feel like I'm in heaven
When you're in my arms
I never want to leave you
No matter where you're going

What can I do that's not wrong
When will my world turn around

Stand by me
I'll never let you go
Hold me close
I love you so
Is it just my heart
Lyin' to my head
Stand by me

When you close your eyes
I feel like I'm in heaven

What can I say that's not wrong
When will our worlds turn around",Thunder,1987
Andy Taylor,"You're the one
The only one
And I try not to break you

You're the one
The only one
And I just can't seem to shake you

Why do I feel bad
Why do I feel sad
What I'm trying to say 
I'm tremblin'
Though I can't explain
That I'm goin' insane
I need you so 
I'm tremblin'

This time
This is the last time
I just can't live on without you
How long
Tell me how long
'Cause I always think about you",Tremblin',1987
Andy Taylor,"Oh, she looked good
It was just like a dream
I knew I wouldn't sleep tonight
And her eyes shot right through me
Had me holding on for my life

She knew the magic word
She didn't waste no time
She had my number dialed
Like she could read my mind

She was dead on the money
She was perfect for me
She was dead on the money
She was everything I wanted a love to be
Everything I wanted love to be

So we talked
And then she took me home
I was smoking like a cigarette
She asked for one more kiss
And then I knew
I hadn't seen nothing yet

Like every time before
It was a shot in the dark
But when she took the reins
Yeah, she was right on the mark",Dead on the Money,1988
Andy Taylor,"If you want to hang out you've gotta take her out: Cocaine
If you want to get down, down on the ground: Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If you got that loose, you want to kick them blues: Cocaine
When your turn is done and you want to ride on: Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If you figure it's gone and you want to ride on: Cocaine
Don't forget this fact you can't get it back: Cocaine

Ride on
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine",Cocaine,1990
Andy Taylor,"Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you I'm in love with you

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
It just might be some other silly pretty girl
That I sing it to

Don't believe a word
For words are easily spoken
And your heart is like a promise
There to be broken

Don't believe a word
'Cause words can tell lies
And lies only comfort
When there's tears in your eyes

Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you I'm in love with you

Don't believe a word",Don't Believe a Word,1990
Andy Taylor,"Well, if you're looking for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're looking for satisfaction
The satisfaction's guaranteed

I'm as cool as a body on ice
Hotter than the rollin' dice
Take you to heaven, take you to hell
I ain't foolin' 
Can't you tell

I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire

Gotta set this town on fire
Well, if you need some lovin'
If you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I've got no future plans

Oh, come on honey
You've got nothing to lose
You've got the thirst and I've got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I'm gonna make you fry

Holy smoke and sweet desire
Cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than the rollin' dice
I'm gonna make you fry
You're gonna burn tonight

Gonna set this town on fire",Live Wire,1990
Andy Taylor,"Mustang Sally
Guess you better slow your Mustang down
Mustang Sally, baby
I guess you better slow your Mustang down
You been runnin' all over town
Guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground

All you want to do is ride around Sally (Ride Sally Ride)
All you want to do is ride around Sally (Ride Sally Ride)
All you want to do is ride around Sally (Ride Sally Ride)
All you want to do is ride around Sally (Ride Sally Ride)
One of these early mornings
I'm gonna be wipin' your weepin' eyes

I bought you a brand new Mustang
By Nineteen-Sixty-Five
Now you comin' right signifying woman
You don't want to let me ride
Mustang Sally
Guess you better slow your Mustang down",Mustang Sally,1990
Andy Taylor,"Never get to bed before sunup
Always getting caught in the rain
Sometimes I might get in trouble
Never was I one to complain
Forget about your vast degrees, yeah
Ain't it worth it when you're out on cloud thirty-three

Stone cold sober again
Down in the alley again
Stone cold sober again

Never found a dime in the gutter
Always get my best friends drunk
If the pres'dent tries to call on me
Say ""Andy, come on over for lunch""
I'd say, ""Gentleman, excuse me please
But I'm busy with my buddies up on cloud thirty-three""

Sunday is a drag so forget it
Monday you can make up for that
Tuesday take a taste for dinner
If you'd only spend it in bed
But on Thursday night prepare for the weekend
And let Friday disappear into Saturday morning",Stone Cold Sober,1990
Andy Taylor,"Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for long long years
Stolen many a man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ had His moment of doubt and pain
I made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all it was you and me
Let me please introduce my self
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I lay traps for troubadors
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all sinners, Saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me have some courtesy
Have some sympathy
Have some taste
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Please to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game",Sympathy for the Devil,1990
Andy Taylor,"I'm a missing link
Poolroom stink
I can't talk

(That's too bad)
What's goin' on?
Something's wrong
I can't work

Can't go to school
The teacher's a fool
The preacher's a jerk

(That's such a drag)
Got nothing to do
Street-corner blues
And nowhere to walk

Violence, violence
It's the only thing that'll make you see sense
Violence, violence
It's the only thing that'll make you see sense

Got in a fight
Nothing's right
Livin' nowhere

(That's so sad)
Watch out for the gun
Snake on the run
Hide in my hair

You keep your mouth shut
Or you'll get cut
And I like to scare

(Bet you're so mad)
I'm a battery louse
A superstar mouse
I don't care

Get off my back
Or I'll attack
'Cause I don't owe you nothing

Head for your hole
You're sick and you're old
And I'm here to tell you something",Violence,1990
Andy Taylor,"The door is opening there's a glimmer of light
Keep on pushing it will give tonight
And I don't care if it takes me long
It really doesn't matter if its right or wrong

The fires are burning and its warm inside my soul
As we wander down the road
The gift is mine tonight

Don't care if the mood won't last
And I don't care if it goes slow or fast
The stage is set, the timing's right
Let me lead you to the light
A chance is all there's ever gonna be
It's here let's take a hold
The gift is mine tonight - tonight

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

I've thought of how it could be in the future everyday
I've thought of all the good things in the past
Everyday, every night.
I shouted at the sky but the sky was deaf
I looked into the ashes but the heat had all left
I never dreamed that it could be this way again

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

And I don't care if the cost is great
Stop and think about it, it's too late
The sails are set, the tide has turned
Time to go explore the world
The winds are blowing but its warm inside my soul
As we turn and leave the shore
The gift is mine tonight

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.",The Gift,1991
Andy Taylor,"I met her in a club down in North Soho
Where you drink champagne, tastes just like cherry cola
See-O-L-A cola

She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her name and in a dark brown voice she said, ""Lola""
L-O-L-A Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, la la la la Lola

I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola, la la la la Lola, la la la la Lola

Yeah, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knees
Said, ""Little boy, won't you come home with me""

I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes
I almost fell for my Lola
La la la la Lola, la la la la Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
I looked at her and she at me

That's the way I want it to stay
I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La la la la Lola

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola, la la la la Lola

Well, I left home just a week before
I never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
Said, ""Little boy I'm gonna make you a man""

I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am
I'm glad I';m a man
So is Lola
La la la la Lola, la la la la Lola",Lola,1998
Andy Taylor,"In the morning
Don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door

I know your name is Rita
'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor
guitar

Won't need to much persuading
I don't mean to sound degrading
But with a face like that
You got nothing to laugh about

Red lips hair and fingernails
I hear your a mean old Jezebel
Lets go up stairs and read my tarot cards

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me

So in the morning
Please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door

Yea I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight you better stay with me
Sit down, get up, get down

Stay with me
Stay with me

Oh no, get down",Stay with Me,1999

Andy Timmons,"One day you have it all, 
The next you've thrown it all away.
And you cry all night, 
Wondering how you let it go.
And it's so like sand through your fingertips.
Ain't it funny how it slips away.

You and your lonely life, 
Believing it'll all work out.
And you know you're right, still the memory lingers on.
Don't you know that I would go to pieces yeah, 
Ain't it funny how it slips away.

Ain't it funny how it slips, funny how it slips away

I've heard that nothing lasts forever now, 
I know, I know,

Never let it slip away

And it's so like sand through your fingertips.

Andy Timmons Band,"For the benefit of Mr. Kite 
There will be a show tonight on trampoline 
The Hendersons will all be there 
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene 
Over men and horses hoops and garters 
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world! 

The celebrated Mr. K. 
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate 
The Hendersons will dance and sing 
As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late

Their production will be second to none 
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound 
And Mr. H. will demonstrate

And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill",Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,2011
Andy Timmons Band,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life,2011
Andy Timmons Band,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door 
I'm taking the time for a number of things 
That weren't important yesterday 
And I still go 

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go",Fixing a Hole,2011
Andy Timmons Band,"It's getting better all the time 
I used to get mad at my school 
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool 
You're holding me down 
Filling me up with your rules 

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine 

Me used to be angry young man 
Me hiding me head in the sand 
You gave me the word

I'm doing the best that I can

I used to be cruel to my woman 
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved

Andy Timmons Band,"Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. 

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, 
Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita,2011
Andy Timmons Band,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,2011
Andy Tongren,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,2007
Andy Tongren,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2007
Andy Tongren,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Sometimes I feel like my only friend

Andy Williams,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still

Andy Williams,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Your Song,1971
Andy Williams,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

I recall the yellow cotton dress
It was foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Checkers by the trees

MacArthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain
And I don't think that I can take it
Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no, oh no

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Oh, someone will bring it

I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one
Little girl

I will take my life into my hands, I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes oh and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky

And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

MacArthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain

In days that are no more.
I used to love to run with her
Along the sandy shore.
She had a special prayer for me
To help my world go right.

The coldest winter night.

I hear the music from across the way,
Across the bridges of my mind.
I lift the misty shades of yesterday
To catch the dreams I left behind.

It was a joy to be with her,
To watch the way she smiled.
I guess I just felt free with her,
So free and young and wild.
I really came to love that girl;
How much she'll never know.
I need the nearness of that girl;
I really miss her so.

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king

The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing



Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl

And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing

And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing



O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low

Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow

Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing

O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing



For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old

When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold

When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King

And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing

Has always been the most destructive kind
I guess that's why now 
I feel so old
Before my time

Yesterday, when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play

There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for

Let me say goodbye

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me

With her first hello

There'd never be another love, another time

She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely

I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away

Laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door

Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

More than the simplest words I try to say

My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
Longer than always is long, long time,

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

Wondering in the night
What were the chances wed be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in you smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night

Some children see him lily white,
The baby jesus born this night,
Some children see him lily white,
With tresses soft and fair.

Some children see him bronzed and brown,
The lord of heav'n to earth come down;
Some children see him bronzed and brown,
With dark and heavy hair.

Some children see him almond-eyed,
This savior whom we kneel beside,
Some children see him almond-eyed,
With skin of yellow hue.

Some children see him dark as they,
Sweet mary's son to whom we pray,
Some children see him dark as they,
And, ah! they love him, too!

The children in each diff'rent place
Will see the baby jesus' face
Like theirs, but bright with heav'nly grace,
And filled with holy light.

And with thy heart as offering,
Come worship now the infant king.

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

To tell the story of how great a love can be 
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me? 
Where do I start? 

With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There’d never be another love, another time 
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angel songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I’m never lonely
With her along, who could be lonely? 
I reach for her hand, it’s always there

How long does it last? 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?

Away from all the earthly cares around us 
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it 
And all at once the happiness I knew, 
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed,
The splendid things I planned
I always built, alas,
On weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see,

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me
And nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue,
And every crazy day brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand,
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday

Emerald birds glide through a rainbow as they fly
Bringing beauty Holly enters my mind

Where the crystal ocean finds the shore
Diamond waves reflect the love we shared before
Through the silence Holly enters my mind

All alone as I walk by the sea
Thoughts of Holly are my company
For she calls to me with each shining ray
With each season's change
With the sun and the sea and the sky she remains

Though the world must take her far away
On a velvet wind she comes to me each day
When I'm lonely Holly enters my mind

Does enchantment pour out of every door?

You tried to teach me right from wrong

Too much wine and too much song

Wonder how I got along.

When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring.

[Chorus]

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say,

Andy Williams,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,2002

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the nickels and the dimes of your days

Who never gave up hope
All breathe a sigh together
As they reach to catch the rope

But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name

And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

Yes, see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big

The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed,
The splendid things I planned
I always built, alas,
On weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see,

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me
And nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue,
And every crazy day brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand,
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday

But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Sweet thoughts and dreams,
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend,
Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.
 
It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else.
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away,
I have to hide behind myself.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied.
Only you can set me free
See what's on the other side of me.

",The Other Side of Me,2002
Andy Williams,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
And slowly died within his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes me, takes me down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
I'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
I'm playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
The eyes are closed, the heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by myself it's easy to pretend
You're coming back again

And keeping to myself I plays the game
Without your love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

If I'm laden at all,
I I am laden with sadness that
Everyone's heart isn't filled with the gladness
I am alone for one and other

For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me

And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

I will win the worship in their eyes oh and I will lose it

I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what it's all about

You don't have to suffer
Relax into your new life

Of utter contentment
Gets too much

The useless strangers
Sharing my time and space
They might hear my humming
My tapping of fingers anyway
At least I have my thoughts all to myself
My content and the view outside

I see a rainbow complete
Resting its feet on the hill and the ground
Works as an illustration to the sound
This is a whole in time

A couple of hours when the day is
More abstract than usually
I star in this movie
I play the part and unify

With the soundtrack in my head

I could be anywhere

Which fills my head",Headphone Silence,2003

And the ground and dirt you walk on

And tell lies you never knew weren't true

Unfolding the first morning light
He glances at his disenchanted life

Restlessness is me, you see (you see)
It's hard to be safe
It's difficult to be happy

It's the changing of the seasons

The clearness of fall

Want only whats good for you

Ane Brun,"I wish I had one last try
Hidden somewhere inside
But it's all been spend before

When I reach for it I can sense it in my hand
And when I try to grasp it
It's like sand, or water
Through my hopeful fingers

This just won't hold, hold
This just won't hold, hold

There's something so half-full about us
We get so little but what we get it tastes so much
We're always longing for more

Is this the end of the thread?
The thread that led me to lose my head
Over something that started with wonder

This just won't hold, hold, hold, hold

And even if a butterfly lives a hundred years
Or the stream of water turns around in the rivers

You were old love
Like we've never been parted

About how long
There's hunger for one more time

Oh love, you covered my skin
With your eyes as they found me
I kissed you, danced in your sand
And fell into a never ending moment
And the whisper from your mouth through mine
With those words that gently filled my lungs
Lover of mine, when I'm with you
I forget how am I to being lonely
Living without you
Spend another day passing by you
Don't wanna know how it feels if I do

Of the headphone silence

Cuts me off
From the rest of the world

Sharing my time and space
They might hear my humming
My tapping of fingers anyway
At least I have my thoughts all to myself
My content and the view outside

I see a rainbow complete
Resting its feet on the hill and the ground
Works as an illustration to the sound
This is a whole in time

More abstract than usually

I play the part and unify

Inside lie bitter pills

Fly - through the blazing cosmic eye

Seven ways to shine

One that's closed behind

But I never thought you'd go
No, I never thought you'd walk away

And angel's a long time gone

With logic reason
How can I tell the black from white
If all is black and blue?
God knows where I'm going
When the keeper waves me through...

Enveloppée dans sa carapace.

A vendre sa cuirasse.

Pleurait dans mon mouchoir,
Pendant qu'une imbécile
Récurait son couloir,
Son couloir de batailles,
Rayé de zèbres fourbes,
Quadrillant la mitraille
En épousant la courbe.
J'ai vu le président
Cracher dans un calice !
J'ai vu le président
Se soigner les varices...
J'ai vu son firmament
Se dépuceler d'étoiles...
J'ai vu mes trente-deux dents
Se transformer en poils !

""Au Cul !"" me dit l'évêque !

Il faut clouer ton bec !

Je fermerais ma gueule...
Je prendrais l'aller simple ;

Et puis vous êtes contents,
Et puis ils sont contents,
Alors je suis content
Que tout le monde soit content...

Those beautifulsailors journeyed 
To the South and the North Americas with ease,
In their ships with painted sails.

Si j'étais le Messie, je ferais des miracles,
N'importe où, mais PAS n'importe comment,
Et les gens s'étonneraient, criant :
""Au nom do père !""
Si j'étais le messie, j'inventerais une crèche,
Pas n'importe comment, pas pour n'importe qui,
Seulement pour les enfants.
Les enfants grandiront, croyant toujours bien faire...
Si j'étais le Messie, je me ferais crucifier,
Pas par n'importe qui, pas n'importe comment,
Et les gens pleureraient,
Ne sachant trop que faire...
Je ne suis pas Messie, heureusement pour ma mère,
Qui ne pourrait plus vendre sa virginité,
Car les gens l'achèteraient,
Croyant toujours bien faire...
Il why a très longtemps, il why eut un Messie,
Il est venu d'ailleurs, d'une autre galaxie,
Et les gens l'ont tué...
Ils avaient cru bien faire !

Au seuil de ton antique
Aux ornières d'un parchemin,
Je me risque à poursuivre
Les lignes de sa main...
Silhouette de version latine,
Elle déguise le Vésuve
En parpaing magique
Pour aller faire des ronds dans l'Au-delà !
Puis dans une infusion d'orties,
Au détour do même parchemin,
Je me plie, elle me prie
A descendre le cours de ses reins...

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

I've lost my taste for toys

Her baby blues and long white lace

And still I haven't a date.
Waiting by the moon,
Sipping Whiskey sours.
I'll think I'll wait here 'till noon.

'Til I find some flowers,
So I'll send you a bouquet.

Chorus 1:
Uptown, run around, hear the sound, of the city streets below,
And people in a rush everywhere.
No rain, sugar cane, just a grain,
In my champagne glass, you know.
You put that magic touch in the air.

So they say, it's closing time again,
Funny how time passes,
Through a bottle of Champagne.
The only sound I hear, is that of rattling glasses,
And people laughing in my ear.
You've taken far too much, since you left for Paris,
You've got that magic touch.

So I'll start another book.
Seems I've read them all,
I guess I'll make a call,
Or tune to the news.

They say you're lookin' fine but you just smile
You may be fooling someone but you're not fooling me.

Everything's the same,
Seems I need a change,

By my window,
I catch the falling snow,
But then watch the late-late show.

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always one reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort there

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe, in this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness, that brings me to my knees

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie

May you find some comfort there

When I saw a small dispute,
Over girls of ill repute, naturally.
Then the lights went out,
And I took a subtle hint to leave.

Lift a toast to the past,
Drink to the future at last,
Then fill another glass,
'Cause it's comin' up much too fast.

[Chorus]
Can you feel it, Can you feel it at all?
Can you feel it, Can you feel it at all?

Sittin' on a fence,
Breaking your defense for affection.
Watchin' every move,
Though you haven't got a clue or suspicion.
You know you're looking fine,
But you're thinkin' there's some kind of connection.
You're asking is that all,
Lookin' through a crystal ball for direction.

Lift a toast to the past,
Drink to the future at last.
Then fill another glass,
'Cause it's comin' on much too fast.

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Do you remember, I'd asked you once
If you will follow me even into death

Now, here's your ultimate chance
To take your oath, you've sworn on me
Don't pray to God for he is dead
A new Messiah has caputred your minds

One folk, one lord
One man to lead you into your
Salvation, extermination
We will change the world forever

Am I human or divine?",I Need You,2000
Angel Dust,"[Originally by Rainbow]

You don't know what's happening, you want to go home
But there's nowhere to hide
You walk out on stage, your first time alone
The crowd's going wild
And you feel so alive
You could stand up and take this all night
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid

Jokers and women they hang 'round your door
They're all part of the scene
Just like a junkie you've got to have more
It's a pleasure machine
And you fly every night
But the dressing room mirror don't lie
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid

Your audience died, faded away
Leaving you on the stage
It's been so many years since that first matinee
It seems like an age
Encore one more time

for the ghosts of the past in your mind
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
You're living in a dream
You're the spotlight kid
You're in love with the spotlight



",Spotlight Kid,2001
Angel Dust,"It's a tragedy, that's coming near
Hatred chains our thoughts, born in fear
Makes our children be martyrs of vanity
Sacrifice in another gods name

We speak of love and mercy 
While only bullets answering every thrown stone
We praise our lord in heaven
But all our deeds are by blood and pain

Let's lay down our swords now
And let the blood dry now
It's not our destiny to be enemies
There can be a tomorrow
So let the blood dry now
No war can last forever

Time of killing lasts for so many years
Life lights burn so fast, all that's left are tears
Do you really believe our gods want us to kill?
Not one word of our belief tells this is out lords will

Time runs fast for you and me
But still our souls can be saved by the glory of love
Take the hand that reaches out for you
Let's end the madness before it's too late, too late

Angel Grant,"I've been watchin' you a while
Your walk, your talk, even your smile
Keepin' my attention focused just on you
I wonder if you're here alone
Or if you have a girl at home
Tell me I just wanna know
Then you turned around
And gestured to your boys
Like you were rollin' out
So I said

Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But I'd really like to know
Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But wouldn't you like to go

Somewhere to grab a bite to eat
So we can talk in privacy
And learn a bit about your personality
The huntress captured by the game
Cause my intentions weren't the same
No I'm not tryin' to take you home
So as you walk out
Say your name again
It's so hard to pronounce
So I said

Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But I'd really like to know
Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But wouldn't you like to go

Out to see a movie
I think that that would be real groovy
I know I'm sounding kinda loony
Cause that's what I like
Cause I like people watchin'
Here I go again
I see something I like
So I say

Hey you, hey you, hey you

When I knew nothing about love

And I thank God from up above

I love you
I love you

I never thought that we would go all the way
I never thought that I could form my lips to say
I love you
I love you

Since you've gone away the days are long
And my love grows stranger
I can't hide these tears
And yet my heart it grows fonder

You taught me how to love and just how to communicate
That's why I sing this song to you and to only you

So emotional

Tryna find an ass I can put my fucking foot in
Run this shit no I run this shit
Don’t give one fuck bitch I done this shit
I did what I say I did
Did not fabricate one bit
I have been the fucking realest since my exit near the clit'
That’s where I was born fuck what you on
All about me bitch fuck what you doin'
Round of applause bitches happy with some garbage
Show my whole fucking ass like a fat bitch in chaps
But I’ll be running that shit like a motherfuckin' tracker
Like I run on sense like a motherfuckin' chopper
Like a cheetah in the jungle but I’m motherfucking faster
Like a pre-teen boy in the church with a pastor
Hold up I’m not serious I’m just playin' psych
Fuck your opinion bitch I mean it when I’m sayin' that

I just popped up out the blue, I’m spontaneously combusting
Spit a little different, give me just a minute
Beat the beat down bitch, fresh it then I kill it
We are not the same but they don’t really get it
Tell ‘em do the math, hoe, fraction, division
Sick flow sick ho, drop me in the clinic
Eat 'em 'til the end 'til they back at the beginning

When that loves outta sight and your hearts into focus
When ya floating in oceans hopeless soaking in misery

They just staring from the outside
And then they judging your in, when they
Kick you and beat you and hurt you then leave you
Laying on the ground like you half of they equal
Gladly defeat you then laugh to your face
When you feel all alone, when ya so outta place
They can't relate to this pain
They don't feel how I feel

So don't get lost tonight
Never let the ignorance cost ya life
You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight
Put your headphones on and turn off the lights

There's angels in the airwaves tonight
And I've been running all of my life
And I need you to stay, I need you to stay
Angels in the airwaves tonight

When the girl that you love won't look in your direction
When the guy you like adds you to his fucking collection
When you all dressed in black
And they whisper and snicker
And they make you feel wrong for being so different
This for everybody who knows what it is
To feel like nothing but a memory that won't be relived
That distant fucking shit that everyone forgets
The words on the tip of tongues that gets swallowed with the spit
See I know how it feels
I've been there before
I had head in my hands and my heart on the floor
I've been worthless and shattered
I've been nothing to people
I know what it is to have to force them to see you

So don't get lost tonight
Never let the ignorance cost ya life
You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight
Put your headphones on and turn off the lights

I've been running now
I'm outta here today
I've been running now
Questioning my faith
Questioning my faith
There's angels in the

For when you feel so invisible you're not even sure you exist
So you cut yourself open just to see if you real
You numb yourself with drugs just to hide what you feel
You drink the washed up pain in hopes of rejecting it afterwards
You live everyday wishing you could rewind your life backwards
Because you wanna figure out where the fuck you went wrong
'Cause everything in your world ain't been right for so long
I know how it feels
So this is for you
If you're thinking it now
If you're wanting to die
If you're thinking it out
You are so much more than you are in this moment
You never know how great you can be
Don't give up on you
I didn't give up on me",Angels & Airwaves,2013
Angel Haze,"April's Fool

Dead skin on the flesh of your halo
Drunk love on the breath of an angel
Time frozen in the ash from your blunt
And you breathe like you had life trapped in your lungs
And you wanted escape, and I wanted to take
Every thought from your mind and just throw it away
As I've watered you've grown
I've deflowered your soul
You a seed that I planted with a thought of a rose
And I thought I'd impose if I ever had the energy
And I would save somebody if I ever had the memory
I cleared up some space and invited you in
You were brown and I tried to make you violet again
And I brought out the sun and the violence of wind
And I tore off your thorns and they died in my skin
Yeah
And I watched you, become beautiful
It's funny what the dirt does, when it's suitable

I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

I'm April's fool
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until it sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head
I'm April's fool

Yo
Freeze frame cause the view is so cinematic
And the opening to you was so hemorrhagic
But my first mistake was thinkin it was easy
And that you'd love me if I really let you see me
Deep thoughts in the abyss of your brain cells
One shot to wherever your pain's held
And it became something I'd never seen before
And now my heart too small to beat for anything but yours
Though my perception's is varied as your shade change
And the burdens gettin heavier than weight gain
And we kept swallowing the sun until the shade came
And kept on knockin on the clouds until we made rain
All the flowers in the garden share the same range
And a rose by any color share the same name
But I love you in a way that will not cease
'Cause you're hideous in ways I cannot see

I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

I'm April's fool
If we take the flowers stem and walk into the rainbow
Remember to water them and watch how quickly they grow
But as quick as clouds come in and drown them in the rain so
We can take the potters and anoint them with the same ho
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until you sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head

So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

It seems like yesterday that I was nothin'
Then all of a sudden I'm a volcanic eruption
Then all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion
And I'm all up in your face yellin', ""Bitch, you can't tell me nothin'""
'Cause I came from the bottom, now everybody's watchin'
I said it was my time, now I'm who everybody's glockin'
And I'm just out here sprintin', I'm runnin' right through my vision
I'm trying to outrun my past, but still trying to defeat my limits
'Cause you only get one moment in this life to be great
And you give it your all despite what it takes
And you never let 'em kill you, you take everything they give you
And throw it right fuckin' at 'em and tell 'em it doesn't build you
And no it don't ever break you, and no it can't overtake you
Life's like a bed of roses, you take the thorns and you make do
Sometimes you have to hurt for the 'cause to be reached

I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm born to destroy the fallacies, stop creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell 'em who they should follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty and death reserves for fulfillment
You the only person alive who holds the key to your healin'
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your suns hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain comes
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't material things in the world
That can change the fact that you feel lonely
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose the light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here and I know how you feel, so

Sing with me our battle cry
Ooh ooh

All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight

It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
That anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say fuck everything, but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
'Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me ""go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything that you're about to""

Angel Haze,"You should write a song where the concept is…
You’re basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice
To your mother, when she was your age

I don’t know
Maybe I would write you a happy ending
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you
Or maybe I’m naïve…
Maybe I’m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed
It would somehow grow inside you

Spent so much of my time wishing you were different
But reality is that with life can't never be provision
But if I could wish for one thing, I’d go back and I’d fix it
I’d tackle all your obstacles and kill 'em with precision
And better the intentions of every single person
Who'd play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is
I’d shower you with purpose, I’d wipe hate off the surface
I’d reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it
No more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching
No more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you
Yeah, said nobody else could hurt you
And if they ever tried too I’d wipe 'em from the Earth too
Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too
I know that you been running from everything that’s behind you
I know you’ve been burying everything deep inside you
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you
But I’m stuck sitting in this time frame
Struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game
One day it could get better, maybe it could get better
Maybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather
Know you hated your mom, know it went through your mind
You were just like me, wish that you had more time
To see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel
Wouldn’t lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger

Everything is different now, nothing is the same
And nowadays I swear it feels like you don’t know my name
But I look at the mirror and I see you every day
I’m you in every way, every hue and every shade
And maybe you should know, it’s the last thing that I wanted
Cuz what I hate about you makes me feel like I’m haunted
And I don’t wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and-
So I’m just gonna confront it, yeah I’m just gonna confront it
And tell you that I love you for everything you made me
And that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry
God lives inside you, you’ve already found him
The Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you
And I despise your church for every fucking thing they taught you
It’s just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you
That I wish I could wipe off you
And I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you
Everything that it caused price I wish it didn’t cost you
Losing a part of me that would follow you to Hell
Follow you to hatred, or follow you to jail
Followed you to patterns that I could never get out of
Now I realize that I could never make it with that love
Now I realize that shit is the alternative outcome
Never wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some
I just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on
I wish you knew that you could never make it without love
For your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else
Cuz I would help you find you
And if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy end in peace

Because, you are such a special thing
You’re not just my mom, but you’re the reason I exist
And the best life that you could’ve had for yourself without making a mistake
Would have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood
And even though my childhood wasn’t perfect and I still love you
I just want you to know that if I could go back and do one thing for you
Or be one person for you
I would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could’ve had a nicer life
And a nicer childhood, that you know
You would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation
And not have the strength to leave
But just so that you would have been happier and stronger
Even if I didn’t exist, even it meant that I was never born
That’s what I would have wanted for you

Yeah, and if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too
I know you’ve been running from everything that’s behind you
I know that you’ve been burying everything deep inside you
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending

I don’t know
Maybe I would write you a happy ending
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you
Or maybe I’m naïve…
Maybe I’m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed
It would somehow grow inside you
And that I could hide you from the rain
So that it could be easier for happiness to find you
Or maybe I’m still a kid who’s caught in a dream
I’m the heir to the throne of a princess who’s still trying to be queen
Or maybe we’re all just caught in the winds of a massacre

Angel Haze,"""And the light, the lighAnnotatet can make everything feel beautiful. It can make it feel safe, so safe that, like, in the night, we spend all of our time running away from our truths. And then we meet someone who tells us, 'God will always love you, no matter what you do. The only thing that will never stop loving you is God.' And because of all of our darkness—which at night I still run from, which at night we all still run from, we get stuck chasing light. That's a Black Synagogue.""

""And God said that the meek shall inhabit the Earth! But there shall be masses, I said masses!, of bloodshed first! And that will open the floodgates of Heaven, and pour down upon us His blessings from the floor, to the ceiling, but only if you praise Him, I said praise Him, shall you receive His healing!""

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

I been running from the pain in my brain
Got stains on my scene while I search for the real me
Search for the real me, lost in the night
Only talk to angels when I'm lost in a height
I don't really wanna get lost in my mind
So I pray until I feel I'm getting lost in the vibe
Then I took the bottle up and I drink it to my what?
Yep, drink it to my fucking soul's lost in my eyes
But I don't really wanna drown no, 'cuz I'm not that trusting
But I'ma keep coming 'round though, till I'm sure that I found something
And when I tell you what it is, you better talk to God, remember
No feelings, no thoughts allowed
And if pain's a trapdoor then I need God
And so send someone to come walk me out
But don't think, don't talk about it
Wait, don't sing, don't tell nobody
Wait, don't drink, don't fail your body
Wait, don't scream, no, fucking shout it
See, these voices in my head are the fucking loudest
So belligerent, so fucking rowdy
And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded
And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet
So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me
But you know Him well, and I think that you could bring Him near me
So I keep praying, every word that I keep saying
Every part of me that I needed shield from
Every part of me that needs saving

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

None of this's real, when it calls you
Thought I found you, now I'm lost too
I've been listening to service sermons
A lotta redefining, a lot of words reworded
A lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested
A lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons
I've been searching for the truth but it's embedded in lies
Read every single verse until I'm red in my eyes
And God'll only hear you when you offering ties
And protection is the truth
But when the Devil's a lie
But what am I to do when the Devil is I?
And everything I touch seems to shrivel and die?
My mama always said I was a rebel inside
But now I'm looking for some peace and a benevolent I
And how it feels to need that, some humbling pie
And how long it will take when it comes from the sky
Means I'll probably be waiting until I crumble and die
And just wrestling with Satan while I'm struggling by
So, I think, I talk about it
Wait, I drink, I tell somebody
Wait, I sink, I fail my body
Wait, I scream, I'm fucking shouting
Cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest
So belligerent, so fucking rowdy
And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded
And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet
So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me
And you know him well, and I think that you could bring him near me
So I keep praying, everything that I keep saying
Every part of me that I needed shield from
Every part of me that needs saving

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

Did he die on the cross for this?
Do you have any fucking proof?
Everything here is man-made
And I'm just searching for some fucking truth
Cause everything they ever told me not to do
Has always made me question what freedom is
Why listen to the words when they not from you?
And why feel judged when I freely live?
Now I know what the fucking root of evil is
And why peace is dead, but evil lives
Everybody thinking they can talk to you
And what they believe in they hearts are true
Now they feel that they had the right to persecute
Judge, doom to hell and come first to you
Now I don't really know who wrote the Bible
But nothing under the sun goes unrecycled
Take every shot you have with a fucking rifle
Cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival
So, just think, just talk about it
Wait, just think, just tell somebody
Wait, don't blink, don't fail your body
Wait, just scream, just fucking shout it
So the voices in your head fall abruptly silent
And the blood in your veins flows rough and violent
And you see everything with your lifted eyelids
And every burden you carry is eventually lighted
And you talk to God, even when you ain't sure he hears you
And you give it to Him, tell Him, He can keep the pain and fears too
And you keep praying, only now you don't repeat sayings
Cuz you know when you let it go, then you receive Satan

""How many people here look for Jesus to solve their problems? Lots of people. And how many of those people are fixed? None of them know fucking about shit, they're all fucking fucked up. Anything to help you escape. It takes it, it takes something to just say, 'Fuck it! This is reality, I'm gonna deal with it!' But do we ever really deal with it? Deal with it, stop running, stop trying to find these substitutes? Stop trying to find Jesus in strangers, and Jesus in church, and God, and find God in yourself. Powerful thing, yeah?""",Black Synagogue,2013

I pray he doesn't forget me
I pray he doesn't forget me that lonely night in november
When we fell into the hands of the coldest day in december
Then became the product of the trust that we had lost and found
Got you deep in the emotion just to watch you drown
And I had never left the land’s sand
'Cause I was busy building castles for a dead man
Shouldn't have taken my eyes of you
I shouldn't have straddled the lines crossed too
And now I've been searching but can't find you
Hence me being lost since you're the one I'm entwined to
So; is love the picture that we’ve tainted now?
No; Am I still with you when I ain't around?
Am I the subject you tip-toe or walk around?

See, we were deep sea divers

And death does you part when you're focused on its rival
Defibrillator love, I'm just focused on revival
You could, you could put your hands in mine
And we'll walk through the sand, in the sands of time
Until we paint the end of this love scene
Until I'm laid to rest in your blood stream
Until I hear the strings of your heart playing
Until I hear the things you are not saying
Until I find out what it really means
And hopefully it's everything it really seems

Angel Haze,"Take a breath, say you love me
We both know that everything changes

Keep in mind that none of this is fiction
This is just a glimpse into the head of a menace
We were two different children
But we born of the same moon
Blowing entire opposite
We were brought up the same too
I used to hate you because they celebrate you
And you made them notice every single thing I can’t do
But really I honestly wanted to be you
And I just hope my desire to wasn’t that see through
I never took into account the things that you were hiding
I even understood your rage when I see you get violent
I guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded
Until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is
You said to run and never look back
And if I did, to never lose track of all the hurdles I was jumping
That lead me to my current goal

Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold

Took a chance, said you’d love me
We both know that everything changes

You found me when I was dying and unappreciated
You broke me down into a science that I completely hated
You told impeccable talent didn’t make me less average
But how I use it to my advantage determined my passion
It took some time to understand and manage
But then I learned this passion was the method to my madness
And I never got to thank you, at least not in the way I planned
But I had to learn before I did that, I hope you understand
It takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated
All the ashes burned to ashes
And I’m dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you
And even though you ain’t my fan, you did the shit they ain’t do
So disregard my temper and the times I fucking hate you
Because despite all my ignorance I’m really fucking grateful
Never forget the importance of the sparks you hold

Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold

Took a glance, towards the mirror
Now I know that everything changes

I used to hate me, I swore my life was too painful
Let my demons overtake me before I fight with my angels
There was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle
That provided understanding of how much drama could change you
I used to cut myself open just to feel like I was living
But when living is just dying then there’s no longer a difference
There’s no longer existence, and there’s no longer persistence
And there’s no longer a drive there existing on only division
And I thought, if nobody ever loved me
This vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream
Then I looked into the world and saw a million people like me
Probably never know your stories, but you’re the reason I’m fighting
You’re the reason I’m writing; music
Could be so reviving
And if ever you tend to forget, I’m right here to remind you:
Don’t ever give into the hurt you hold

Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold",Dirty Gold,2013
Angel Haze,"Don’t think your love is the antidote
Don’t try to fix me when you know you’re just as broken
Don’t tell me that I’ll be okay
When every time you kiss me you can taste a little pain

We can dance with the stars while I fish from the moon
Using messages bottled to the pits of my womb
And I thought that in the midst of me dyin' you found a cure for me
And magnetize your vibrance and finally had a pull on me
I pictured you running to everywhere you would need to go
I’m up in the air, still running from everything below
Yo, I’m not sure what this is but I’ve got jet fuel in my soul
Propellors tucked in my ribs
We’ll fly

When the tunnel's got no light
And the light exposes this dull life
It’s alright
When the good feels bad but the bad feels better

Planes fly
High enough to take us anywhere
And we’ll go
We'll hear no, breathe no, see no fear
And I know
Trouble will find wherever we are
Keep wishing easy baby
We’ll be closer to the stars

Swallowed my secrets like a bitter pill
Repeat the same mistakes so wounds will never heal
You know the reason I can’t look you in your eyes
But I want your guilty body like you love my dirty mind

We’ll fly
And I would never see you wrong so try
And when everything is gone then I
Will be wherever you reside
With my eyes full of passion
Desire running behind it
I don’t know what that means
But I’m sure we’ll find out together
When the good feels bad and the tunnel feels like forever
And hearts slow sink like a birds’s lost feather
The end all, be all, the pulling to a lever

Planes fly
High enough to take us anywhere
And we’ll go
We'll hear no, breathe no, see no fear
And I know
Trouble will find wherever we are
Keep wishing easy baby
We’ll be closer to the stars

Keep running baby til you find yourself tonight
Keep running baby here you can be what you like
Keep running baby til you find yourself tonight
Keep running baby: spread your wings and fly

Planes fly
Bewind the skies like faded faith
And I’ve tried to live my life at my own pace
But we lose so much time here on the ground
So it’s now
Take your flight or burn it down

Planes fly
High enough to take us anywhere
And we’ll go
We'll hear no, breathe no, see no fear
And I know
Trouble will find wherever we are

No more living in dust
When my memories die

Put my heart on the line
Put my life in the song
Now you, now you, you can sing about me

I spent too much time in recording
Spent too much designin' the current
Meet me at the bottom where it started
Promise I revised and rethought it
And I got that, got that, got shit started
Everything's hard and I know it
I got all the scars, I can show it
Never been exempt, but the funny thing is, never really had friends
Just a bunch of down bitches only down for the moment
All of this shit don't end
I lost so much just to win
And that how it goes? Lord knows, I got holes in my soul
But I would do it all again
So what are people mad at me for?
Is it cause they can't jock my free flow?
Is it cause they know no matter how hard they go
They ain't ever gonna stop my dreams though?

Every words I lay, they gon' hear it
Every single word, they gon' get it

I tried, it was hard, but I did it
Couple more scars, but I'm livin'
Soon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it
(Let me make sure they remember me)
All just survival of the fittest
All just to rhyme for the critics
Everything I want, Imma get it

Angel Haze,"""I remember being asked a lot, by a lot of different writers, zines, and shit, like, 'Why don't you incorporate your race, your ethnicity, where you've grown up, into your music?'

Back in the booth let the tragedy in
Switched up the team, let the magic begin
Told all you haters, I'm in it to win
Way back when them losers wasn't letting me in
All of these bitches is mad at me, so?
Money appeared now they magically foe
Honestly really can't pay it no mind
Because spending that time means I'd rather be broke
I'm out here living my passions and more
Witnessing peace as it pass through my soul
Nothing can irritate masses like literally showing them stagnance can turn into growth
Haters gon hate when you winning this shit
Done for these bitches, they tend to forget
I'm out here yelling 'bitch, look at me now!'
I was underground, now I'm stuck in the clouds
14 whole hours, a trip out to Spain
High in the clouds, bitch I'm gulping the rain
Just a year later still fucking these haters
While facing my fears, no more running from pain
Head is on straight so I'm gunning with aim
No more fucking with bitches who stunting for fame
You can catch me out roofless in something deranged
Ain't it funny how suddenly something can change?

You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around

Back when the preacher said change is to come
All nonbelievers prepare to be sonned
Not talking Jesus but honest to God
I bet I reach my prime before air leaves my lungs
Switched it up bitches, adjusted my flow
Go against me and get wrecked from the go
All of you bitches keep taking your shots
But if one come at me, then it's straight for your throat
Harder than nipples on bitches aroused
Deity swag and omnipotent style
Don't fuck with my bread and don't fuck with my head
Cause if it get to that point then I'm seriously vile
Promise you people that evil's alive
Wish you could see what I see with my eyes
All of the demons that be in mind
So I burned all my bridges and cut all my ties
Said I would do this back when I was 9
Said I would do this before I got signed
Said I would give all these lost kids and doubters
A reason and purpose to question their lives
Look where I am and then look where I've been
Tell me that I ain't destined to win
Never give power to none of you cowards
To tell me what you think my destiny is

You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around

And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

Gone for a minute but back on my grind
Promise you you are no match for my mind
Took all my doubt, whipped it into submission
And forced my ambition to step into line
I know that they do not want me to shine
I know that they do not want me to climb
I know inside that being a boss means making these bitches get back on their jobs
Can anyone fuck with me now? No
How do these bitches respond? Don't
Looking behind to seeing me now
What do they think I'm beyond? Dope
I've just be taking my time, slow
Being alone in my mind, flow
Putting the contents of all that's inside me into this shit I'm designed for
Crossover, pivot, I'm back in the game
NASCAR on bitches, I'm tracking my lane
Focused on bridging the gap
And showing the youth all the ways to accomplish their dreams
Know how it feels when they kicking you down
And it's getting you down
You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around

Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
I know it's hard to be adamant, too
When you stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd
No niggas and bitches and quitters aloud
Ball inside you until the survival of your dreams
Until you are living them out
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around

Who's daughter, who's daughter's on that stage?
I know her, I know her by her name
Who's daughter, who's daughter's on that stage?
She's a queen, now watch her
She's drowning ace of spades
She dances, and she dances, and she drops it
The crowd is yelling pop it, there's a reason she can't stop it
She dances, and she dances, and she pops it
The crowd is yelling drop it, there's a reason she can't stop it

This a
Funeral, death of your innocence
Little Lily grown up, barely legitimate
All these niggas in here got you scared to be intimate
So you just stand there, dance til you temperate
Dance til you in a wick
Dance til you in a wick
You don't feel the flame now, dance to rekindle it
Ran backstage did the bump in the bathroom
Kiss a few strangers and dance til you feeling it

And just keep dropping to the floor
Whatever you moved on to, you can let it go
And just keep dancing on the stage
Instead of throwing ones it's white lilies to her face
Then she got me backstage like
""Let me see your conscience
I'll be over dancing at the table of contents""
You can turn my pages
All these pages are like wages
And I would have quit so long
But all the money I'll be making got me
Dropping to the floor
Whatever you moved on to, you can let it go
She just keep dancing in my face
Instead of throwing ones it's white lilies to the stage

She lets go, says she has it under control
I count slow, hoping that she'll divulge some more
'Cause she knows, everything a woman should know
And I want, nothing but to see it up close
And she keep saying ""just grab it if you see what you like""
And I keep asking if this is what you want with your life

I find the flowers harden out in haunted houses
They somehow escape the gardens and walked out into the concrete and now

Everytime I see her she be walking to the pole
Panties, bra, bra inside, dropping to the floor
She climb up, up, up, up, hiding on the pole
She walk out with all her precious petals gone and now
We can find, roses with no petals in here
We can find, lilies spray painted metal in here
We can find, them dancing with the devil in here
Those white lines and, those white lies

Step off the stage and I'm back in a trance
With you we're interstellar, I'm gassing your nebula
All other flowers, they pale in comparison
That's why my florist's hand's slowly caressing you
One petals, two petals, back on the floor
Touch me, then tease me, then back on your cloak
Everything's seemingly Puerto Rico
This worthless from verses was stirring your soul
Swear I'm not putting you down, though
I just hate seeing you drown, slow
You say your mind frame is twisted and shit
That your faith in humanity's ground floor
I'm always one that say think on your own
Free is the flower who rose from my home
But I'd rather watch you be seated in power than steadily seeing you being dethroned

I found the flowers being drowned in dirty water
They somehow escape the farmers and are headed out to slaughter and now

Everytime I see her she be walking to the pole
Panties, bra, bra inside, dropping to the floor

We can find, lilies spray painted metal in here
We can find, them dancing with the devil in here

Couldn't get it off the ground like bruised wings

Ready for the red tape

A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here
Come in come in

Everybody look around
Everybody look around

The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Want you to want me like I'm all you got
Mama see's seeing it but can't make me stop
Telling the truth it might mean you get broken
But letting it hurt that's my method of coping
Doubt in season like that smoke in my lungs
What they project on me what I've become
Down on my knees unsure what to say
No I never learned how to prey
Don't know, know who I been fooling
But you got me running in circles I'm ruined
Let you inside opened up all my wounds
Taking my ribcage and ripped it in two

Open up my ribcage

Tie off all my tendons
Watch how they stretch
Oh I've got the muscle
But lord, I'm spent
Knocking down my sternum
Began at a young age
Too much space between
Open up my ribcage

I offer souvenirs
A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here
Come in come in

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

There's impenetrable silence inside of my head
There's nothing I can buy when I'm practically dead
I get so tired of writing everything I should have said
That maybe this time I'll put my pen down and just tell you instead
You see I opened up my ribcage and violins flew out
The organs softly played through my violin mouth
I got lights hotter than love hidden beneath my tongue
Written on my skin
It tells me your the one

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Open up my ribcage
Open up my ribcage
Open up my ribcage
Open up my ribcage",Ribcage,2014
Angel Haze,"I won't grow up, I wanna have fun
I just wanna be wild and young
I might say you're my number one
I just wanna be wild and young

Dance, like the type of chick that you wish I was right now
But I know, that haze ain't never gon' get you lovin' now
Is so premature and unconditional that
If I let you drown up in my wish well
You might wish you won't?
Why can't we both chill chill, why chit so real when I thought I'm only down for the night
Bitch I'm all down my bread but i've never been a bird
I have never been a flock or flight
Maybe we can do it in the dark or light
Get elevated, get lost in the height
If I let you taste my flag
Bitch, shit, that bright be the sparky light

Live by the words of a wise man
Who said don't go falling in love
So as much as I can I steer clear of all that stuff
I feel that I am a little less emotional
Took a couple fucking pills, couldn't say that I overdose
Gotta drop slashy, you could call it comatose
Say body higgin', talkin' bout some shit that they don't know
Fuck what you heard like I'm fucking what you heard
Word to my ? and I'm fucking every word
Fucking every word, do some for me now
Play dirty like shoes on the muddy ground
Too smart with the dudes tryna bum me down
But they get played like blues in a fucking town
Get you up in them shoes when they shot you out
Coping it like yes, who's in the fucking house?

Gotta be a numb to miss you like that

Losing my mind, losing control
Swallow my pride, you swallow me up
Smile on my face to cover my hurt,
Spend so much time, but what was I worth
I'm broken-heart, I'm saving it up
Crossin' in my hand, mistaken for love
Nails in my bag, they don't mean a thing
They ain't yours, they ain't yours!

I got trapped off in a blackbox lit from the matchbox of your rage
You say we are mildly players, who's still act off of the stage
I kept begging you to stay like ""Baby, please don't leave me""
""Know you don't like fall but what's one more season?
And I dream on, you gettin' your plot and your scheme on
And I just be here with my theme song
He love me, he love me, no he don't
'Cause you make me feel like the night before Christmas
Love is a crime and I'm stuck in your prison
Far as you want, baby I'll go the distance
If you're numb and I'm numb, then what is we're feeling?!

You don't know what it is that you do to me
Yeah, you steal my heart

Aahhhhhhh  uuuuuuu
Que difícil perdonar el daño que yo te causé
Cuando mas necesitabas mi cariño  se que te fallé
Recordando y me arrepiento tanto y tanto
Por hacerte llorar y se que estuve mal si
No me puedo imaginar mi amor 
lo tonto y  lo cruel que fui
Poseo lo de tu corazón 
y me arriesgué a perderte así
Uno nunca sabe lo que tiene hasta verlo  partir
Pero que ciego fui amor
Pero que seria de mi si me abandonas y te vas
Nunca cambiaría mi manera de pensar
Pienso que mi vida nunca nunca fuera igual
Por eso te pido otra oportunidad

Tan solo aquí esperándote

Porque yo no podría imaginar
Mi vida solo si tu no estas

Yo tengo los motivos por lo cual yo te hice sufrir
Me deje llevar por todo el mal 
y en el ambiente me perdí
Me deje caer en tentación 
y al pensar me puse llorar
Como te pude traicionar
Que seria de mi si me abandonas y te vas
Nunca cambiaría mi manera de pensar

Que me perdones y regreses a mi
Muero sin verte no quiero perderte
No puedo imaginarme sin ti
Vuelve a mis brazos de nuevo y seremos felices
Perdóname baby
Nunca jamás yo te haré llorar no no no no no no no
Te sigo amando necesitando
Yo siempre estaré
Si no te tengo en mi vida amor
Yo no se que voy a hacer

Hoy mi destino nos alejará
Why en mi corazón siempre estarás (lo sé, yeee)
Hey, porque el amor se fue
Es dificil el tener soportar
Tanto dolor por tanta soledad
Que me hare tanto mal (que me hare tanto mal)

Esto que siento yo es mas allá que un gran amor
Pero todo se derrumbó why ya no hay más que tu dolor
Hoy te pido perdón, me estoy muriendo
Porque se va el amor
Why mi último respirar

Ella no duerme, no sale, no come, no ríe, no dice nada

Hoy mi destino nos alejará
Porque en mi corazón siempre estarás, (lo sé, yeee)
Hey, porque el amor se fue

Aún puedo escuchar tu voz
De tantos deseos why ahora tienen tu calor
Mi destino nos traicionó
Why hoy mi alma se va sin tu perdón
Aunque me falte why la dicha de tu amor
Si mi extrañas mira al cielo
Que en esa estrella estaré yo
Porque el amor se fue yeee yeeeee, se fue ye yeee, se fueeee uuuuhh
Porque el amor se fue yeee yeeeee, se fue ye yeee, se fueeee ieeeee
