Mägo de Oz,"Si has perdido la fe 
Si vas a abandonar
Si no encuentras tu sitio
Si estás sola
Si el fracaso se entera 
De tu dirección

Si lloraste al caer 
Ríete al levantar
Si una pena estrangula 
Tu mirada
Desmaquilla tus ojos
Que los bese el sol

Sé bien lo que duele perder 
El norte y no encontrar 
Tu sitio, tu lugar

Sigue la luz sino encuentras el camino
Sigue la luz que se esconde en tu interior
Aprende a volar con las alas del destino
Aprende a soñar y podrás tener el sol ¡oh! 

Si llegaste a olvidar 
A que sabe el reír
Si olvidaste regar 
Una promesa
Plántale algunas flores 
A tu corazón

Si has dejado morir 
Sueños por realizar
Si la melancolía 
Es tu condena
Líbrate de cadenas 
Y ponte a vivir

Serás lo que tú quieras ser 
Yo te acompañaré 
No hay nada que perder

Sigue la luz sino encuentras el camino

Sigue la luz sino encuentras el camino
Sigue la luz que se esconde en tu interior
Aprende a volar con las alas del destino
Aprende a soñar y podrás tener el sol
¡oh!",Sigue La Luz,2012
Mägo de Oz,"Ahora que me he quedado solo, que me queda poco de ti
Solamente la culpa y un futuro que yo vendí
Ahora que se ha acabado todo, casi antes de comenzar
Voy buscando algunas respuestas pues no paro de preguntar

¿Quién prescribe las pócimas de amor? 
Pa curarme de mi y lo que soy
¿Quién receta sonrisas por perder y dejar ir? 
Lo único que yo amé

Y a pesar de que no estás, te llevo cosida a mi piel
Tu recuerdo se ha instalado en mi a vivir
Y aunque nunca volverás, busco en el trastero de mi 
Ese beso abandonado que nunca te di

Ahora que vivo en el olvido. Ahora que vivo en el ayer
Que mi corazón se ha partido en miles de trocitos de ti

¿Dónde esta la sonrisa que olvidé? 
Solo queda la mueca que inventé
¿Quién derriba los muros que hace tiempo levante 
Para esconderme de mí? 

Y a pesar de que no estás, te llevo cosida a mi piel
Tu recuerdo se ha instalado en mi a vivir
Y aunque nunca volverás, busco en el trastero de mi 
Ese beso abandonado que nunca te di

¿Quién prescribe las pócimas de amor? 
Pa curarme de mi y lo que soy
¿Quién receta sonrisas por perder y dejar ir?

Tu recuerdo se ha instalado en mi a vivir
Y aunque nunca volverás, busco en el trastero de mi 
Ese beso abandonado que nunca te di",Xanandra,2012
Mägo de Oz,"Cuando despiertes un día 
Y sientas que no puedas más 
Que en el nombre del de arriba tu vida van a manejar
Si sientes que el miedo se pega a tu piel 
Por ser comunero y justicia querer 
Si te rindes hermano, por ti nunca pensarás 

Cuando vayan a pedirte los diezmos a fin de mes 
Y la santa inquisición te ""invite"" a confesar 
Por eso amigo tú alza la voz 
Di que nunca pediste opinión 
Y si es verdad que existe un Dios que trabaje de sol a sol 

Ponte en pie, alza el puño y ven 
A la fiesta pagana, en la hoguera hay de beber 
De la misma condición, no es el pueblo ni un señor 
Ellos tienen el clero y nosotros nuestro sudor 

Si no hay pan para los tuyos 
Y ves muy gordo al abad 
Si su virgen viste de oro, desnúdala 
Cómo van a silenciar al jilguero o al canario 
Si no hay cárcel ni tumba para el canto libertario 

Ponte en pie, alza el puño y ven 
A la fiesta pagana, en la hoguera hay de beber 
De la misma condición, no es el pueblo ni un señor 
Ellos tienen el clero y nosotros nuestro sudor 

Ponte en pie, alza el puño y ven 
A la fiesta pagana, en la hoguera hay de beber 
De la misma condición, no es el pueblo ni un señor 
Ellos tienen el clero y nosotros nuestro sudor 

Ponte en pie, alza el puño y ven 
A la fiesta pagana, en la hoguera hay de beber 
De la misma condición, no es el pueblo ni un señor

Mägo de Oz,"Si has llegado aquí 
Si has sabido encontrar este, sitio este lugar 
No te eches atrás 
Déjate guiar por mi voz y verás que los sueños se pueden cumplir 

Sólo has de olvidar todo cuanto aprendiste ayer 
Sólo has de dejar tu inocencia brotar 

Si crees en mí yo haré que todo sea
Del mismo color que el de la eternidad 

Si olvidaste sonreír
Si olvidaste que una risa te puede curar 
Del mal, de soledad 
Ven y acércate, volaremos a un mundo distinto, a otra realidad 

Sólo has de llevar de equipaje sonrisas 
Y por mapa tú tendrás solo imaginación 

Dentro de ti se abrirán puertas 
Lleva una brújula para encontrar risas 

Somos de una lugar donde nadie nos puede encontrar 
Ven, despiértanos y no te arrepentirás 
Los aplausos que tú nos des han de bastar 
Para volver del más allá 

Somos de un tiempo de brujas y hadas 
Somos los hijos de la rebelión 
Los condenados por anhelar la libertad 
Di abracadabra y nos tendrás

Mägo de Oz,"Soy la voz del miedo y del adiós y soy principio 
Y fin soy frió y calor 
Yo soy el príncipe de toda soledad
Sígueme no hay nada que perder 
Si quieres ser feliz podemos construir algunos 
Puentes mágicos a otro lugar 

Yo soy el miedo a envejecer 
Soy partida de ajedrez 
Que tu alma juegan por ser inmortal 

Ven a mí el cielo te puede esperar, rézame 
Y no morirás, el dolor de perder se escurrirá, es tu 
Vida si te entregas al fin a mi 

Soy la paz soy guerra y al final soy lo que piensas 
Tu amor llanto y dolor 
Soy la manzana envenenada del edén
Entra en mi te llevare a un lugar 
Donde se esconde el mal donde las lágrimas
Son prisioneras y su cárcel es el mar 

La vida es solo una ilusión 
Un espejismo fue dolor 
Que el sueño eterno ara cicatrizar 

Ven a mí el cielo te puede esperar, rézame 
Y no morirás
El dolor de perder se escurrirá
Es tu vida si te entregas al fin 

Ven recuéstate en mí y el dolor se dormirá 
Entrégame tu alma ven ahógate en mi 
Te llenare de ausencias los recuerdos del ayer 
Para asesinar nostalgias de tu ser 

Yo te doy la eterna solución te libro desde hoy de todo tu pecar 
Invocame por que la santa muerte soy

Ven a mí el cielo te puede esperar
Rézame y no morirás
El dolor de perder se escurrirá
Es tu vida si te entregas al fin

Mägo de Oz,"Llueve luz en mí de una vega sideral 
Explosiones de alguna estrella fugaz 
Viajaré a mi ser desdoblándome de mí 
Agujeros negros se burlan de ti 

Implosionaré traspasando el umbral 
De otra dimensión de luna bifocal 

Lágrimas de un unicornio y un dragón 
Juegan con mi nave cerca del colchón 
He viajado sobre la luna de orión 
Puente aéreo hacia la realidad 
Pidiendo permiso para aterrizar",Constelación Alpha DCI,2014
Mägo de Oz,"En un barrio de obreros crecí 
Y ahí fue donde aprendí 
Que en la vida siempre hay luchar sin parar 
Sin parar 

En la escuela yo nunca aprendí 
Pues las calles fueron mi único tutor 
En el parque yo me gradué en chicas y 
Rock and roll 

De los curas salvando mi piel ese honor 
Con el que te envenena cualquier religión 

Soy lo que todos esperan de mí 
De la piel del Diablo yo soy 
De una estirpe que está por venir 
Que empieza por ti 

Hasta que un día me enamoré 
Y puse precio a mi piel 
Y casi dejo la música y mi alma 
Por las piernas de una mujer 

No hay beso más poderoso 
Que el de una canción 
No hay corazón que no arda 
Al oír rock and roll 

Soy lo que todos esperan de mí 
De la piel del Diablo yo soy 
De una estirpe que está por venir 
Que empieza por ti 

Soy el guardián de las noches en ti 
De la piel del Diablo yo soy 
El canalla que muere por ti 
Si tú te vas 

Soy lo que todos esperan de mí 
De la piel del Diablo yo soy 
De una estirpe que está por venir 
Que empieza por ti 

Soy el guardián de las noches en ti 
De la piel del Diablo yo soy 
El canalla que muere por ti

Ahora que ha acabado todo, sé que hoy voy a morir 
Y sé que la sentencia sobre mí, es muerte, soledad
Tengo miedo, pues ya oigo su voz

Hoy el sol se ha derretido en mí
La luna ayer se ahogó
Se ahorcaron las estrellas 
Colgándose de mí

La inocencia ha venido a por mí 
Vestida de mi ayer
Con la mirada de un adiós 
Del niño que yo fui

Mi condena es la soledad
Y no morir, y no vivir
Y mi pena es la eternidad
El tiempo escolta mi sufrir

Bienvenido seas al infierno 
Donde podrás llorar
Donde el dolor se escurrirá llenándose de ti

Bienvenido amigo al fuego eterno

Si pudiera cambiar 
Todo aquello que olvidé 
Por querer sobrevivir

Y aunque tarde, no puedo evitar

Grita ausencias en mí tu voz
Susurra muerte el viento en mí

Bienvenido seas al infierno
Donde podrás llorar
Donde el dolor se escurrirá llenándose de ti

Mägo de Oz,"Mi primer poema lo escribí a perder mi gran amor 
La primera letra que escribí fue la carta en la que dije adiós 
La primera estrofa que canté fueron llantos al nacer 
Por los gritos cuentan que elegí por nana un rock & roll 

Desde que tengo razón 
ella ha sido mi consuelo, ella es mi voz 

No voy a dejarte nunca pues tú eres mi amor 
No voy a olvidarte mientras viva 
No te cambiaré, tú eres mi primer amor 
Pues mi casa es una canción 

El primer qué país al que viaje lo hice sin mover los pies 
Una melodía me llevo de turismo hacia mi vos 
La primera vez que dije amor mi alma hablo por mí 
La primera vez que me vendí mi guitarra se rompió 

Pentagramas en mi piel
tatuando me destrozas mi canción 

No voy a dejarte nunca pues tú eres mi amor 
No voy a olvidarte mientras viva 
No te cambiaré, tú eres mi primer amor 
Pues mi casa es una canción  

Si abandonas una melodía, un verso, una canción 
Se te cubrirá de soledad tu rock 

No voy a dejarte nunca pues tú eres mi amor 
No voy a olvidarte mientras viva 
No te cambiaré, tú eres mi primer amor 
Pues mi casa es una canción 

No voy a olvidarte nunca, solo abrázame 
Entre versos se anida mi voz 
Y si he de morir, que me entierren junto a ti 
Sobre el ataúd de una canción",Melodian,2014
Mägo de Oz,"Hay tantas cosas que no te di 
Tantos besos que me perdí 
Que aplace por crecer, por vivir 
Hoy yo te quiero pedir perdón 
Por no ser un hijo mejor 
Y olvidar que sin ti no soy yo 
Nunca te alejes de mí 
Estoy solo y no sé qué camino elegir 
Sigo siendo el niño aquel 
Aunque estés lejos de mí 
Yo te llevo en mi piel 
Yo he salido de ti 
Moriré siendo de ti 
Mmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmmm 

(patricia tapia) 

Sé que en tu pelo ayer nevó 
Que tus canas te las pinto 
El reloj, con el tinte de una flor 
Ven que se escurra la soledad 
Por tu sonrisa y no volverá 
Pues tu piel todavía huele a el 

Nunca te alejes de mí 
Estoy solo y no sé qué camino elegir 
Sigo siendo el niño aquel 
Aunque estés lejos de mí

Yo he salido de ti 
Moriré siendo de ti",Moriré siendo de ti,2014
Mägo de Oz,"Bienvenidos a mi país 
Ocupen ya su localidad 
Hoy en el circo del horror 
Verán ""robar a un concejal 

A un ministro, a un senador
Malabaristas de la comisión 
Equilibristas de la subvención 
E ilusionistas del capital

Desahuciaron su sonrisa

Soy la voz que en ti

Las paredes de mi habitación

Con lágrimas sobre mi piel

Duele más que tu frialdad

Tengo sed de beber tu voz 
Aunque este muda de amor

Si supieras las noches que robo al olvido pensando en ti
Si supieras lo roto que me has dejado el corazón
Y a pesar de que duele, te juro que trato de estar sin ti
Como el mar, tus ojos serán donde naufragar

Soledad, dime dónde están esos ojos que robé 
Para en ellos navegar, pues en ellos encontré mi mar
Soledad, dime si es verdad que hay un sitio para mí 
Desde que ella me dejó, mi condena tengo que cumplir

Y otra vez he vuelto a perder 
Esa sonrisa al amanecer
Despertar oliendo su piel 
Antes de hacer el amor

Si supieras las noches que robo al olvido pensando en ti
Si supieras lo roto que me has dejado el corazón
Y a pesar de que duele, te juro que trato de estar sin ti

Que existen sogas de amor

Y esta carta llega a su fin
Me despido, cuídate
Aunque te olvides de mí, no te olvides de vivir

Mägo de Oz,"Esta es al verdadera historia de mery

Ella era un volcán con cuerpo pa'pecar 
Sus cabellos rojos eran como el fuego 
Donde todos querian arder 
Y quemarse hasta el amanecer 

Despues de cerrar la barra era ornamento 
De varones jovenes para cenar 
El otro menú lo daban más adentro 
El pescado del día tal vez 
Y la almeja en su jugo pa díez 

Por condena soledad 
Y entre sus piernas un quízas 
De volver a sonreir 
De volver a ser felíz 

Dulce mery donde está? 
Quíen robo tú juventud 
Alquilando algo de amor 
Tú oficina era un colchón 
Extendiendo cheques de dolor 

Y asi conoci a esa bella tabernera 
Cuando estando hambriento yo pedi cenar 
Ella sonrio de forma le sugiero 
La comida ella me ofrecio 
De rodillas me comio la 
Pocas veces he cenado tán liviano 
Pocos sitios hay con menú tan especial 
Salimos sofocados y no era verano 
Aún conservo el cerco de carmín 
Rodeandome la otra naríz

De volver a sonreir 
De volver a ser felíz

Quíen robo tú juventud 
Alquilando algo de amor

He dejado de cenar allí

Que era una locura de esperanza y libertad 
Donde tus demonios salen a actuar 
Donde una mano amiga sabes que te sostendrá

Y si vuelve el olvido y con él el dolor 
Date solo un momento, recupera el honor 
Para todas tus penas, si hay una solución

Pues mientras cantes no puedes caer

Si has sudado penas del que quiere abandonar 
Diles si has huido antes de saltar

Lo fácil que es volar

En la desesperación
Que un mar de silencio al llorar

Cuando te parten en dos
Cuando se agota el valor

Y preguntan por que hoy te cuesta tanto sonreir

Despierta y grita al mundo que vas a volver
Somos más no hay camino a la rendicón
Aquí está la revolución
Déjame oír tu voz

Grita fuerte y déjame oir tu voz

Y apenas puedes seguir

Ésta no es vida y talvez
No haya más que un destino a favor

Aunque solo estés tú no te rindas y empieza a luchar

Somos más no hay camino a la rendición
Aquí está la revolución

Recuerda que al final puede ocurrir
Si una puerta se cierra se vuelve a abrir
Grita fuerte y déjame oir tu voz

Recuerda
Aun quedará valor debajo de esa piel
Bajo nuestra piel

¿Reniegas de Satán, de sus obras y sus vicios?
¿De la necromancia, de la magia y del tarot?
Yo soy la virtud de la Iglesia y sus principios
Si no te arrepientes tu alma se condenará

Hoy la libertad se ha quedado dormida y en silencio
Hoy la libertad, ha cerrado por defunción
Hoy la libertad, se ha muerto de pena y melancolía
Hoy no hay libertad, hoy Dios no esta aquí ni vendrá

Quisiera ser olvido, para nunca recordar
Quisiera ser brisa, y así acariciar, la vida una vez más
Que fría es la promesa de otra vida junto a Dios
Si en esta ni estuvo, ni supo de él, la hoguera es su ataúd

Antes de morir, y que el fuego haga su oficio
¿Aceptáis a Cristo, a su iglesia y su poder?
¿Renunciáis al Dios llamada Naturaleza?
Gaia es sólo madre del pecado y del terror

Hoy la libertad se ha quedado dormida y en silencio
Hoy la libertad, ha cerrado por defunción
Hoy la libertad, se ha muerto de pena y melancolía
Hoy no hay libertad, hoy Dios no esta aquí ni vendrá

Gaia

Hoy la vida llueve penas
Gotas de desesperación
Mis lagrimas, son ríos, venas
Desangrándome el corazón

La memoria de una mujer
Son los besos que recibió
En tus labios yo viviré
Y en tu olvido yo moriré

Hoy mis lágrimas se quieren suicidar
Acurrucadas, morir en tu piel
Han nacido secas, tienen sed
Mi llanto hoy se quiere morir

Como un beso prometido
A tu alma es mi voz
Soy lo muerto y lo vivido
Soy la calma, soy tu Dios

Cierra los ojos y te llevaré
Donde los sueños se hacen canción
La vida duele, te curaré
Duérmete y sueña, te acuna mi voz

Hoy mis lágrimas se quieren suicidar
Acurrucadas, morir en tu piel
Han nacido secas, tienen sed
Mi llanto hoy se quiere morir

Si tus lágrimas se quieren suicidar
Guárdalas pues vas a llorar
Llorarás océanos de Paz
Duérmete ya no hay dolor

""En nombre de la libertad
La fe en uno mismo y la Paz
¡¡Quemad las banderas! ¡¡No a la religión!
Y que tu Dios sea canción
Compuesta por el corazón
Y que tu país sea donde te lleven los pies""

Diabulus in Gaia, missit me Dominus
Diabulus in Gaia, missit me Dominus

Missit me Dominus
Missit me Diabulus
Missit me Satanas

Ahora al fin soy aire
Y mi maldición caerá
El fin de esta iglesia muy pronto vendrá
Mi voz despertará

Hoy la libertad se ha quedado dormida y en silencio
Hoy la libertad ha cerrado por defunción
Hoy la libertad, se ha muerto de pena y melancolía
Hoy no hay libertad, hoy Dios no está aquá ni vendrá

Hoy la libertad se ha quedado dormida y en silencio
Hoy No hay libertad, hoy Dios no está aquá
Hoy Dios no está aquí, hoy Dios no está aquí ni ven drá!

Padre nuestro, de todos nosotros
De los pobres, de los sin techo
De los marginados y de los desprotegidos
De los desheredados y de los dueños de la miseria
De los que te siguen y de los que en ti ya no creemos

Baja de los cielos, pues aquí esta el infierno
Baja de tu trono pues aquí hay guerras, hambre, injusticias
No hace falta que seas uno y trino
Con uno solo que tenga ganas de ayudar, nos bastaría

¿Cual es tu reino?
¿El vaticano?
¿La banca?
¿La alta politica?
Nuestro reino es Nigeria
Etiopía, Colombia, Hiroshima
El pan nuestro de cada día son las violaciones
La violencia del género, la pederastia
Las dictaduras, el cambio climático
En la tentación caigo a diario
No hay mañana en la que no este tentado de crear a un Dios
Humilde, justo
Un dios que este en la Tierra
En los valles, los ríos
Un Dios que viva en la lluvia
Que viaje a traves del viento y acaricie nuestra alma
Un Dios de los tristes, de los homosexuales
Un Dios más humano
Un Dios que no castigue
Que enseñe
Un Dios que no amenaze, que proteja
Que si me caigo, me levante
Que si me pierdo, me tienda su mano
Un Dios que si yerro, no me culpe
Y que si dudo, me entienda
Pues para eso me dotó de inteligencia
Para dudar de todo
Padre nuestro, de todos nosotros
¿Por qué nos has olvidado?
Padre nuestro, ciego, sordo y desocupado
¿Por qué nos has abandonado?",La Cantata del diablo,2017

I be that man they call Timbaland
On these funky beats right here you hear him?
Uh huh, uh huh, now, how many people want to, huh
Learn this method that I have with these beats?
Uh huh, uh huh, now

How many songs I'm gonna hear on the radio
That sound like mine? Uh huh, uh huh, now
To have a partna as well as my friend
Well I have two partnas as well as my friend
And one goes by the name of Maganoo A.K.A. Magoo, word
You know what I'm saying? I'm putting this man down
'Cause he got it like that, don't bite him

And of course Missy Elliott
We put it down like that for the 96 and 97
[Incomprehensible]
This is my dialogue on this album
It's Magoo's album featuring me, Timbaland
You know what I'm saying?

'Cause he's so ill, I can't even rap over it
Maybe Magoo can rap over it, but I can let him rap over it
'Cause I got my man Jimmie D on that engineer board
And we do this like you know everyday, all day 24 hours

You know what I'm saying, I'm making this money
I ain't got to rap, you know what I'm saying
All I got to do is talk on this track
And you will still buy it, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's like that, so Missy tell me what I'm gonna say

Beep, beep, beep who got the keys to the jeep?
Vroom, I got 'em baby, beep, beep, beep, beep

Alright, now it's time for me to go
I done told y'all 'bout the sad show
The music's so ill, knida make one niggas want to kill
You know what I'm saying

Big up to Larell High
That's my east school coast, word
I know you gonna play this in your Eddie Bauer, word

Can you bang it Larry? Uh huh
You know why you banging it? I'm out
Who the F is this? What

Magoo,"See, them other crews could not figure me
It's the Mag and double ooh, got that fat CD
Buck a crystal, hit a nigga with my club Willy
Fake MC's getting assed like they eatin' chili

Only way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly
Maybe I'm Nicole Brown 'cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin' me but you ain't O.J.
I'm 'bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay

When I bumble, watch your back 'cause I sting like bee
This ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't cool Moe Dee
Watch a movie, now, you think that you really Joe Pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy

I'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland
I drive a 850, sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van
You can catch me standin' in my be-boy stance
Or catch me at home watchin' 'Who's the Man?'

They call robber 'cause I pack much heat
Don't call me now, because they dig the way I speak
I'm like a genie because I've been trapped in a bottle
I've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado

Come, follow a mad brother where'll there be no sun
Tomorrow you be sayin', when can we meet?
My office hours are nine to five
Ain't that right Maganoo, Maganoo? Right

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night

Now gimme that and run with the
Party people, are you ready for Tim and Maganoo?
As we come, rum and Coke, won't you kick a verse two

Yo I'm 'bout to get it started like I'm Hammer then I farted
You retarded if you thinkin' Brandy really broken hearted
I departed doin' dirt, lookin' up your girl's skirt
Keep it Steve Martin style, bustin' loose like jerk

I get up like town, gimme, don't say no more
Got them scars on my face 'cause my health be poor
You Milli Vanilli, I'm Kurtis Blow like eighty-fo'
No, I don't want your girl, she be suckin' my big toe

You get death like row, I take a beanie then I jet
Peace to Tupac 'cause he was dope as it get
Twisted but you ain't Keith Sweat and shit got hot
Make a block then make a circle then I rock that spot

The rappin' Don, I make a dyke go straight
If you think I'm cute then you up too late
Make no mistake, I'm a question with no answer
Riddle me like the Joker get burnt like JoJo dancer

They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah

I'm elated, that keep it real is outdated

Describin' how I'm risin', hypnotizin'
Got comments, put replies in, no lies in
If you do, your life will need revivin'

When I'm sleep, I die, when I wake up, I'm born
I leave the earth each day to get my soul reborn
So to God, I pray, I make it through this day

Child abused as a child, child Magoo, buck-wild
Welfare, met the cake, too much sugar in the cool-Aid
Misfit until I fucked Jill on the hill
Look out, heads up, to the girls, let's buck

Like night, shade grows, workin' dope, mind flows

Like no other love before,

Just erased all the sadness away, oh oh oh,

See the kitty cat
Gotta gold it like a light
In the night you the freak I'm out wit
Don't bite
No diggity, who took you out
No doubt when I first got down
Made the bro' shout
Look out, make it live
Dip and dive, stayin' alive
Shoot me sugar, there it is
Now we talkin' square biz

We gotta love ya, that's real, uh

To all my ladies in lingerie, never under age
Who stay gettin' paid, who like to take trips where the sun is shade
To my women who love to ball out
And spend all that money 'til ya all out

I feel like a pimp with a different pimp game, with a different pimp name
With a little pimp fame
I'm loaded with cash, loaded with class, loaded with a lot of things
Even got a gat loaded for that ass

I love my mind, love my soul, love my body
I don't drink or smoke that's why I love my body
You might catch me chillin' with a little short hottie
With a little piercing on her body

Yes, I get it poppin, 'specially overseas
Japenese girls even love my beat
They say, ""Timbaland's we love you
We love the dope things that you do""

Even in London they say, ""Tim, we love ya""
They even call me things like wicked and the f'n governor
That's why I can't forget why'all
That's why I had to make this roll call, uh

[Chorus:]
This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh
Life's too short for some time out, oooh

It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh

I heard the feds hate me 'cause I'm so live
From five o'clock to four-oh-five sellin' quarters and dimes
Even Magoo got a watch I ain't dumb
Ain't no familiars in this place where I'm slingin' it from
I got wholesale weight, that low-sale weight
Or any kind of weight that make my dough flow stright
'Cause I'm oh so great; real thugs, no fake

Thugs hate - everything I stand fo', throw hands fo'

Crackin up like, ""Damn, which one of why'all paid?""
A pretty boy got hookers thinkin that the blows don't trade
That's the day that the curls slide under the braid
I'll give you somethin sharp to raise that line in your fade

Rubber band around the wrist, be the type to grip

With a Corona in the holder I'm the latest bitch

Yup - when you fuck with the greatest clique

Yo (yo), yo, ay yo
Timabaland's flow infamous
Allow me to assemble this flow with limitless style
For all man, woman and innocent child

I have no perimeter
Break all barriers in various areas
My sound is mimicked
Track prime minister, some say sinister

None stoppin the groove until when it's
The climax, some niggas is bitin my hot hats
And followed my drum pattern, but I done that
It's time to change, get more deranged

Feels more strange (doooodooooo)
Follow me through gravel and shallow trees
From mountains to flat plain, to thunder and black rain
Through the dream state of utopia

Woke up to the sounds of that man Timbaland
Five Mexican bitches scopin us
Belly dancin, sayin ""hell, he's handsome"" in Spanish
We was fine until the subtitles vanished

Then and open fire, totin opium
Higher than I ever been in my life
Heard cries throughout the night like

Ay yo, I woke up to a bowl of rice like the Golden Child
T.V. playin like the Poltergeist, must been on overnight
I saw a strong beam of light, decided to walk to it
Could it be the son of Christ, I decided to talk to it

In the halls I heard music shoutin beautiful calls
And I swore I heard a voice say:
It's yours my, gift to you, to do what you choose
But I suggest you do what you do to make the spirits move

I hear ya dude, and me bein a barrel of fruit
But your ears heavenly, when I sit in this chair and produce
Then my hallway darkened
I felt a power surge rush throughout my apartment
And the glance callin like

[Chorus]

Mag spit with a sense of purpose on purpose
When you was eatin collard greens I was eatin these dreams
I stepped in dog shit and bit Skid Row twice
Only ice I had put it in my orange Slice

What you know about livin in a jail when it ain't no bars
Handcuffed with no key, world denyin your plea
A third-degree charge when it ain't no crime
Twenty-six years old and I got more time

Phone overdue, baby on the way, low pay
Low rent for your mom, gotta get away
Smoke, hate now, then you want to talk about the ghetto
I'm tenth generation of that, came out the womb with a hat

Polo on and Nikes with a gold tooth
I'm Superman, I can spit from any phone booth
You and your cold ass crew do what you do
Just remember Mag never feel good, I am the flu

Give me Lifestyles, put 'em on my jimmy, it's on

And I ain't playin games when I heart
And leave Mag hangin hard suit with Christopher Darden
I take about a hour to bust
Chickens want to get with Mag so they makin a fuss
Told 'em, ""simmer down, you're next

Go on a bogus mission to, somethin you crip-walk in the kitchen to
Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
and all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick
You can let your mind cruise for miles
They can't tell no sucker who's allowed, with a strap on the mic

Big body, too, just like I walked out the gym
Man, I'm sppeding through, not just feeling the wind
Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end
Now, I'm needing to sin, lying again
Pumpin' gas in the Benz, with no money to spend
And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again
So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins

Don't get it twisted, I'm gold-toothed and two-fisted
Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed
I'm past being beserk, I go to work
Tell the boss ""Go 'head give me some sugars and hot sauce""

Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off)

And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted
You got cash? man stop frontin
Living off damn every record that you cutting

Every other month I get a brand new car!

Yau [echo 2x Yau]
They still won't give me my props
Now I'm pissed off
why'all will see the other side of me
Come on
Like this

I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be
If a nigga didn't make his entry
Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats
Waiting on my arrivlary
why'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me
Instead of always comparin' me
If I hear one more remark about me
I guess I gotta ride on my enemies

What the fuck would the music be, if it wasn't for Timothy
When the game is feverish, then I create the remedies
And crumble leads until I'm buzz and I'm laxed
And them hoes show me love in every club that I'm at
For every hood got' get back, what another nigga envy
But I swear I ain't no killer, but why'all niggaz 'bout to tempt me
To the point there the barrels empty until you gon' recent me
When Morpheus missing the desert of the real he meant me
Like a monster I am simply, do the records into three
Let my music not really be confused with anybody
'cause there's something like Mister Mohammed Ali in his prime
then I float like a butterfly and sting with the rhyme
and the mic happens ring with the nine
if it's drama let these niggaz tryin' to bring to my mind
I seem to remind that Thomas Crown is spoke
and if you don't love it you can shove a dick down your throat

I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be

Look at my eyes nigga, wakin' up early in the morning to the sun rise nigga
Momma yelling rise nigga get up out that bed snoarin'
if you want it go get it fuck havin' to beg for it
Even if you gotta break your neck I'm a releg for it
I said listen to behind a hot roller bread for it
Contemplating know how to work my math and bred story
I don't work my fingers to the bone until they bled storin'
So you can say that I'm a giant a preacher of habit
walking over these watches squaking the reach in the head with
niggaz watching me go free not just a week in my marriage
with the game in the cabbage with my name and my status
but I remain as the baddest motherfucker 's established
and I 'm still at it grounding that Hennessey straight popping that still mad at
Down at my enemies' face and you're like a kill habit
In front of my enemies' face I shit like a steal rabbit
To show I'm his real static and hold me ideal at it
With my poker face until I at least make a mil at it
At least make a meal love it I'm hungry and still clutch it
All for that mil ticket outta that steal lovin'

Well I was riding 95 to Virginia the other day
And I thought to myself ain't this where Timbaland used to stay
I heard he moved to New York City but he work in Miami
Only time he back round here is when he visit his granny
Now ain't it funny how the money make a man change
But shit Timmy I don't think he changed a damn things
'xcept the rap game and bust the track game
shit he be gobbeling the grammies like he pac-man
can you get with that man let's gone take it back to the roots
before them backpacking rappers with them hoodies and boots
before Sam Goddie and MTV
before these killers and these hundred dollar billars feeling making MC
before the white rap explosion before the corrosion
when we was just getting started and them doo's wouldn't open
it was people like Timmy who was kickin' them in
shit whatcha cookin' in that kitchen again

Oh!
You know what?
([Wyclef:] good good good)
I go through a lot, since my baby girl's not here
Life ain't been the same for me
Lately I miss you very much
I want you to hear my pain that I go through (go through ...)

[Verse 1 - Timbaland + (Wyclef Jean)]
It's been three years (AH!), livin this fast life
I think on it, I know one day I won't have life
People don't know me over the time be	
They don't want to know me, they want to know my G's
Le I quit, things ain't the same no more
But I'ma do my thing 'til there ain't no more (yeah)
I got a plan, I wonder how far I can go
I demand the best for myself, that's all I know
I, done seen the world become
Products of a revolution that we begun (yeah)
Make me want to split a swisher, I need me one
They keep on copying what we done done
That's why I say ..

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Timbaland"")
But I know why'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
But I gotta grab all these leaves
So I must ..

[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
Hey, Timbaland you gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over
([Timbaland:] My pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
([Timbaland:] I can't quit yet), you can't quit

You gotta hold on, you got to be strong
([Timbaland:] Uh, my pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah

[Verse 2 - Magoo + (Wyclef Jean)]
Pain, can't you see the pain in my eyes?
The lie behind my cries, don't you sympathize with me
You don't have to wonder when I come
You label me a bum, you fake it ain't suprisin me (yeah)
Funny how Oo got money, people come around
Soon as Oo fail, kick 'em to the ground (yeah)
Not just neighbors, the whole damn town
Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown
But as the world turns, my life can too
And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah)
I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?
Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse
It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah)
Oo is a man, so I must hold on

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)

A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Maganoo"")

I've seen prom queens, turn into prom fiends
Sometime I ask myself what happen to Dr. King's ""Dream"" (yeah)
I've seen best friends, turn to enemies
What made it sad, I had to sing at the eulogy
So hard for us to say goodbye
So I puff the lye and stay high (yeah)

I remember those days when I was holdin back
When Star Crunch was a popular snack
Would you buy you that, sneak the rest in my nuts
You know that Johnny Appleseed and that frozen cup
We grew up, but ain't you sister Jean cousin (cousin)
Just cause we older that don't mean nothin (nothin)
We still could hit the beacon, a couple of Bible meetings
Live right just like the deacons and backslide on the weekend
Now things change, not just your new love
See you never used to trip off material stuff
So I ain't mad at dude cause he rimmed up his truck
Just mad at you, you clumsy klutz
And it's no surprise how I'm feelin inside
So the only thing you ever probably did for my eye
Used to tears in the bucket, I hope you dummies loved it
Although it's over, you still my soldier (my soldier)

I'm just tryna take them burdens off of ya
Cause I make mistakes like you
I forgive ya boo

I first met ya at the strip club
Instead of one, had to give ya two dubs
Right from sight baby, I was past love
It must be the fact, opposites attract
Do the addition, it's a one on one thing, and I'ma lace you with bling
Cause the way you make me feel is an incredible thing
But you had to hurt me, made love to my best friend
But just like ""Chucky"" I'ma stay 'til the very end
On top of that, you was usin crack and cocaine
You had oomph, had to throw my towel in mayn
I can't judge cause I cheated, you ain't hold no grudge
I had a child with her, baby it's warm in love
Then Christmas Eve we was playin two hand spades
You rolled on up, Ace I'm sorry but I have AIDS
But I'ma ride with you, until your death
And I'ma stay by your side, last heartbeat, last breath

Wondering why we so close to buildings on this last flight
Pray at night and keep my ""Run"" posted by the door

What gets the real time wondering where Aaliyah at
I got a wife that watch another girl give me neck
Fix my lunch with plastic wrap up on my pita bread

I'll bite my tongue but she's so outspoken
To that box of Saran bust her head wide open

I'll be walking in

All you think about fuck paying bills
You ignore em' you gone drink it out
That's the way that I feel as I am writing this

Sit back roll up a blunt take some delight in this
You been invited to a piece of my sanity
And vanity is absent does that weaken the man in me
My fantasy on side man reality bites

Who can't believe all these rappers let alone what he writes
I wasn't forced to lie to why'all but I did
I don't own a plane or yacht or eat squid but
I'm entertaining there will be no explaining

I'm criticized for having fun
Killings more enovating they say
But anyway however ignorance chooses food
It's rude to tell you how you have been screwed

And I'm a part of the problem
And its racking my brain
Excuse me miss I'm half fool half insane

That's why I keep a runny nose
And I wish my problems would go (Oh)

The greatest rappers man suffered depressions
So I'm signing niggas while Whodini's taking the publishing

I think I need seven just to make the playoff

But I ain't gonna hit tonight, I'ma leave a good impression before I catch my flight (come on)
How I'm wrong when you ain't right?
When your dumbass will be right on my flight (stupid)
There goes my shenanigans, laugh with me

There ain't no need for panicking
Chill out, you on a private plane
Just lay your head back to this kirkle bang
Eat some peanuts, sip on some champagne

Your fly mileage go up as you give me brain
This is what Thomas do, piss on my mark then I get back to you

I'm hoping that you want to spend these two nights on me
I like your home girls you like my homies
We ain't really tryna spend these two night lonely

Shawty, really ain't much I'm asking for
A little conversation, a nice piece of ass to go
I like penetration, how you like it fast or slow?
Only a hip, nobody has to know

She looking at me, weighing up her options
She ready to leave, and go get it poppin'
What could be the fact that I got there
Drop top Benz or that single in the top 10?

I dunno but whatever it is gotta::crunk
She grabbing her liquor, coming out of Prada
I told her I'ma pimp it, I ain't coming out a dollar
Let's go! I'm leaving gonna be out of here tomorrow

[Verse: Magoo]
Girl you lookin' right in those jeans
You been eating colligreens?
That's obscene, your man don't help you make beans?
You have a house, 2 kids, and he working

There's rumors, he and your best friend been flirting
But I ain't tryna fuck you tonight
Your ass big, but your face hmmmm that look alright
I tell you what, I'ma make an exception

Clothes off, that's the truth
Clothes on is deception
Aw, yea, a macilent conception
Front or the back, hit in any direction

And baby you the cause of my erection
Stop at Wal-Greens I'ma buy some protection
Fuck that, go and put it in my face girl
I really have a need to give you face girl

You said you dreamed if sex with a star
Make up your mind, Oo be on a jet tomorrow

Act bigger, make the shake stick her, so they can at least figure
Then we hit the slopes
Same amount of snow, that Johnny would it nose
No chain and ropes, I don't chestize my hoes
Just release the low, and put little me's on clothes
But still though I got (love for you)
Single mothers I got (love for you)
Fuck niggaz who hatin I got (love for you)
Middle fingers I keep'em (up for you)
Couple bottles with models

If I vanish tomorrow, niggaz will follow the flow
See a hundred like towers, watch me pull in the load
When I come to ya clubs, niggaz will be stare at the doors

Thirteen with the big dream and
Daddy said I could be anything

Found an acoustic guitar
Started learning
Wrote a couple songs and
People heard them
Now they sing along

My friends used to say
""I bet you can't wait for the fame
Everyone's gonna know your face, mate""
Let me talk specifically

Oh, child, see I once had an idol
I got her voice on a vinyl
And then she turned suicidal

I didn't even want you here

I might want to, don't know how to

Say I do, with a song

You recoup, who seek who
Who need who, where we lay
You need truth, you need more
Than I'm coming through
Shoulda never got too comfortable
Shoulda never looked over you to get under you

Upon a lonely hill
As the shadow of the cross arose
Upon a lonely hill

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Hark how the angels sing
Hossanah in highest
Hossanah to your King

And once again the scene was changed
New earth there seemed to be
I saw the holy city beside the tideless sea
The light of God was on the streets
The gates are opened wide
And all who would might enter
And no one was denied
No need of moon or stars by night
Or sun to shine by day
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away

Sing for the night is o'er

Hossanah evermore

Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die

When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!""

To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace, their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1993

And the people that I meet
The children in the playground

The little corner newsstand
And the house a mile tall

Of a garden all in bloom

And you sit alone with your thought
While the chimes ring out with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brought

Do you think what the end of a perfect day
Can mean to a tired heart
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray
And the dear friends have to part?

Well, this is the end of a perfect day
Near the end of a journey too
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong
With a wish that is kind and true

With colors that never fade
And we find at the end of a perfect day
The soul of a friend we've made",A Perfect Day,2004

To hear the angels sing.

O'er all the weary world:

They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds

Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,

Thou Lamb of Calvary
Savior divine
Now hear me while I pray
Take all my guilt away
O let me from this day
Be wholly thine

May thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart
My zeal inspire
As thou hast died for me
O may my love to thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be
A living fire

While life's dark maze I tread
And griefs around me spread
Be thou my guide
Bid darkness turn to day
Wipe sorrow's tears away
Nor let me ever stray
From thee aside

When ends life's transient dream
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll
Blessed Savior, then in love
Fear and distrust remove
O bear me safe above

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

I don't mind the gray skies

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Resto qui affacciato sul terrazzo
Tu nemmeno sai cosa mi hai fatto

M'hai fatto perdere la sete
Cuore consumato e sul marciapiede
A parlare ma da mesi mi sveglio senza niente da dire
M'hai fatto perdere la sete
Credevo di avere il futuro tra le mani
L'ho perso di vista
Più, lo seguo più
Mi trovo fuori pista

Non mi sentiranno mai
Non mi capiranno mai
Come un pazzo che guarda la Luna
Non mi sentiranno mai
Non mi capiranno mai
Come urla da dietro le mura
A passi lenti verso la sconfitta
Con la schiena dritta
Non mi prenderai
Non mi prenderai
Corro corro tra la nebbia fitta
A testa alta ma
Non mi prenderai
Non mi prenderai

Ci vediamo e mi chiedi ""come ti va?""
Quando in fondo sai bene come mi va
Sono anni che vado in giro
A fare sempre la solita commedia
A fare sempre la solita scena
Di quello a cui non gli va bene niente
Vedi che tutto diventa un problema
Tipo camminare in mezzo alla gente
Volevo dire ciò che avevo in mente
Vedi alla fine si capisce uguale
Non è possibile vincere sempre
Quando si perde però fa male
E non importa quanta gente in giro ho conosciuto
Se parli un'altra lingua è inutile gridare aiuto

Non mi sentiranno mai
Non mi capiranno mai
Come un pazzo che guarda la Luna
Non mi sentiranno mai
Non mi capiranno mai
Come urla da dietro le mura
A passi lenti verso la sconfitta
Con la schiena dritta
Non mi prenderai
Non mi prenderai

Mahmood,"Ho bisogno di partire per un po’
Tornare in quel vecchio coffee shop
Ho bisogno di svegliarmi in una casa non mia
Nel cesso di una discoteca o di vincere alla lotteria
Per gridare forte forte forte per volare via
E non scordarmi di me e non scordarmi di me

Certe cose esistono solo nei film
Mai in una vita sola
Per salvarmi non basterebbe King Kong
Né domani né ora
Scelgo la noia su questo divano disteso
Brucio tutti i miei pound
Brucio tutti i miei pound
Brucio tutti i miei pound
Come fossero Pesos

Ho bisogno di partire per un po’
A piedi, su un autobus, non lo so
O sdraiarmi sull’asfalto
Di un cinema all’aperto
Mangiando popcorn
Fino a scordarmi di me
Fino a scordarmi di me

Certe cose esistono solo nei film
Mai in una vita sola
Per salvarmi non basterebbe King Kong
Né domani né ora
Scelgo la noia su questo divano disteso
Brucio tutti i miei pound
Brucio tutti i miei pound
Brucio tutti i miei pound
Come fossero Pesos
Come fossero Pesos
Come fossero Pesos

Sognavi di planare su campi di grano
Trovare i tuoi cerchi, sembrare un alieno
Ti chiedi se sbagliare sia umano
Ma dimentichi le spade sul trono
Seduto davanti a un videogame
Senza il coraggio di premere play
Senza il coraggio di premere play, play, play

Certe cose esistono solo nei film
Mai in una vita sola
Per salvarmi non basterebbe King Kong
Né domani né ora
Scelgo la noia su questo divano disteso

Brucio tutti i miei pound
Brucio tutti i miei pound

He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride

While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back

When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene

""It's time for bed""

Te da miedo que no ame las figuras que tú adoras
Te da miedo que come, que bebe, que reza
Te da miedo y el miedo no te deja conocerlo

this is from a girl that told me
well she just walked one day and met this little boy he had
well she happened one day to meet this little boy
a face that you can't stop watching
a face that you will remember
a face that you want to hold in you hands carefully 

And she got the
feeling he was in need 
of what she could give
Cause she had it all ready to blow out of inside
So she wanted to say 
“hey I'm gonna take care of you yeah 
We're gonna be like a crew” but she didn't 
cause she couldn’t ever replace
Chrysanthèmes


The boy was going doubtless
She followed him walking on hills
nothing could have slowed him down
his schoolbag dragged on the ground

He opened an old rusty gate
and entered a flowery place 
So she hid behind 
a big tree and blind, she heard these few words from him cause he said

“hey you wanted me to do it,   
well, I am just the new champ!
For real, I just held my breath and all the children were all applauding!
Mum, they gave me a medal
Me and dad, we wanted to bring it
So you can keep it and be proud”
But she then realized he was speaking to
Chrysanthèmes


And she got the
feeling he was in need 
of what she could give
Cause she had it all ready to blow out of inside

Qui invente des souvenirs
Tu pourrais a nouveau tout redessiner

Allez viens tu peux bien prendre l'avion demain
J'ai perdu l'habitude des gens qui pensent a moi
Je t'attends dans le noir

N'aie pas peur
Oui je te suis
Je prends de l'altitude
Je pense toujours a toi
Attends-moi dans le noir

Des formes accrochées, des étoffes moirées
Des plumes, des galons, des perles véridiques

Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

And I am always strong
And she makes me sweet and young,
But when somebody else comes
She doesn't want to come along

Behind my back and smile
When I don't know what
I should do, do with all this crap
But she never shows up, and what kind of friend is that

I don't know what happened

This will happen again for sure
So please just dare

And the scariest from home who don´t seem to care

But I know my words don´t count today
'Cause I´m not there right now and she knows

I thought I caught your eye
You reminded me
There's nothing to see

But maybe you are wrong

That would be quite fair
When you're never here

And it should, it should be winter now
But my mind is still June
And you should, you should
Have given me your wings by now
So I could catch your eye

And I am not alone
I'm here with someone
She never got the chance
And I hate myself for that

'Cause my heart stopped to
But some just for a while
Should I be thankful?
No, I hate you for that

Have given me your wings by now

Where she falls, nobody knows
Save your breath
Let those snake eyes roll

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
Bounce between forever and what may never be
Let the light of love keep bouncing off
The diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just an in articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me
There is a diamond in the dark

Catch that flame, let it warm your soul
Love's cruel game, is the great unknown
All that fear
Do you know you're not alone

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
Bounce between forever and what may never be
We bounce between decisions, destinations constantly
Let the light of love keep bouncing off

Just an in articulation of the heart

All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-daffier
 
I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
They're the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding love with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all
 
I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls

Sometimes gets me in trouble too

This state of grace

Oh like we used to do and won't you

Maia Wilson,"What’s the issue, dear?
Why are you holding back from such a man?
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

Or the grumpy way he talks?

Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
Weirdness of his feet?

And though we know he washes well,
He always ends up sort of smelly.

But you’ll never meet a fellow who’s as

Sensitive and sweet!
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,
So he’s got a few flaws.

Like his peculiar reindear,

His thing with the reindeer.

That’s a little outside of nature’s laws!

So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,
But this we’re certain of
You can fix this fixer-upper
Up with a little bit of love!

Can we please just
Stop talking about this?
We’ve got a real, actual problem here.

I’ll say! So tell me, dear
Is it the way that he runs scared?

Or that he’s socially impaired?

Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods, what?!

Are you holding back your
Fondness due to his unmanly blondness?

Or the way he covers
Up that he’s the honest goods?

He’s just a bit of a fixer-upper,
He’s got a couple of bugs
His isolation is confirmation
Of his desperation for human hugs
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,
But we know what to do
The way to fix up this fixer-upper
Is to fix him up with you!

Enough! She is engaged
To someone else, okay!

So she’s a bit of a fixer-upper,

That’s a minor thing.

Her quote 'engagement' is a flex arrangement.

And by the way I don’t see no ring!

So she’s a bit of a fixer-upper,
Her brain’s a bit betwixt.
Get the fiancé out of the way and
The whole thing will be fixed.

We’re not sayin' you can change him,
‘Cause people don’t really change.
We’re only saying that love's a force
That's powerful and strange.
People make bad choices if they’re mad,
Or scared, or stressed.
Throw a little love their way.

Throw a little love their way.

And you’ll bring out their best.

True love brings out their best!
Everyone’s a bit of a fixer-upper,
That’s what it’s all about!

Father!

Sister!

Brother!

We need each other to raise
Us up and round us out.
Everyone’s a bit of a fixer-upper,
But when push comes to shove.

The only fixer-upper fixer
That can fix up a fixer-upper is

True! true!
True, true, true!
Love (True love)
Love, love, love, love, love
Love! (True love!)

True

Maiday,"What if the very thing that threatens you, is the very thing that beckons you
Roll up your sleeves, pull down you're hood
Why do all the bad things feel so good?

'Cause there's only one way, one way to fix it
One way, one way to make it better
One way to get out of this place if you want it

If you want it you can fix it, there's many who have dared
I tried, I've been inside for twenty two years
You could lose everything, they could bury you here
Very few leave in a merry mood here
But you never knew I've been in every room here
I know a few secrets that very few share, but listen
They don't even notice me, a bit of courtesy to clean the dirt you leave
It's a one way street can you work with me?
It's a five-star suite, something lurks beneath
Don't scratch the surface, don't turn a cheek
Don't speak of anything you have heard or seen
The lonely ignore you, the more you speak
And don't forget to wash your hands before you leave
There's something fishy in Cabana, maybe its the piranhas
This place will turn you crazy, think they're saving me for afters
I'm asking

'Cause there's only one way, one way to fix it
One way, one way to make it better
One way to get out of this place if you want it

Yeah don't forget to wash your hands before you leave round here
We've gotta clean this toilet
Can't sleep or breathe, the heat is boiling
And in between good and evil, don't eat the poison
Follow your heart, if you can't beat them, join them
Walk into reception, seek employment
There's one way to change if two of us can make it
Why is it the bad things that always feel the greatest?
Bottle of grey goose, you're wearing the same suit
But you don't look as good as you did when you came through
Blunt in your suave shoes, be wearin' the blame truth
They say you and the devil are sharin' the same rooms
That's the very thing that threatens you
Overcome that demon and there's meaning in the methods used
There was never no hell or armada
Our version of heaven, Hotel Cabana

'Cause there's only one way, one way to fix it
One way, one way to make it better
One way to get out of this place if you want it

Yeah why is it the bad things which always feel the greatest
(one way, one way)
Sometimes we gotta break away if we wanna make a change
(one way, one way)
Anyone can say they ain't afraid but when they face to face
(one way)
With their worst fears, will they remain the same?
Is this hotel the perfect place to stay?
If you find a way out then stay out, never return again

One way, one way to make it better
One way to get out of this place if you want it",One Way,2013

You look like
Someone I could fall for
So look down
If you dare
I'm not scared
Let's fall boy
And it feels like flying
I can see the earth turning around
Hold on me really tight
Baby I want you with me when we hit the ground

I wanna feel alive again
Let's make it real
Just tell me when
You never know unless you try
Just hold your breath and close your eyes

I wanna skydive tonight
Flying is a frame of mind
Close your eyes and jump


Let's get mine
broken heart
My wings are in repair
So I stay
On the floor
When love is in the air

And it feels like flying
Standing on the edge of the atmosphere
Hold on my really tight
Baby it's a long way down from here

I wanna feel alive again
Let's make it real
Just tell me when
You never know unless you try
Just hold your breath and close your eyes

I wanna skydive tonight
Flying is a frame of mind
Close your eyes and jump

Close your eyes and jump

Close your eyes and jump

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

Sure plays a mean pinball!

There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'

Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

ay, yo no quiero, siendo sincero 
Por eso te buscaré
tocarte toda es lo que quiero
ay, yo no fui quien te boté 

Tú te fuiste sola 
Y contando las horas estoy yo 
Es que me diste jaque mate 
Antes del primer saque 

Acostumbrado a ganar siempre pero te perdí 
Yo sé qué te pasa, tú 
pensando qué pasaría si yo

Cómo se hace el amor
una vez más quiero probar el sabor
quiero sentir tu calor 

No puedo más, yo sigo llamándote 
Como un loco estoy buscándote 
Cada noche deseándote
tú quieres lo mismo, yo lo sé

Nena dímelo, oh
sí o no, oh
decidelo oh
De aquí nos vamos tú y yo 

No digas que no si sé que quieres, eres 
Diferente a otras mujeres 
Para mí que lo tú tienes son poderes, quieres 
Que me apodere y que nadie se entere 

Siempre hacemos los deberes
ya no conocemos los placeres
Vamo' a hacerlo fácil, solo quiero que cooperes 
Dejemos que la gente se altere

Maimouna Youssef,"It don't feel right, don't feel right, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle
But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston
The money missing and there's mouths to feed
Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?
Something don't feel right out here

It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman
And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing
My main adversary any silly concoction
Freeze your face like botulinum toxin
If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?

It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing clear
It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, children working, weapon producing
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all got to make that living
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Who never had shit and ain't got nothing
But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'
Hot zone for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free
If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD
Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me

It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more

I only write raps just to give you niggas hits
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's 20 years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long

At the age of 19, heard the scene
A lot of M.C.'s that do not come clean
Fronting on dealing hard times in rhymes
You see him in the streets and you see no signs
Of the hell, and they get on stage and tell
Some cornball war story, ring the bell (word)

[blam] Aww shit, another young brother hit
I better go over my man's crib and get the pump
Cause to the cops, shootin brothers is like playin baseball
And they're never in a slump
I guess when they shoot up a crew, it's a grand slam
And when it's one, it's a home run
But I'ma be ready with a wild pitch
My finger got a bad twitch, plus I'm on the switch --
-- side, and step up to the batter's box
Fuck red and white, I got on Black Sox
But let him shoot a person from the White Sox
What's the call?  Foul ball!
Babe Ruth woulda made a good cop, but he didn't
Instead he was a bigot, dig it
My life is valuable and I protect it like a gem
Instead of cops gettin me I'm goin out gettin them
And let em cough up blood like phlegm
It's grim [blam blam] but dead is my antonym
And legally they can't take a fall
Yo check it out it's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Two:

R.B.I. -- real bad injury
But don't get happy you're in jail for a century
Just as bad as bein shot in the groin
To see who'll shoot ya, they'll flip a coin
And watch him run for the stretch
But you don't know the man is at home waitin to make the catch
So the outfielder guns you down
You're out, off to the dugout, underground
I know a cop that's savage, his pockets stay green like cabbage
Cause he has a good batting average
No questions, just pulls out the flamer
[blam] And his excuses get lamer
Once a brother tried to take a leave
But they shot him in his face sayin he was tryin to steal a base
And people watch the news for coverage on the game
Hmm, and got the nerve to complain
They need to get themselves a front row seat
Or sink a baseline for a beat
Cause television just ain't designed for precision y'all
It's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Three:

A kid caught on, but I don't know where the brother went
The umpires are the government
I guess they took him out the game, and replace him
with a pinch-hitter, in the scam he was a quitter
So the cops usually torment, I mean tournament
Win em I was sayin
You can't let the umpires, hear ya speak and battle
like the other kid you won't be playin
Cause they'll beat you til your ass drop
A walking gun with a shell in his hand is their mascot
And when they walk around let it be known to step lightly
The bases are loaded
My man got out from three strikes
In the skull but the knife he was carrying was dull
Instead of innings, we have endings
What a fine way to win things

Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, and he fiends

Surrounded by the ghetto plus the fact that the brother's black
But Roger gets high -- grades on tests
He smokes -- brain cells to rest
But brothers jel on him because he has a goal
And gold awards hanging all off the brain pain
Behold, Roger doesn't fight, his brain is his left and his right
But if tainted, he just might
So all you brothers flying with a broken wing

But didn't advance or enhance no scholarship, cool

Teased because he wasn't making G's at a crack spot

Attained a job as a manager at a bank
Roger started rolling a Benz
Had a bunch of rich friends and that's where his ghetto life ends

Always in good spirits, and money's never made

Remembers his fear and smiles ear to ear
Counts a knot and goes to ?Backa Jaluts? to eat

Roger's a Cassanova now, he's swimming in women
A symbol in sex messing with their intellects
Throws parties every week in his happy home
Out on the island and stays smiling alone
That's his style, macking skins and laying girls like towels

I'm fantastic, true meaning of what bad is
15 years on the scene, could never fall back
A small pack, you're fucking right, I think I'm all that
You know a nigga with a doubt?
You can bring him to my session and watch me take him out
He'll RIP when I rip him and I stick him
In a bodybag then I'm gonna zip him
I'll throw him in the ocean, and watch him sink
Cause he shouldn't waste ink on them rhymes wasting time
Cause them rhymes stink
Mikey D's reanimated and these other rappers hate it
I got skills, they can't fade it
I keep the soul cause I'm a lyrical pro

Now I'm a flip the track and bring you back to reality
I'm like Wesley Snipes, I act without a salary
Cause I don't need nobody sayin ""Lights, Camera, Action!""
I act on reaction
Fuck what you see on television
Cause nowadays all of us live in the hellavision
On every single channel it's the same old sane
Brothers' poppin their brain
Or gettin wrecked at a soccer game
Six brothers fallin victim to the street
After mad ? tribe vibes rollin in the black jeep
Every other channel spent its money on the talk shows
From Oprah to Horazo, everybody in New York knows
But when a brother gets real
They make the story opposite
And try to offer niggas raw deals

(Chorus:)
Television tells lies to the vision
The world's a prison
We're livin in hellavision

(Verse 2:)
Every day your lie to me is drama
But not the type of drama that my T.V. shows
Because it makes the drama calmer
When a lady's caught cheatin
She sets with the next man
And doesn't even catch a ass-beatin
Reality check - that's what the T.V. said
Cause in real life it's two to the fuckin head
Samedy Sam fillin bugs with slugs
Wild  is cookin up these deadly drugs
Bart Simpson is cursin up for storm
And children love this shit man, come on
I see kids that say bringin guns to school
Ten year old crack heads and that ain't cool
My four year old daughter curses worse than Bart
Straight from my heart, it's tearin me apart
(Chorus)

(Verse 3:)
And now, hip hop is labeled as a violencer
Like everyone who rhymes packs a gat with the silencer
Every other ? hip hopper goes to prison
Over some dumb shit or for the real life livin
But who's to know what we've been goin through
When all you see is one side of us
The side the T.V. be showing you
You never hear about the stress or the work
Or the hard times we had or hip hop was getting jerked
You only see us in the limelight
But when the night comes, we're always linked to crime, right?
Man - what I've been through is strife
Yo - they could make fifty movies of my motherfuckin life
And there's a million like me
The people you don't see
When you watch your everyday T.V.

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said

'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

So take a look at me now

Look, nobody told me winning hurts,
It's the price you pay, guess that's why I'm feeling worse
Thought I gained the world but really lost everything
Trying to chase my dream had to sacrifice everything
Trying to beat time, missing time, out my son's life
Trying to make up for by buying things that my son likes
It was just a dream for me to be on TV now I'm here
I ain't got no time, my mama barely sees me
My priorities is getting twisted now my world is different
It's been fading day this distant, or
Is it true that I'm really just addicted
To that life, to that life, to the parties and the women
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I just wanted them to listen
I just wanted to go up, wanted fame and the riches
Now I can't slow it down, still going non stop

And see exactly what it takes it takes in life just for you to win
Yeah I'm hustling selfish yeah I must have been
Guess this why I'm lonely, my relationships are suffering
I can have no girl when I'm trying to gain the world
When all she want is time and I ain't giving her my all
What am I supposed to do when friends say I've changed
And my living is so different, my surroundings ain't the same
I'm trying to make up times for that lost time
Try to make it to the top but really loosing more time
Loosing what I used to be, I ain't who I used to be
Staring in the mirror, get acquainted with the newer me
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place

Can't stop you from the game, getting paid is the air you breathe
And every time I try you always turn to me
Say it's do or die, well listen to me, listen to me
Hear the bells ringing, time is running out, whoa, time is running out

I'm hungry and my father ain't been home in days
When it's quiet, I can hear my mama crying
In the sound of her voice that she tired of trying
No food stamps and a stool
The same thing for breakfast is for dinner too
No hope like I'm doing I get a chance

What I'm supposed to do, tell me what my options is

I try to close my eyes I see nightmares
Hearing grown men yelling on the top tier
Feeling like my whole life wasted
My life can't grow behind these cages
Trying to keep hope but I'm loosing it
How the fuck am I supposed to live with tuna fish
Tell me how long can a man ignore
God let them have mercy when I see the board
Cause this is time that I'm never getting back
I want another chance, I need a way out

Ohhh ain't no stopping me now
Got my eyes all on my destiny
Came out the door and now witnessed the best of me
I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left to me
'Cause I'm unstoppable
(Yeah!)
I'm unstoppable
(I'll do good mane)
I'm unstoppable
(I'll think of something else)
I'm unstoppable
(After a while baby)
I'm unstoppable
(They can't stop me)
I'm unstoppable

I believe, yes I, I do believe
Anything I put my mind on I promise to achieve
I put, God help me please get me closer to my dreams
I got all the courage that I need to succeed
They said I wasn't good (no!) and that my writing wasn't lyrical (no!)
They said I wouldn't make it said my action was too criminal (what?)
But now they gotta swallow they're words, I'm unmovable
The picture's clearer 'cause now you're staring at a miracle (yeah!)
But they didn't knew that I would die before I give up
That I'm a fighter, you knock me down, I'm a get up
Giving it my all, 'till I'm gone, no more left
From a freak train I'm coaliting doors to success
Yes!

[Chorus]

Strong and confident (confident) lying hard in this (yeah!)
From the depths of hell look at my accomplishments
I got fists too but I just never give it to 'em (no!)
I hear these haters talking I just never listen to 'em (no!)
I'm unstoppable, fuck it, I convinced myself
So invincible, I was made of something else
It's not a bridge I can't cross, not a road I can't walk (no!)
Not a cell that can hold me (no!), I ain't lost (no!)
Never looking down, always keep my head up at the sky
Baby listen to me you can only fail if you don't try
I'm a champion, spirit of a winner, I'm a rise (yeah!)
I can probably do anything I put that in my mind

[Chorus]

Look at how I feel
Like I'm the man of steel
I'm a call what I would break still
Rolling down the hill
Unstoppable
Still going, failure's never optional
Never back down baby (no!) anything it's possible
Never given up, never fold, never break
Never bow down, still shine on my darkest day
I believe in myself even if you don't agree
I'm living proof that anything can happen if you dream

Where I came from, I ain't supposed to be here
No, but they can't hold me down
I can do it all, now the world is so clear

Máire Brennan,"In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till he returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand",In Christ Alone,

Máire Brennan,"It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out

Well so could anyone

When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to his arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

We'll kiss just as before

At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I see but the Spanish Lady
Washing her feet by candlelight
First she washed them, then she dried them
Over a fire of amber coal
In all my life I ne?er did see
A maid so sweet about the soul

Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay
Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay

As I came back through Dublin City,
At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she tossed it, then she brushed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all my life I ne?er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam

Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay
Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay

As I went back through Dublin City
As the sun began to set
Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
Catching a moth in a golden net
When she saw me, then she fled me
Lifting her petticoat over her knee
In all my life I ne?er did see
A maid so shy as the Spanish Lady

As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps
On velvet backs of avalanches soft
She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft
Which like a blossoming to heaven rise
When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion
Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sun

Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.

When you're fifteen years.

Now when the sky is empty of stars

Breaking through the shadows and the dark
Shining in the night

Now as the day opens wide
Now as the dreams slips away

You wake to the light

Feel as the dark turns to day
Leave the shadows behind
And the dream called in blind
Turn into the light

Máiréad Nesbitt,"Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

But when he come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warm and sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.",Danny Boy,2014

Drowning in a river,
Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river,

In 3 more days Ill leave this town,
And disappear without a trace,
A year from now maybe settle down,
Where no one knows my face,

I wish that I could hold you,
One more time to ease the pain,
But my times run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again,

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here,
You'll save me from drowning,

Maissa,"Un jour au carrefour
De la lune et la Grande Ours
Deux masses titanesques
s'affrontent de toute leur force
Pour nous les gens d’en-bas
On dit que le ciel s’assombrit
Un grand bruit retentit
Car chaque action a son prix
Les fruits de cette collision
Se précipitent vers le sol
Chacun choisit sa cible
De longues cordes de violoncelle
Qui tonnent, tombent et vrombissent
Suivant la force du Souffle
Et l’ombre de l’ondée
Piétine les pays d’en-dessous
Pouce après pouce
Elles couvrent et recouvrent tout
Un céleste allaitement
C’est comme la louve pour le louveteau
Car tous on dépend de cette matière nourricière
Les hommes, les plantes
Nos fermes et nos rizières
Tous les êtres de la forêt
N’étaient qu’une petite pousse hier
L’eau est à la gouttelette
Ce que la terre est à la poussière
Car si elles disparaissent 
Il ne faut pas croire qu’elles se meurent
Elles s’en retournent vers le ciel
Comme Jésus-Christ en sa demeure

Man wooy na la borom Touba
(Louangeons le fondateur de la ville de Touba)
Hila lahòo Fall!
Man beugue na léen wòolu na léen (2x)
(Qu'il soit ici vénéré et respecté)
Wòolu na léen siyaaré na léen
(Et devant qui nous nous inclinons avec piété)
Hila lahòo Fall!
Man beugue na léen wòolu na léen (2x)
(Qu'il soit ici vénéré et respecté)

C’est le cycle de l’eau
Et le siècle de l’or bleu
Tous on appréhende le jour
Où le ciel ne pleure plus
Où les nuages et la brise
Nous retirent leur appui
Et qu’on passe l’après-midi
Au musée du parapluie


Avant que ne disparaissent
Chacun des glaciers de la Terre
Il faut vraiment arrêter d’être
Des gens silencieux comme la carpe
Si t'es anxieux
Je te tends la main les métacarpes
On a besoin de Superman
je t'en conjure mets ta cape
Vas-y et propage
Le message comme des prêtres-moines
Celui de la sauvegarde
De nos rivages et du patrimoine
Les voisins d’en-dessous
Lorgnent nos kilowatt / heure
Ça fait longtemps qu’ils demandent :
« Mais c’est à qui le water? »
Il faut bien comprendre
Les enjeux de la nouvelle ère
Où nos lacs et nos rivières
De plus en plus prennent de la valeur
Il faut en prendre soin
Comme on traite sa propre mère
Car tous proviennent de l’eau

Maite Kelly,"Halb zu Lieben war niemals deins
Halber Mut machte dich nicht klein
Halbe Träume und halbes Glück
War nie dein Ding und schautest nie zurück
An harten Tagen dich nie gescheut
Halbe Fragen ausgeräumt
Und du gabst immer dein letztes Hemd
Keine Frage du bist ein Herzensmensch
Du verdienst nur das Beste, weil du das Beste bist

Du bist ein Held, du bist ein Held
Einer der niemals fällt
Ein starkes Herz, ein Löwenherz
Jemand der weißt, was zählt
Du bist der Mensch der diese Welt
Mit seinem Mut zusammenhält
Du bist ein Held, du bist ein Held, in dieser Welt

Maite Kelly,"Du, du entzündest mich ganz und gar
Alles in mir glasklar, ich funkel und ich leuchte
Oh du
Du gibst mir die Kraft zurück
Trag' dimensionales Glück
Durch Ströme und ich träume
Auch wenn es dunkel wird

Hell wie ein Kristall, wie ein Kristall, überall
Wir leuchten hell wie ein Kristall, jedes Mal, dreidimensional
Und wir explodieren in tausend Farben

Wir leuchten in der Nacht wie tausend Sterne
Wir leuchten Hell wie ein Kristall, wie ein Kristall

Maite Kelly,"Das ich sowas mach, hätt' ich nie gedacht
Doch jetzt stehst du da, nichts ist wie es war
Niemals sagte ich, niemals ich doch nicht
Niemals wie lächerlich, schließlich kenn' ich dich nicht
Auf einmal ist alles klar

Ich nehm' dich heute Nacht vielleicht bleibst du für immer
Ich nehm' dich heute Nacht vielleicht bleibst du bei mir
Vielleicht ist heute Nacht der Anfang von für immer
Ich will dich heute Nacht in meiner Welt entführen
Ich will die Nacht die ewig hält
Die längsten One-Night-Stand der Welt
Ich will dich heute Nacht und das was Morgen zählt

Tanz mich nicht so an, auch wenn du es kannst
Ich hab dich gewarnt, du warst nicht geplant
Niemals dachte ich, niemals kriegst du mich
Niemals mich doch nicht, ja klar so irrt man sich

Maite Kelly,"Ich weiß, du fühlst dich grad alleine
Deine Welt scheint dir gerade so dunkel und leer
Du glaubst du kommst niemals auf die Beine
Dein Herz war nie so traurig und schwer
Wenn alles in dir zerreißt, ich will nur dass du es weißt

Ich bin da, ich bin da
Wenn du mal am Boden liegst
Ich bin immer für dich, immer für dich da
Auch wenn du Flügel kriegst und zu den Sternen fliegst
Ich bin immer für dich, immer für dich da

Du glaubst dass du dinge nicht mehr klar siehst
Und gerade weißt du weder noch ein und aus
Du hast eine Hand, die dich da raus zieht
Ich sag dir lass es einfach bei mir raus
Und drehst du dich nur im Kreis, ich will nur dass du es weißt

Vielleicht ist für mich keine Option
Nur 'ne andere Endstation
Ich lass die Wände nicht mehr Reden
Nein, ich baue mich auf Stein für Stein
Und mache mich nie wieder klein
Ich werd' mein Leben neu erleben

Von jetzt an werd' ich alles wagen und wenn ich es bereu'
