The Roots,"First of all I’d like to say good evening
And we’re so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
‘Cause that’s just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it’s called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
“We got to somethin’ with these words
It’s happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty”
You see, it’s the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I’m the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I’ll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it forher
She said, “Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it’s really nice
But I know you’re not gonna sing that song”
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I’ll give you a little while longer
‘Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
‘Cause I don’t want you waitin’ till I get to the end of my song
Sayin’, “Oh, yeah, now I remember”
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin’ it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here’s my story

Hm, hm, mm, mm

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mm
You said you’ll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mm, mm

I’m nervous and I’m tremblin’
Waitin’ for you to walk in
I’m tryin’ hard to relax
But I just can’t keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin’
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can’t help actin’ like a child

You’re knockin’ on my door and you’re ringin’ my bell
Hope you’re not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we’re both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mm,
You said you’ll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm, mm,
I’m nervous and I’m tremblin’
Waitin’ for you to walk in
Tryin’ hard to relax
But I just can’t keep still

Mm, hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho, yeah, yeah

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin’ what we’re doin’
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it’ll all be ruined
But we’ve gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let’s just pray
That true love is what we’ve found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I’ll never forget tonight
No, no, I’ll never forget tonight
That’s when you make me feel real, mm, hm
You make me feel real, real good
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa,
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I’ve got to thank your love
‘Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain’t too proud to show it
‘Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I’ll never forget tonight
No, I’ll never forget tonight
‘Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
‘Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar
Uh-uh-uh, pure love
There’s nothin’ phony about it
Uh-uh, pure love
Your love I can’t do without it
Uh-uh-uh, pure love, ooh

I love him, I know it
I ain’t too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain’t too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain’t too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
And I ain’t too proud to show it

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Mm, mm, mm

Thank you
Thank you",Tonight Again,2011
The Roots,"Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind

I though he was important to your heart
Thought I was the icing on your cake
I thought it was going according to the plan
Was that mistake?
Now someone is in love and someone is in liking
Someone’s holding on with, all their mind
And someone’s lefti 'n' go, no kiss goodbye, oh no
And someone is the answer to the question, why

Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind

Don’t get about my time, my shoulder was your savior
Remember how we used to smile through thick and thin
I would never tell you
If I was your mind, you were my parts inside
Your lies can tie our hands, we were free, just you and me, free
You meant so much to me baby, 
Now look around, the room is empty, the room is empty

Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind

The petals from my love’s flower keep falling, falling
And I have ? my heart, stuck of love, I can hear you calling, calling
Say it loud, say ? could ? maybe why it’s so ? tell me
And in my vision, there’s indecision
It’s tormented ?

Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Is that all our love has been
Just a whisper in the wind
Just a whisper in the wind 
Just a whisper in the wind 

Is that all that has been
Is it all that I was to you, tell me the truth
Tell me the truth, I can take it
? it hurts baby, but I’m strong
And I just gone, yes I moved on
Just tell me now, is that all, was that all, was that all, uh, whoa, 
Just a whisper in the wind, your love, your love, wind, yeah.",Whisper in the Wind,2011
The Roots,"I drew a 2 of hearts from a deck of cards
A stock trick from my empty repertoire
Another hopeless story never read at all
I’m better off looking for the end
Where the credits are
It’s a pain living life against the grain
I’m looking back and y’all look the same
Troy, Mark, and little what’s his name
Memory is rerunning it all
It’s the flight of my fall and it’s right on the wall

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you?

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I used to ride the train to the same two stops
And look at the graffiti on the rooftops
Like the same song playing on the jukebox
Joint called “Faded Polaroids In A Shoebox”
Regardless to what the cadence is
It can’t be forgotten like old acquaintances
I realize how depressing of a place it is
And when I notice my reflection whose face it is

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

It’s only human to express the way you really feel
But that same humanity is my Achilles’ heel
A leopard can’t change his spots and never will
So I’m forever ill
Now I can never chill
What’s keeping me from breaking out like Benadryl
When my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
Sometimes it’s as cut and dry as a business deal
You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
But you remember still",I Remember,2011
The Roots,"Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

I’m in the double G, three-piece tux
Screaming dressed to kill
Hope somebody call my bluff
It’s a full house, sipping on a royal flush
Two queens is on my cuffs
Good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time
I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think
How do you find this upper echelon this time
Let’s toast to better days, a beautiful mind, and a flow that never age

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yo, I’m never sleeping like I’m on methamphetamines
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precedes me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies
Holdin' fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers
Rich but never famous
Hustle anonymous still remain nameless
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide right pursuers tried like
To no avail and a heroes what they died like
I’ve got em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
Not in the lime light or needed for the crime right
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line tight

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun
Have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese
Free falling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap for all the years
That we spent in luxuries lap
Without looking back
Cause memories could sting like hornet
Damn it felt good to see people up on it

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine",Kool On,2011
The Roots,"If you can't swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit dis

If you can't swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit dis

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

Smoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka
You pick your poison down Davey Jones' locker
It's rum we be wanting
By the tons my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver
It's disgusting
Take a look at the man in the mirror
We start fussing
Only one person gets hurt when throwing the punches
Me
And the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding water starts receding
A feeling comes into my heart I start believing that
I actually might survive through the evening
Survive my own thoughts of suicide that's competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened
By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning still diving in the deep end
The waters carried me so far you can't reach ‘em
And it feels like there's no one

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

After the love is lost
Friendship dissolves
And even blood is lost
Where did it begin
The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holding my breath
Now I am better off
There without a trace
And you in my head
All the halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done till you dead and gone
The grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to lo and behold the soul keeper
I'm not even breaking out in a sweat
Or cold fever but
I'm never paying up on my debt or tolls either
I'll leave the memories here I won't need 'em
If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom
Your body's part of the Maritime museum
Face down in the past is where I'm bein'

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

If you can't swizzim then ya bound to drizzown

The Roots,"I did it all for the money, Lord
It's what it seems..
Well, in the world of night terrors it's
Hard to dream, they hollerin' cash rules everything
Just call it cream, cause when it rises to the top
You get the finer things
Oceanfronts, rolling blunts with model chicks
And saying grace over lobster and steak
Like please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes
I'd give it all for peace of mind, for Heaven's sake
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
Cause everything that wasn't for me I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
They told me at the end
Don't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my)
Make my (make my)
Departure from the world

Tryin' to control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And my splaying got me praying like a mantis
I begin to vanish
Feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplating that special dedication
To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven I can't find a stairway

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
They told me at the end
Don't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my)
Make my (make my)
Departure from the world",Make My,2011
The Roots,"Yo, the spirit in the sky scream homicide
But it was time to ride on some niggas funny talking
If too much money talking
We make em economize
Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a
Kam-I-Ka-Ze pilot
We wilin' out of control until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con
Feared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y’all streets
Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best
I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away
I wish a nigga could
Listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest
But once you’ve had the best better ain’t as good
Weak heartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like the samurai
The street’s Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck
I’ve been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it’s a smash and grab
And where my party people y’all finna have a blast
You say goodbye, I say hello first and last
Hello hello, Now all of y’all elevate your glass
To an example of what time will do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects-usual, coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time
Then I went missing looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line un-rhymed

You ever wonder what’s the big fuss
For everyone be on time
What’s the big deal, why do they feel
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky and if I’d ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

I wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then drive in head first like the jack knife
Cause out here, yo you niggas can’t belly flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
One time means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one time
The pendulum swinging my way, couldn’t be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
Cause we all going down just like the sub prime
Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Then through the alley way and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets
A life of high crime
To make it to the bottom
Such a high climb

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world",One Time,2011
The Roots,"Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to hell I’m gonna make an entrance
Yeah let em know I’m getting cheese like omelets is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas'

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying cold blood hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he’s tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to breaking the law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking of how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose
Get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side

The Roots,"Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I’m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
It’s unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here

The Roots,"It’s about flesh and blood
It’s about a heart beat that beats strong
It’s about s passion
That is unyielding
And I want you men to know today
It’s your time
It is your hour
It is your moment
Go take it

Yeah speaking of pieces of a man
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter I’m leaving for my fam' but
It’s written in language they will never understand
A late repentant
Never deviating from a plan
I drive by headed for the valley of the damned
The wheels spin, I’m looking for a sacrificial lamb
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan
Listen
Was this a matter of flesh and blood
Yes it was
Does it matter who win and lose
Yes it does
It ain’t about the most blessed love
When you return to the essence
What is it back to the essence of
Greatness I wasn't in the presence of
Cause you was fake and never measured up
You just a nigga on his regular
But how far am I ahead of ya
It just as easily could'a been me instead of ya

We gone fight till we can’t fight no more
You can't fight no more
You gone lie down and bleed a while
You gone get up
And fight some more
Want you say it with me
Repeat it after me when I say it
We gone fight

Fuck getting fucked
Immaculate conception
Now what’s beef ain’t even a question
Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape
Flirt with death every night it’s a blind date
One night stand paybacks a bitch
Shit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss
Blood sweat and tears broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth
Blow the devil a kiss
Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat
Daddy should’ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets
I’m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail
Kick in the door like welcome to my world
I’m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
Half of the time I'ma keep it one hundred
Don’t play chicken when I’m driving them crazy
Get hit in the wing thigh breast or drumstick

Rob Peter to pay Paul

That consumes its own dreams like I’m a cannibal
I won’t accept failure unless it’s mechanical
But still the alcohol mixed with the botanical
I guess I be referred to the owners manual full of loaners
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets with 8th grade diplomas
And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus
Look, let he without sin live without sin

The Roots,"Will you walk us uptown
And wherever you go
You know we will follow
Will you walk us uptown
And we'll stand in the light
Of your new killing ground
And we won't make a sound

Except to sing our sorrow
Will you walk us uptown
While our tears run in torrents
To suffer in silence
Or pray for some solace

Will you wash away our sins
In the cross-fire
And cross-currents
As you uncross your fingers
And take out some insurance

No matter what the price
It's your own paradise
Will you walk us uptown
Will you walk us uptown

Some hearts are sinking &
Some hearts are a-flutter
Some scoop gold
From the dirt in the gutter
Or swallow the earth
Pouring into your mouth
As they bury us upright saying
""Everything's alright""

Will you walk us uptown
Like some said you could
We will feat on your flesh
And drink down your blood
Will you haul down that flag
And dishonor that vow
Cos we must not change
It's color now
Will you walk us uptown

No matter what the price
Each crushed in the corner
Of their own paradise
Will you walk us uptown
Will you walk us uptown

That's always assuming
That you're partly divine
And partly human
Your the king of our hearts
Your the clown with the drum
Will you walk us uptown
If we promise not to run

Will you walk us uptown
Will you gather us near
As cowards flee
And traitors sneer
Keep a red flag flying
Keep a blue flag as well
And a white flag in case
It all goes to hell",Walk Us UPTOWN,2013
The Roots,"She's pulling out the pin
That lets her hair fall down
She's pulling out the pin
She shakes her head
And it goes tumbling

Her smile was out of place
So she swept it off her face

Let me find the words and say them
Like some softly whispered ""Amen""

But she starts to pull away
And the lights begin to dim
Is she thinking of me?
Or is she thinking of him?
She's pulling out the pin…

She's slipping off the hook
Unbuttoning her dress
She's slipping off the hook
There's just enough to make some man a mess
She tears away the veil
With her fingernails

She came out high and kicking
While the band played ""Hey, Good Looking""
Do you hear something ticking?

Did somebody tell her she could really be redeemed?
And could she actually be as desperate as she seems?
She's tearing at the seams
She's going to extremes
Nobody told her it was a sin
So she's pulling out the pin

She's taping up her hands just like a boxer will
And they started laughing
But if looks could kill
She'd take them down right now
She's covering her mouth
With some unholy vow
There's nothing more to say
This is her wedding day

Full of shattered glass and mayhem
Not some softly whispered ""Amen""

While the shock announcement dawns
And the smoke begins to thin
Where the world without ends
And the next one begins

I could let you loose

These five minutes with you

They opened the door and they threw me through
And down I went down, like the twist of a screw
Down into the silver, above me the blue
And you stood there waiting but you never knew

They can scatter the earth and find nothing of worth
Wipe out those years of triangular tears
The colors will fly

Sprinkling gunpowder
Seems that everything is about to blow

With a waxen taper

And they're gathering flowers
In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go
Watching the pipeline as it overflowed
Sitting pretty here on Viceroy's Row

He made a fortune out of barbed wire
In the last days of the Empire
Built a cast-iron curtain
Just to keep control

He was a tycoon, then a cheapskate
Went out looking for a keepsake
To tuck into his suitcase on Viceroy's Row

And they're gathering flowers
In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go
Watching the pipeline as it overflowed
Sitting pretty here on Viceroy's Row

He had a satchel full of cash
And dishes full of ashes
He went from boom to bust
In the blinking of a lash

Shooting out the lights up on Viceroy's Row

She doesn't want her hand held
Walking through a minefield
Saying ""How does this feel?""
Stepping on the quicksand
Going down slow
Hiding up here on Viceroy's Row

Nothing satisfies
The ruins of his blue eyes
Like blood stains on a diamond mine
And deep within you felt
Not one measure of his guilt
Staring in the dark up on Viceroy's Row

Yet her penitent lover
Took a ribbon of rubber
Tied her to the bed made of silken thread

But without an ounce of mercy
They denounced him with a curse
Hammering on the door upon Viceroy's Row

Now his little concubine in her cemetery drag
Her face all smeared with charcoal
Is leaving all her cares, so

 I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child
 The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived
 They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived
And they were surprised to see us
 So they greeted us with palms
 They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms

Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
With a slap or a kiss
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this

 I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
 I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
 And everything that I thought fanciful or mocked as too extreme
 Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
 And I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
 And if I hold my hand outstretched
 A little bird comes to me

 And I might recite a small prayer
 If I ever said them
 I lay down on an iron frame
 And found myself in Bedlam
 Stepping on the fingers that were stretching through the bars
 Wailing echoes down the corridors

 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
With a slap or a kiss
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this

 They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a Mustang
 They drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
 They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
 They dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine

 Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
 Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces

My thoughts returned to vengeance but I put up no resistance
 Though I seemed a long way from my home
 It really was no distance

 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
With a slap or a kiss
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this

 And the player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
 The Ringtone rang out ""Jerusalem""
 Into the pit of sadness
 Where the wretched plunge
 We've buried all the Innocents
 We must bury revenge

 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this
There must be something better than this
There must be something better than this

Gravedigger, dig a hole that fit a black nigga
My body's stiff as a Madame Tussaud's wax figure
My transformation: a caterpillar from crack
Dealer and back peddler was no less, than spectacular
Yeah I was trappin' money, flippin' like a spatula
Now put that sucker in a box like Dracula
I let the devil in to dance
An electric slide across the line I drew in the sand
Dead, ended
Love is like a harlequin's romance
Lost between sips of liquor, that empty bottle in my hands
It was a shot away, but I never got away
Dreamed a little dream of me, but that was an anomaly

Holy, Sugar, Honey, Ice Tea
I guess that's a prayer for a player like me
In my church clothes bakin' buzz on the bible
The sweet temptation of my grand daddy's rifle
Got me thinking 'bout doing a jihad with these guys
Who only True Religion look better than Levi's
Who baptize glasses with beers and blood stain
You breathing to the choir, that prayer's the drug game
Hallelujah
'Til the cops cough me in the back of a cruiser
Or the fire truck wash my soul down the sewer
I count my blessings and blow it on a nun to resurrect my erection
I pray, I pray, all thoughts go to heaven
Or to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection
So I can pay for my sins on PayPal
Or own a holy ghost, a greyhound

Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

All my soldiers, what's good? We need to rise up
We ain't got no other choice, we need to rise up

Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'

Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden
Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen
Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and
Before I ride in a hearse and
My breathing stops and you'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth
And now I kill again on that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan
Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington
Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in
Wonder where Busta been, feelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win
See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment
To rise up again, that's the way I was molded
And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'
Give me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it

You ever see a painting by John Trumbull?
Founding fathers in a line, looking all humble
Patiently waiting to sign a declaration and start a nation
No sign of disagreement, not one grumble
The reality is messier and richer, kids
The reality is not a pretty picture, kids
Every cabinet meeting is a full on rumble

My mind flashes, I see the asses of the masters
Who test the masses, I ask if I'll ever be one
When I die, will heaven be done?
What will my legend become?
I will forever be young
Through old tales of breakdancing down at Odell's
Streets named after me is where my soul dwells
Desires of a church choir, Trinity United
I think of good memories that Hennessy provided

Memories divided by perception
Will it be water for chocolate or resurrection?
The path to perfection is rarely achieved
I head in that direction, I dream and believe
An underground dude that overachieve
From the windy city I was blowing they eaves
Somewhere along the way I aired out MCs (who lives who dies who tells your story)
But to stand out some days you may freeze

And who dies
Who holds on to all our lives
Time and time and time again
Will they tell your story in the end

Yo, the anticipation arose as time froze
The black men in the morgue were John Does
Lynched for whistling at blond-oes
I said a prayer with my eyes closed
As I loaded the roscoe's at the sink, yo
I been a bullet on the brink
But being a young king
Probably different than you think, though
The quills that I dip into the ink go to document
And you'll remember me when I'm extinct

Yo, sing the carol at a young pharaoh
Who slew Leviathan with one arrow
As I revolve through the gun barrel just to watch it unravel
I tell them have heart, must travel
Keep my legacy alive even if I don't survive 'til the curtain call
First of all, realize what we working towards
Fuck around, find what we searching for (who lives who dies who tells your story?)
The earth, my name written in cursive on

Reserve note your money with a hip hop quote
I might change legislation with some shit that I wrote
From boats that we came on to lights with our name on
Through hard times, we spark minds to keep the flame on
I write hard rhymes like I'm running out of time
Truthfully, my stop watch is one with the divine
Centuries from now, they'll play my freestyle
And say, this is the brilliance of a Black American child
Endowed by the streets of the Chi proud
Known to move in silence, but can be loud
The noise of beat girls and boys
Building to destroy the perception of urban aggression
My life is a progression, of course for the oppressors
A chorus, my story is the glory of the lord

""You'll Be Back"" from the hit musical, Hamilton 
Now obviously I'm not a Broadway star, but I am 
Classically trained, and by that I mean I was trained 
By vocal coach, Ed Classically
Who actually, ""Classic-alley"" is another pronunciation
He works out of his mother's basement in New Jersey
And he has a breathing technique that I use
And that's the way I'll be able to hit these 
High notes and these long, powerful, belting chords 
So, hopefully you enjoy, here's ""You'll Be Back""

You say
The price of my love’s not the price that you’re willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea as you see me go by

You say
The price of my love’s not the price that you’re willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you’re making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I’m your man

You’ll be back, soon you’ll see
You’ll remember you belong to me
You’ll be back, time will tell
You’ll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

You say your love is draining and you can’t go on
You’ll be the one complaining when I am gone
And no, don’t change the subject
'Cause you’re my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

You’ll be back like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love, for your praise
And I’ll love you till my dying days
When you’re gone, I’ll go mad
So don’t throw away this thing we had
'Cause when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love

Free

People swear they won't but they're walking in their sleep
I pray the Lord their souls to keep
Because wolves disguised as sheep patrol our streets
And we all know that what you sow, you shall reap
Those who do know, you should teach
Through every loophole, we gon' leap until you reach
A common ground and become unbound
Because when your whole town becomes a battle ground
Tears weighing down

Because it ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
And it ain't there
Or try to read what tomorrow holds
When it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
Racial tensions running high
Under 21 is far too young to die
My salvation's under fire
This marks a rising of the tide

Everyday I wear a mask like an umpire
Yes, a nigga gotta laugh to keep from crying
Tonight another friend passed on the young side
It's bad 'cause a good friend's hard to come by
Justice is never color blind, never gun shy
The one crime, you may never see the sun shine
We know of one times, giving you the finger
Round hearing me, fuck you, it's not the number one sign
I hear they turning downtown to the front line
It's something like the same place but it ain't safe
They took it from the human race to a tank chase
The Devil feeding off hate so he gain weight
There's tainted waters in the well, so we can't taste
People dazed and amazed though it ain't grace
Impossible to co-exist in the same space
Enter the black saint with the war paint face

This generation, we've forsaken all that's real
What emotions do we feel?
Is your poison called a pistol or a pill?
Some people say, ""Let Jesus take the wheel""
Others say, ""Thou shall not kill""
But they don't tell me that you ain't gon' pay my bills
We've come so far yet here we are
Ruthless God, presumed inferior
We ain't scared of y'all

It ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
And it ain't there
Or try to read what tomorrow holds
When it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
Racial tensions running high
Under 21 is far too young to die
My salvation's under fire
Rising, and rising ride

Arab, Israeli, Native American Mexicans
Invested in wrestling with Willy Lynch's next to kin
The rising of the tide, noose around the necks again
Look at how they try to hide proof of all inexcellence
The only tag you know me as is Holy Swag
Through any glass window, we smash, and bro we back
It's coming fast, I'm unabashed, so we have
An awareness of the only flag that's growing fast
I guess I'm tryna minimize arrests, I identify with death
That don't mean it's not an uninvited guest
I'm just tryna answer all of my requests
And express in 140 characters or less
Why I'm the best educator, re-legislated, premeditated
Dedicated, heavy weight that ever paid it with blood
Not tuition without a cop's permission
I got a pot to piss in despite the opposition, listen

Oh, it ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
But it ain't there
Try to read what tomorrow holds
And it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
And it ain't fair
No, it ain't there
No, it ain't fair
Looking for justice and it's just us
It ain't fair
There's a riot going on out there
And it ain't fair
When your protector is your predator
It ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
No, it ain't fair

Always a blood bath brooding 'neath my windows

Not too far from the pavement, the cold grey truth

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

The news had come out in the First World War 
The bloody Red Baron was flying once more 
The Allied command ignored all of its men 
And called on Snoopy to do it again. 

Was the night before Christmas, 40 below 
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe 
He spied the Red Baron, fiercely they fought 
With ice on his wings Snoopy knew he was caught. 

Christmas bells those Christmas bells 
Ring out from the land 
Asking peace of all the world 
And good will to man 

The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights 
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight 
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know 
Or was it the bells from the village below. 

Christmas bells those Christmas bells 
Ringing through the land 
Bringing peace to all the world 
And good will to man 

The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine 
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines 
Snoopy was certain that this was the end 
When the Baron cried out, ""Merry Christmas, my friend"" 

The Baron then offered a holiday toast 
And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host 
And then with a roar they were both on their way 
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day.

And everybody hoped that soon the country he would save

And bounced around the countryside from Washington to Maine

Soon Illinois and Tennessee were both within his reach
He won the vote in Oregon but time was growin' thin
And back at the convention hall, the votes were pourin' in



Snoopy smiled his way into the hearts of everyone
But when the votes were counted up, they found he needed one
The winning vote for Snoopy came when a stranger raised his hand

Lonely road to Babylon

Who must leave or surely die

I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

How I miss her now In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

I climbed where he couldn't see
I smoked my first and last cigarette
And i turned john deere green

When he caught me he just laughed
And said son that won't make you a man

But i knew where i could come to be with things close to his heart

On his long white cadillac
At ten years old he let me steer
Sitting there on his lap
Theres a picture of grandma
That he kept in the dash
An old 8track
His favorite Johnny Cash
In a corner of his tackroom
Underneath his cross
Theres a worn out Holy Bible
The one that saved him when he was lost
It said remember son
You've got to get down on your knees
And thank God for the blessings you receive

Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across

I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous there's no need for fightin'
Suttins tryna hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb

Of your blood
Run within me
And there are red flowers in your spit

Of the drunks in the street
And I can hear when they're playing their lovesong
'Cause the kids
In the yards
Stop playing with their toys

So take me under the scoolyard
There are kids there who got lost
Their mouths all shouting asphalt
And the bodies torn apart
There are colours in the air
When I fall to the ground

But I love the sound
Of your hair when it falls down
From the pillow late at night
On the brink of illusion

Waiting for the moment to kill me inside
How we'd love to die more often

I don't want to see you no more"".

But I know there's someone else out there
That I can go home with
So, my dear, go on home, go home

And if it bites the dust
I guess you're just gonna have to miss my fire.

""I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride""

I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, ""`till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive

I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanitorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side

To clip your ear and steer you clear
Of the funny man in the ice cream van
Who talked so queer

And in my mind I see
Happy, smiling faces if I flog my memory

Play peek-a-boo with Saccharine Sally
Bouncing a ball against a wall
Showing her drawers, ""You come indoors""

I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented
This unprecented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fuse",4th Chamber,1995

Oh unborn child, beginning to grow
Inside your momma but you'll never know

Oh tiny bud, that grows in the womb
Only to be crushed before you can bloom

Stop, turn around, go back, think it over

Think of all the great ones who gave everything

Will you still continue

If you still care about me (Tell me, girl)

I was so 
Insecure with you 
Did you still want me 
So I let go

Were still all mine 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (Show me that you care) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

Must we both 
Go on being confused 
And placing blame 
My heart knows 
That you're my number one 
Do you feel the same way too 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (If you still care) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me

That I still love you 
You're forever on my mind 
And it's so hard to let go 
What I feel for you 
You've blown my mind 

And captured all my love with your sweetness 
And I gave it to you, baby, from my heart

If you still care about me about me 
Tell me (Tell me) 
If you still care about me (Do you feel the same way too)

I feel your presence with me and it doesn't feel right

And then it starts flowing through me
From my feet right to my head
Then I scream calling out your name
I want you back in my bed, my bed

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Like a drummer always beating the insides of my soul
Hidden feelings always seeking
The touch they knew so well in the places that matter

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
I can't eat, I can't sleep, thinking about who you're with
Are you happy making me crazy? You were the best I ever had
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?

The pain of too much pleasure is all so clear to me
After you go nothing but ache to fill my emptiness
Emptiness, emptiness

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?

Still I watch the hourglass
The symbol of our love
When we were so sure
Our love would be everlasting

What changed your mind
We are the sands of time
Only sands of time
Don't ever run out on me

Time is loneliness
When you're not around
But I continue
Turnin' the hourglass upside till I see you

And whatever life brings my way
I'm always gonna know one thing
With you I'll always share all my love
Nothing can change it because we're bound by the sands of time

I won't change my mind
(No, I won't)
We are the sands of time

Only sands of time

I almost hope

Oh, but if you believe
You can make almost anything you ever want come true

In its clear and gentle waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at this moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know 
I was not born to follow

Where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside

There was a world within their brain
That grew from love as summer rain
In their eyes that wandered free",Strangers,1969

I be your face you touch with your hands
If I could be laughter I'd forever surround you
When the colours of the world in your eyes are flashing

I be the tears that flow down your face

We wander barefoot on the sunset sand

Rising at dawn, keep the children warm with his cloak of honey

and the light shines on the water

leave shelter when it's raining

decisions in blueprint
so nervous and deceiving
in concrete these structures
that our small hands
just keep building

through towers and phone lines
connections to each other

I have to go, but I have a lot I want to do

so beautiful to be here and alive

the sun gone without warning
giants without hearts were coming closer
walking through the river
I could only stand and shiver
in an abyss where life once was

our world is getting smaller
while their walls grow taller
spider monkeys cling to falling
trees as the water rises higher
ten thousand years
shall drown

have before

The Samples,"Behind a window with no borders
I cry myself to sleep
And through these shades of mediocrity
I stand alone and weep

And while the mirror reflection shows me
All the things that may pass me by
I choose to stand alone and wonder
If they will pass me before I die

This misery leaves me lonely and it holds me in
This misery is a shell from which behind I grin
And when my feelings cut me down so deep inside
I run with my shield and hide

And while the mirror reflection shows me
All the things that may pass me by
I choose to stand alone and wonder
If they will pass me before I die

This misery moves me on and on and on and on
This misery moves me on and on and on and on

And while the mirror reflection shows me

I choose to stand alone and wonder
If they will pass me before I die, before I die

And if you ever will be free
Gone is knowing how

River flows, no one wonders why
And on the other side, something calls

Counting each and every step before you're home

Now the dark finds you in your room
And another day will be all too soon
And another day will be all too soon

Between the grip of your teeth

So much is happening all around

And absorb the sound

And the stars in your eyes
It's calling me from another world

Think we'll always be able
To live in the colors

Stolen by the one
Who returns holding none

Crashing waves

All my thoughts are of yesterday
You couldn't bring me from them now
Because the story says
All my thoughts are of yesterday
And the sun really burns
Burns me now

In the time when the cup was full
By the sweet crystal mine and all
That she's waiting for is the moon
Which does burn me too

All my thoughts are of yesterday
You couldn't bring them from me now
The story says
All my thoughts are of yesterday
And the sun
Burns me now

In olden times when the story told
Of the grass near the mine
Don't disturb what is growing
Here you can find it on
The other side of night

Snowing cold, why aren't you here for me to hold?
In a dream somewhere finding my way home
Then a change of scene
The rest took place in Ancient Rome

Was I a king?
Pretty ladies all around
I gave one a ring
So satisfied in who we found

Didn't make much sense
But we loved to do our thing
Behind her fence
And behind her little silve ring

That turned to gold That turned to gold

Growing old, watching silver turn to gold
Snowing cold, why aren't you here for me to hold

I'm frozen to my seat 
I lost my sense of time
neglect from God above 
who walks the crooked line

But still we fly it's so streamlined
flying angels to the sun
those wars are never won
I love you on this morning
where the strangest strangers curse
as the buildings tumble down

A free chance for a villain
maybe heroes or a soldier
in all my life as I would stand
United to a flag 
and clenching with my hands

But still we fly it's so streamlined
flying angels to the sun
those wars are never won
I love you on this morning
where the strangest strangers curse
as the buildings tumble down

When in fifty years
may just one forget
was that yesterday 
or just last summer

The Samples,"Growing old, wathing silver turn to gold
Snowing cold, why aren't you here for me to hold?
In a dream somewhere finding my way home
Then a change of scene
The rest took place in Ancient Rome

Was I a king?
Pretty ladies all around
I gave one a ring
So satisfied in who we found

Didn't make much sense
But we loved to do our thing
Behind her fence
And behind her little silve ring

That turned to gold That turned to gold
Growing old, watching silver turn to gold
Snowing cold, why aren't you here for me to hold

And behind her little silver ring

The Samples,"I'm looking for people
That I used to know
And I'm looking for places
We used to go

I'd promise the changes
I'd never change me
No matter how distant
We seemed to be
We used to be children
And I'd never forget
When we played in our circles
But that game's not over yet

The neons too bright
The world's too fast
The cities at night
And the stores behind glass
The streets in the rain
And the field back home
They're never the same
So now I'm alone

I'm looking for people
That I used to know
And I'm looking for places
We used to go
We used to go

We used to go

The Samples,"Another starry night is above us
For the last ten thousand years it's been the same
In a moment's notice 
Not a stone unturned that someone didn't claim
Who am I to be here, who am I to know
All the streets are sinking
Cause the world goes half the speed of what it takes
And the wires lead somewhere
Sending signals to our homes in outer space
Who am I to know this, who am I to dream
From the warmth of being fine
To defending battle lines
In a car on the freeway
Broken down from some new form of gasoline
In the door she's waiting
Living up to every diamond in that ring
Who am I to love you, who am I to care
Another starry night is above us
For the last ten thousand years it's been the same
In a moment's notice
Not a stone unturned that someone didn't claim

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet, the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

In despair, I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

Then pealed the bells, more loud and deep

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

Where there is hatred let me sow love
Where there is injury, pardon
Where there is doubt, faith
Where there is despair, hope
Where there is darkness, light

O divine master grant that I may
not so much seek to be consoled as to console
to be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love
For it is in giving that we receive
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned
And it's in dying that we are born to eternal life

The Saturday Night Live Band,"Searching in the sky one night, while looking for the moon
I viewed a mighty light approching in a zoom
Need was there to tell someone of my discovery
Fifteen seconds later, a light appeared in front of me
To my surprise, there stood a man with age and mystery
His name was Jupiter and came to visit me

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

Keep your eye on Jupiter, such beauty in the sky
We will wait for your return in the by and by
Keep your eye on Jupiter, memories we shall fulfill
Just to view a brighter day, and do a righteous will

Watching and considering my visual state of mind
The flower fragrance help reveal to me the sign
The sigh of love, I had confessed to live and really know
The sign of love which I had failed my fellowman to show

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

Where's the pain when you walk out the door
It doesn't hurt like it used to before
Where's the love that we couldn't ignore
It doesn't kick like a pill anymore
Where's the thrill at the end of our fights
Where's the heat when we turn off the lights

I just miss all the miss that we made
When we still have the passion to hate

I miss missing you, sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears
Begging to get back together
I just want you to be
To be stuck in a second forever

There's a blind force letting it win

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1997
The Sauter-Finegan Orchestra,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

They lead the way to happiness

We drank tequila by the light of the moon

And could make me love her till the end of my days
She lit a candle then she took my hand
And in the street I heard the mariachi band

She started to change I nearly lost my mind
When she said that I'd be her honeybee
I realized she had put a spell on me
I looked around and my eyes grew wider then
I realized I was inside her spider den
Caught in her web I never had a chance

But I say that can happen and it can happen to you

I tried to run but I never had a chance

She had a big big brother who said he'd break all my bones
It didn't matter to me I knew eventually she'd see her big mistake
And come running back to me

Now I know better then I couldn't forget her
I asked her for an answer and she wrote me a letter
Saying it's over forever I hate to burst your bubble

Trouble all around me now I don't feel right
Trouble when I'm breathing when I open my eyes

That he is Parson Brown

When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin' you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no no

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, oh most girls

Most girls want a man with the bling bling

It was Dublin city on a Friday night
With vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night

We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought but never heard
Who would have thought it would end up like this?

But everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong

Before we met
Before our hearts decided it's time to love again

Took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain

Are you hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss
That you would drift on memory bliss
It was Grafton street, on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Who would have thought it would end up like this?

But everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong

Before the worst
Before we met

You healed these scars over time
Embraced my soul
You loved my mind

Only they can see where this is gonna end
But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

We're just trying to find some meaning
In the things that we believe in
But we got some ways to go
Of all of the things that she's ever said

He says he's gonna turn the wheel, turn this shit around
She says if he's looking for love then she don't want to be found

When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's all I've got
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound

This time he's gonna make it to the aftermath
This time she's gonna raise her head choose the righteous path
He said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh
She said better to have and not need, than to need and not have
No matter what the cause it's better to have loved and lost
Have you ever met a man who never loved at all?
Yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall
You have to choose something cuz you can't have it all
No, he's not gonna be the last to the finish line
She said even losers get lucky sometimes
He says it's gonna get better like a fine wine
She says it's harder to smell the roses when the sun don't shine
This time he's gonna find another way
This time she's gonna take you to the good ol'days with no... gracing
Only warm embraces with the two little sweet angels with dirty faces

When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's all I've got
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound

The Script,"To your brother, to your sister, to your misses, to your mister.
To your friends, to your foes, give the love around and back around it goes.
It all comes from the top and it spreads right round
Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down
To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids
Now watchin' mamma cry
And they pick it up, cause they learn everything
Life has a funny way of going in a ring,
End up growing up in trouble with the law
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore
Now it seems that every brand new generation
Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation
Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation
That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)
We gotta change before the train leaves the station
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation it takes blood,sweat, tears, innovation 
It starts with us, it starts with us.

[Chorus]
Yeah, it starts by giving love to your brother,
Giving love to your sister,
Giving love to your misses,
Love to your mister
Giving love to your friends,
Love to your foes,
Give the love around and back around it goes 
Give the love around and back around it goes 
Round it goes, round it goes,
Round it goes goes goes

Give the love around and back around it goes
Oh we're all just folks working in a wheel
Spinning all around life's cruel battlefield
Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day,
Watch it wash away
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away
Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm
Over half a million people die
Oh we don't care because we're all desensitized
We don't realize we're putting all this shit before our children's eyes
Now every brand new generation
Have all been growing up with cracks in their foundation
We're tryna fill a holes of a whole damn nation
That's lost it's trust (that lost it's trust)
We gotta change before the train leaves the station
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation
It takes blood, sweat, tears, innovation
It starts with us, it starts with us.

[Chorus]

Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)
Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)
Love to your friends (around it goes)
To your foes (around it goes)
Give the love around, back around it goes
See the thing about Karma is she loves a bit of drama, yeah
Loves to hunt you down and pay ya back for the things you did
Before you turn a positive to a negative
Better pray before you know exactly who the fuck you're dealing with
This is not a dress rehearsal, let me tell you kid
Whatever you put out there is coming back again
Years may burn (ohh)
Tables gonna turn
Karma's coming back around
Either way you're gonna learn
To give love to your neighbor, love to yourself
It don't matter bout your status
Man your health is your wealth
We can all point a finger but there's four pointing back at yourself
I'll be the bigger man now
Give a little help

[Chorus]

Give the love around back around it goes 
Around it goes (x2)
Give the love around back around it goes 
Around it goes (x4)

You knocked me over

To a kiss just like a whisper
And it takes to kiss
When I knew that you were gone
And you left the motel
When you're headin' off on nowhere
But the lady on the door said
You haven't left that long, long, no

No I, And we don't even know where were going
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)

So she was born to live this way

Tell a sad story, yea tell it from the start
Pass me on the pain that you made into art
Yeah, pierce it through my skin like a heroin dart
When 

Someone strummin' on the strings and they're spittin' things
Everybody's movin' groovin' vibes when the other sings
They gon' kill you with the passion and the soul

While his woman is sayin' cheers to it all

If you bang us out a beat, everybody move along

Sing a rebel song and watch us march along
Won't you come along? (oh, these times are hard)

They play, you listen, that's plenty

 Have you ever loved somebody
 Don't you know just what it's like
 Hurting someone that you're close to
 Have you ever loved all night, all night

 If you hear people talkin' now
 Will you laugh or cry?
 If you cry I'll sympathize with you
 If you laugh I'll die, if you laugh I'll die

 Have you ever loved somebody
 Don't you know just what it's like
 Hurting someone that you're close to
 Have you ever loved all night, all night

 Don't you know just what it's like
 Hurting someone that you're close to
 Have you ever loved all night, all night

The Searchers,"Sometimes a man might wanna cry   
Sometimes a man might wanna die   
He wonders why he's standin' all alone   
It's 'cause he's got no love to call his own     
Sometimes a man feels oh so sad   
Sometimes a man is hurt so bad   
He wonders why he's feelin' sad and cries   
It's 'cause he's got no love to dry his eyes     
He'd give the world to know someone who'd care for him   
He hopes someday someone will share their love with him

The Searchers,"The lights In the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship adrift on the sea
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail

Oh what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more

Come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea",Sea of Heartbreak,1977
The Searchers,"Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again     
When we broke up I still wore a smile   
I told myself you'd only gone for a while   
But in my heart I grinned, I held up my chin   
Because I knew someday we're gonna love again   
Someday we're gonna love again     
Someday we're gonna love again   
Someday we're gonna love again     
I didn't worry 'bout it when you left   
I knew that I could take care of myself   
You wouldn't be gone long and nothin' could go wrong   
Because I knew someday we're gonna love again   
Someday we're gonna love again     
Someday we're gonna love again   
Someday we're gonna love again     
You just told me that your love hasn't changed   
And that's why I'd like to arrange to see you again   
I don't know when but I do know that someday we're gonna love again   
Someday we're gonna love again     
Someday we're gonna love again   
Someday we're gonna love again",Someday We're Gonna Love Again,1977
