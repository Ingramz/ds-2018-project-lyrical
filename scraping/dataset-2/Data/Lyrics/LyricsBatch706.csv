Mecca Normal,"Mother Africa walking along with Stephen Lewis
The dancers are dancing towards the camera
Hips moving real fast

A young woman in a school uniform
Is singing in front of the choir
Singing a song perhaps she wrote
For this occasion this television opportunity
Make no mistake it's directed at you and me.

She sings, ""Why me, why him, why her?
Why me, why him, why her?""

But the real question underlies the theme.
We know you have the drugs
You keep them under lock and key
In the west away from us.
And you choose who lives and dies.
Why him, why her, why me?
Why her, why him, and why do you choose?""

Mother Africa takes off her large lens glasses
And wipes her eyes
Stephen Lewis doesn't look he's going to cry.
He takes the message back
Back to where it's heard.

Why me, why him, why her?
You choose who lives and dies.
Why do you choose who lives,
Who dies?

Who dies?",The Message,2006

Stanotte amore non ho più pensato a te 
Ho aperto gli occhi per guardare intorno a me 
E intorno a me 
Girava il mondo come sempre 

Gira, il mondo gira 
Nello spazio senza fine 
Con gli amori appena nati 
Con gli amori già finiti 
Con la gioia e col dolore 
Della gente come me 

Un mondo 
Soltanto adesso, io ti guardo 
Nel tuo silenzio io mi perdo 
E sono niente accanto a te 

Il mondo 
Non si è fermato mai un momento 
La notte insegue sempre il giorno 
Ed il giorno verrà 
Oh mondo

Non si è fermato mai un momento 
La notte insegue sempre il giorno 
Ed il giorno verrà 

Verrà

All I really want to do is keep it real, keep it real
keep it real, keep it real with you
All you really got to do is keep it real
keep it real, keep it real keep it real with me (x2)

Girl how could you trip on a brother like me
I paid your rent,I bought you food and gave you money to spend
And I'm not the type to throw shit back in your face 
But I paved the way for a brighter day when you had nowhere to stay
And it's kinda sad when your tryin to feel bad
over something you never had 
Keep playing games things ain't the same I think your with another man

chorus (x2)
I can remember back in 93'
I was clocking G's, you was sweating me Ohh I had plenty money
Sex every night we used to flex in the sand 
Sayin I'm the man six times to plan and I don't understand 
I can't wait in line to get my thing with you never had no time
For a brother like me no one can steal you from

chorus (x2)
Suddenly I wake up in the morning find myself alone 
Can't do nothin but think about you baby so what else to do
Being in love, being in love, being in love, being in love baby

Mechanical Cabaret,"I taste like polypropylene, a silicon face with a plastic sheen
I'm a carbonized robot, a synthesis of what is not
The food I eat is electric blue
I only drink sci-fi pink c02
I communicate via binary
I never sleep and I don't have dreams

Are you a user? are you being used? 
Are you a user? are you being used?
Are you the abuser 
Or are you the abused?
Are you a user?

I was contrived from a tube of cum
A flick of the wrist next generation

And then your death, too
Can be pointless and numb",Sterilized,2002
Mechanical Cabaret,"Dedicated to Sam Powell 1982-2001
""Go lightly down your darkened way."" 

In order to gain, I'm taking away 
the only thing that is mine
I have nothing to lose, 
Maybe I'll win this time.

I know there's still color
But I only see with monochrome eyes
I prefer those black and white scenes, because
Everybody lies

I can't take it today, I can't take it today
I can't take it today, But I can take it away

I'm hanging hope on the end of a rope,
I'm drunk, and the words of a boy
Still ring in my ears, after so many years,
What else is there to destroy

I can't take it today, I can't take it today
I can't take it today, But I can take it away

I'm never looking back, there's nothing to subtract.",Subtract,2009
Mechanical Poet,"Lightnings!
The flaring claws
Tight strings
Of typhoon's bows

Whiz, rave, howl
The insatiable storm!
Shrill, laugh, growl
Like demoniac swarm!

Vibrates in the rain
Some dancing people
Reflect in a pane

The wine drips
In highwaymen's lair
The chief keeps
The birth of his heir

Stormchild!
The daughter of thunder and hail
Entwined
Her crying with laughter of gale
Come to us and fly!
Break the glass and try!

Squall of a tearing gush
Winds in a violent rush
A moment of hush

Ha-ha, what a deafening crash!

Bluster and fright
Tumble and bite
Piercing the shower
The bolt set a tower
Alight!

Mechanics,"Time from the man, who will live while he can, on his own
Pass by the dream, it's movie you've seen once before
Tears in the rain, as you wave at the plane
As it climbs through the clouds, to the sun

You are the one, oh, you are the one
You make it all worthwhile, you make it all worthwhile
You are the one, oh, you are the one
You make it all worthwhile, you make it all worthwhile
I see your picture smiling back at me
But I'm afraid of the future, I'm afraid you won't see

Look for the slave, is he trying to wave or to drown?
There at the start, he'll be there when your heart touches down
Drawn to the pain, like a moth to a flame
As he climbs through the clouds, to the sun

You are the one, oh, you are the one
You make it all worthwhile, you make it all worthwhile
You are the one (you are the one)
Oh, you are the one (you're the only one)
You make it all worthwhile (you make it all worthwhile)

I wish that we were starting over
Oh instead of drifting so far apart
 
Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby please tell me that I'm dreaming
I just never want to let you go
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye

But it's enough to make a grown man cry
'Cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers

Just to smile and hold my head up high
Could it be that we belong together

One more try

Mechanics,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be o.k.

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Tutto è cambiato in questi anni
Chi se ne è andato poi ritornerà
Soltanto per separarci
Ho fatto i bagagli per non dimenticare quel posto
Che sembra casa mia, casa mia
Ricordo il sole che sorge
Ricordo il vuoto che dà
Guardare il tempo che scorre
Quando nessuno saprà di noi
Di questo sole che sorge
Non so se piove da te
Guardo il paesaggio che scorre
Tutto poi torna com’è
Com’è che noi non ci sentiamo più?

Faticoso
Ogni sguardo qui è un colpo inesploso
Non capisco perché mi è proibito vederti
Come se fossi lo sposo
Ogni cosa che so non l’ho vista per primo in quegli angoli
Vita sui trampoli
Ovunque mi giri mi vedo in quegli anni
Perso nei sogni e nei calcoli
Di noi, cresciuti col mito dei B-Boy
Cercando di essere meglio di chi ci diceva
“Bro questo è il mio regno e tu non puoi portarci chi vuoi”
Voi non farete mai nulla
Sì voi sarete dimenticati
Voi non sarete mai nulla
Tu sei sparito, c’hai rinnegati
Adesso guarda tutto da capo
Come se poi nulla fosse cambiato
Come se stessimo ancora chiedendo di chiamare casa
La stessa città che c’ha odiato
Mi chiedo perché dopo tutto quel tempo non mi hai richiamato
Alla fine ho trovato la strada nei posti in cui forse non ero mai stato
Vado via

Ricordo il sole che sorge
Ricordo il vuoto che dà
Guardare il tempo che scorre
Quando nessuno saprà di noi

Com’è che noi non ci sentiamo più?",71100,2017
Mecna,"Scusa se sono in ritardo
Io che di solito guardo
Nelle persone la puntualità nel voler tagliare il traguardo
Sei uno sconosciuto fino a quando non ti acclamano
Ci conosciamo da tanto, come compagni di banco
Cerchi dove non ci sto, dove non entro, dove non so
Gli amici che ho perso, i nemici che ho
Le volte che ho vinto, le volte che no
Speravo potessi cambiare l’idea che ormai tu hai di me
Mi muovo nelle acque profonde, risalgo le rapide di lacrime
Ora che sembra quasi impossibile
Rimanere a contare le vittime
In questa guerra nessuno può vincere

Capita a tutti di commettere errori
Farsi fregare, farsi fare fuori
Siamo innamorati pazzi, ma non regaliamo fiori
Non parliamo con chi vuole aiuto, non cerchiamo aiuto
Da chi può rischiare tutto e chi non si è perduto
Siamo in cerca della libertà o solo della droga che ci libera
Per quanto resti effimera
Idolatriamo il passato come se ciò che ci sarà di bello sarà qualcosa che è ritornato
E stiamo in una piazza a dirci cose che non so
Dentro i sabati affollati di “bevi una cosa o no?”
Col timore di restare a casa
Scrolli col pollice la vita degli altri

Mecna,"Per quanto possa ricordarmi
Ho sempre odiato i compleanni
L’attenzione, anche se poi sto sopra a un palco a denudarmi
Quelle storie di beccarsi tutti quanti, boh
Regali un po’ così così che non ho spazio
E dovrei regalarli a qualcun altro
Però lo so che non andrebbe fatto
Ho gusti un po’ difficili
La colpa non è vostra affatto
È che crescendo sto capendo che alla fine dei conti io sono un cagacazzo
Chissà che pensavate quando mi chiudevo in bagno
Poi la fissa dei T-Rex, l’uomo tigre e l’uomo ragno
Certe cose poi non vanno come vuoi
Ti vergogni delle robe che facevi due anni fa
O anche solo fino allo scorso anno
E le ho fumate le canne
Ma ero più bravo, mi pare
Di mia sorella che invece si faceva sgamare
Non puoi lasciare il filtro spento dentro al vaso
È matematico che mamma o pà lo trovino per caso
Dai, sarà che ho dato sempre mille feste a casa
Tipo quei party in cui trovi la fidanzata
Ero al liceo e non mi piaceva stare solo
Che stronzata
Ora se invece dò una festa è con una sola invitata

Capitano a tutti le giornate storte
So che sembro stare altrove a volte
Qui il tempo passa come se stesse volando
Buon compleanno, buon compleanno
Dovrei festeggiare, è quasi mezzanotte
Senza candeline e senza torte
Qui il tempo passa come se stesse volando
Buon compleanno, buon compleanno

Per quanto possa concentrarmi
Odio i compleanni
Perché ti costringono a rispondere al telefono
E pure a sorridere
Ora che siamo tutti un po’ più lontani forse è gestibile
Nel dubbio il mio è spesso iraggiungibile
Poi penso che ho sempre avuto il permesso per suonare in casa fino a tardi
A volte per non perdermi un concerto
Ricordo gli Intercity notte Foggia-Pescara
E non l’avrei detto, suonare prima di Bassi Maestro
Io sempre stato di poche parole
Oh, dico poche ma buone
Credo che in certe situazioni è meglio starsene in silenzio
E non cercarne per forza di nuove
Faccio proprio a meno della compagnia
E credo che io sia normale
Solo chi sta bene solo poi può amare
Sai quanta gente scopa per sentirsi dire ""ti amo""
A volte è l'unico motivo per cui ci cerchiamo

Continuo a odiare i compleanni
E c’ho una faccia in certe foto
Che infatti forse era meglio non farle proprio
Non vi abbraccio, non vi chiamo spesso
E so che è troppo poco su whatsapp dire
“Vi voglio bene, ci sentiamo dopo”
Per come sono fatto è pure tanto
So che per sempre avrò qualcuno a fianco

Guardando bene parrebbe che non ci siamo persi
Da come stiamo messi
Io parlo ancora con lo specchio in questi giorni freschi
Incorniciamo i puzzle senza contare che mancano i pezzi
E a noi non sembra ci interessi, tanto
Non ho capito se restare uguali è meglio di sentirsi dire quanto
Siamo diversi
E in questo mondo in cui ci mandiamo messaggi
Non ci capiamo per un cazzo, se ci pezzi
Fanatici, che fanno a gara per sembrare più simpatici stretti nei loro pantaloni fradici
Con chissà cosa nella testa e mi passano immagini di quando a una festa eravamo fragili
Mi chiedi, ti parlo, ma poi son spariti come il mio amico Carlo
E non so cosa dire se non che un po’ potevi immaginarlo
Anche perché sai tutti quanti prendono strade diverse, porte e traverse
Portoni aperti e serrande chiuse per sempre
Spariscono i whatsapp, l’iPhone non mi prende
Tu non cercarmi al pub, è un po’ che non mi scende
Sto qua con Seife perché invece Alessandro si è trasferito a Londra in un lampo
Ci sono rimasto più male di quando la mia ex mi ha dato un pugno e mi ha detto “Parto”

Oh, non vedo il verde sopra gli alberi, parlami
Non credo si possa cambiare coi miracoli, divinità e tentacoli
Cammino trascindandomi gli ostacoli
Avrei dovuto saltare, sfruttare il consiglio datomi
Le parallele che si inseguono per sempre
Frontali mortali sempre a un incrocio differente
Io diffidente di chi per farcela fa il dissidente
Restare in macchina a fumare senza dirsi niente
Cosa succede se stare su un palco diventa peggio che farsi vedere
Debole, rispolverare ogni tuo demone
Volando insieme a un uragano che stacca le tegole

Guardarmi, chiedere aiuto, io che di aiuto non ne ho bisogno
Sono un particolare nel quadro astratto di questo contesto
Chi prima ce la fa, poi tutti appresso
Schiacciati sotto strati di insicurezza e successo
Come cibi colorati in un sacchetto Tesco
Chissà di che parlate quando state assieme
Chissà come sarebbe se poi mi succede
Scrivo per vedere cosa c’è
Voi avete scritto tutto quanto sui disegni che vi escono dalle cannottiere
Zero like, zero share, zero supporto
Nuove Nike, nuovi Drake, non vi sopporto
Io tra i tuoi amici non so, non mi ci vedrei molto
Sempre con lo zaino per le cicatrici che porto
Gradi di separazione, amici come una prigione
Sentimenti sparsi dentro frasi di consolazione
Montagne russe di stati d’animo e glorie
Per ogni voce che plachi ne avrei di nuove
Cerco il silenzio che non spezzi il silenzio
L’attesa che chiami l’amore eterno
Qui solo se alzi gli occhi c’è il paradiso
Per tutto il resto è quasi un inferno

My regal robes of the forest would be satin, not cotton, not chintz.
I'd command each thing, be it fish or fowl,with a woof and a woof, and a royal

She brings you good news or haven't  you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle, what happened was just this.
The wind began to switch, the house to pitch, and suddenly the hinges started 
to unhitch.
Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing 
for a hitch.
And oh what happen'd was rich.
The house began to pitch,the kitchen took a slitch,it landed on the wicked 
witch in the middle of a ditch.
Which was not a healthy situation for a wicked witch.

So put your head together  you still couldn't find me 
Where I be and how I live is ill

Hey yo  niggas always talkin' bout there shit is real 
""I gotta flex with a Lex in my video"" 
That's what half of these rappers be thinking in every city, yo 

[Kazi] 
Yeah, you want to fight don't ya, you want to bite don't ya? 
The involvement of a new coast is here 
To take your soul, rearrange it with flows 
You're unknown, come across our line, you get blown 
Too many bids, ain't no puttin' together 
Restorin' your body parts, leaving the rest for whatever 

[Madlib] 
You talking bout you want to freestyle, you want to flow 
But your flow be like oil and water, it don't mix 
And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids 

[Madlib] 
Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner 
Cause we on a war path, droppin' math 'cause we only want to 
Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real 

Episode #2: God's Gift 

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass 


Episode #4: Medaphoar and Oh No 

[Chorus: Medaphoar] 
Everyday it's like a level in this game that we live 
Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed 
Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold 

[Medaphoar] 
Straight in all black on the attack be Medaphoar so freeze back 
So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La""

"Medeski, Martin & Wood","She sat on the pavement
As I pulled in the drive
Wearing leopard skin velvet
And shiny black eyes
""She looks like a sleeper""

Said my wife at the time
She had curls like Delilah
And a smile like the sun
She held my poor corpse
Like she'd never be done
And the caption in my mind said
""This is the one""

But I'm strong and I'm disciplined
And I avoided her for years
'Till one night, as usual
With my heart full of tears
A hand touched my back

And she was standing right there
Then I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury
Whispering
Whispering

Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is
How my life was a desert before she came in
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house
The way she curled up quietly on the couch
I can still see her in my mind that way now
Aah I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her

Well time went by quickly
And her confidence grew
And she wanted this and that
And she wanted those too
And she wouldn't shut up
And one day I just blew up
Now she's in the hospital
For the second time
Maybe she'll die
Maybe I'll cry
Therapists would say
""You're in denial""

But love became inconvenient
Love became a literal drag
Very bad for business
I'd be better off a fag
She's a model de sport
That I can't afford
'Cause I'm a practical American
From the Middle-West
And I can piss on a grave
While welcoming guests
If cold's what I am
I'm cold 'till the end
And I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
Now I'm gonna continue walking
In the modern world
Which justifies every egotistical perversion
With scientific talk
And new ways to walk

But I'll remember the religion
She became to me
And the other person I could have been
So for now I'll say so long
I gotta go do wrong
I gotta go do wrong
I felt the luxury
I felt the luxury
I felt the luxury

Naked on your big white horse
With your long hair hangin' down
Lady Godiva, you say you're frightened
And so shy
I hate to bust your bubble but you
Sure picked a funny place to hide

Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' for a place
Where no one wants your body
And nobody knows your face
Lady Godiva, you say you wanna be loved
For what's inside
I donÂ't know much about horses but you
Sure picked a funny place to ride

Every man's just a clutchin' hand
Reachin' out to grab you
Every man's a quiverin' lance
Tryin' hard to stab you - don' let 'em nab you

Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' kind of scared
You showed 'em all your talents
And nobody seems to care

Come to think it over
You may have picked the perfect place to hide

If I'd only come and gone
The way I've always done with summer girls before
Shared one night with you and never reached for more
Then we wouldn't face this long and painful righting of the wrong
If I'd just come and gone

If I hadn't stayed so long
And merely parked my dusty boots outside your door
Tracked no footprints 'cross your polished hardwood floor
If I'd have left you in your doorway smilin' drowsily at the dawn
If I'd just come and gone

Then I'd be on a shinin' silver plane dippin' into Denver
Or a schooner blowin' down The Biscayne Bay
You'd be safely tucked away among the pleasure I'd remember
'Stead of lyin' here beside me fearin' restless thoughts inside me
That might awaken with the breakin' of each new day

If you'd only stopped to read
Cold hard words I carved on other bedroom walls
And heard the mornin' coffee truths I told 'em all
I'd still be on your lips like some unfinished half-remembered song
You'd never have loved me if I'd just come and gone

Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed, Cause all I'm gonna need
Is just a little bit of love from you

And we'll be makin' it natural
Ain't it just about time
That old stuff I was so keen on
I no longer have to lean on
Cause your love's enough to keep me high

Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
I'll trade my stash for just a little bit of cash
To buy a simple golden wedding band

And we'll be makin' it natural
But don't you ask me how
It's been the cause of all my sorrow
But I think I'll start tomorrow
'Cause I sure could use a hit right now

I'm gonna throw it out the window, some day
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain

From the back seat of Cadillac cars, to the floor of men's room bars

They say she's had so many, she gives 'em all numbers not names
I always call her Hun' but she calls me 1001
And Penicillin Penny starts to boogie when the day is done

She's Penicillin Penny and if you ever see her passin' through

I said ""If that's the way you want it, I won't stand in your way""
She's gone and now I'm hearing all the things I didn't say

I didn't take her in my arms and kiss away her tears
I didn't say ""My life don't mean a thing if you ain't here""
I thought of all the many games I'd be free to play
But all I do is listen to the things I didn't say

I didn't say ""Take off your coat, I'll make some coffee and a talk""
I didn't say ""The motorway is such a long and lonely, endless walk""
I said ""Goodbye, good luck and God bless you"", then she walked away
And left me here to live with all the things I didn't say

And now I guess she'll never hear the things I didn't say

",The Things I Didn't Say,2001
Medicine Show,"The mornin' sun touched lightly on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In her white suburban bedroom, in a white suburban town
As she lay there 'neath the covers, dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange and the room went spinnin' round

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let the phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he was off to work, and the kids were off to school
And there were oh so many ways for her to spend her day
She could clean the house for hours, or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked down the shady street screaming all the way

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let that phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she'd climbed when all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsy to the man, who reached and offered her his hand
And led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

At the age of 37, she knew she'd found forever as they rode along through Paris
With the warm wind in her hair

And I remember her on the streets of New York City
As I walked the night needing some place warm to go
As she passed I said ""Hey there's snowflakes on your lashes""
And she laughed and said, ""That isn't snow""

She said, ""they're feathers from a pillow God is shaking in the sky""
And she opened smiling lips to catch a snowflake blowing by
And we both began to laugh and then I looked into her eyes
And it was warm again

But
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

But I remember her as we woke up warm together
In her sunlit room, and she said, ""I'll help you pack""
And she sewed my shirt and I said, ""I'll stay forever""
But she laughed and put some cookies in my sack

And she said ""Leave a trail of cookie crumbs as you walk through the snow
And someday I'll follow after and I'll find you where you go""
And I left her in her doorway but why I'll never know
But I was younger then

So
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

So I gulp my coffee - burn my mouth - grab up my coat and slippin' out
I smear a streak of mustard down my sleeve
And the guy behind the register takes my bread and shakes his head
And looks at me as though I've blown his mind
Hey, I just come here for some coffeeâ?¦hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to

That blue eyed barracuda smiles and tells me she could use some brand new clothes
She grabs my leg and with a wink, asks if I want another drink
She's not the campfire girl you might suppose
But she's so busy tellin' me her troubles I don't think she's got time
For any kind of trouble small as mine

Well I'm stopped here on the corner, when the red faced cop says move along your way
But my nose is cold and my toes are numb, I got no feeling in my thumb
I think I just might stop inside that church and maybe pray
But they pass the plate and they look at me when it turns out that I ain't got a dime
Hey, I just come in here to talk to GODâ?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

So you just curtsey and I'll bow
And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne

Then I'll just take what's left of me
Right back to where it used to be
And you'll go sail your magic carpet, far across the sky

Some pretty Technicolor way it's never been
I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did you girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

The castles that you built so high
Were just too steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine
Were just too rough for you

I wish I could've helped you see
Just one of your sweet childhood dreams
But though I tried I could not make not one of them come true

Furs that are woven of whispering hours
Gone, gone, gone, gone

And she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Whispering hours where do they fly away?

I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

Hanging from a string in my mama's kitchen, back in the hard time days
Was a little ol' stone 'bout the size of an apple, it was smooth and worn and grey
There wasn't much food in my mama's kitchen, so whenever things got tight
Mama boiled up some water, put in the stone and said ""Let's have some soup tonight""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

It had been in the family for a whole lotta years, so we knew it was a nourishing thing
And I remember mama, as she stirred it in the water, and we could all hear her sing
""Its a magical stone and as long as we got it, we'll never have a hungry night
Just add a little love to the wonderful soupstone and everything will be alright""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

So it carried us all through the darkening days, 'til finally the sunshine came
And the soupstone started into gathering dust, but it hung there just the same
And ever since then the food's been plenty, but every now and then I find
That mama in the kitchen with the wonderful soupstone, drifts across my mind

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone

Medina,"Should I drink another drink
See another light
I know that you may think
That I'm a broken little bird in my mind

Cause I'm falling on the floor
I'm climbing up the walls
And every time I get a grip
I seem to lose myself just a little more

'Cause I am here and it eats me up
Well, I love the way it feels
I really shouldn't stay
But I can't give up
The more it hurts, the more I need

It's like an addiction
It's like an addiction

Should I drink another drink
Am I running out of time
Confusion makes me think
This solution is beyond my sorry mind

'Cause I am here and it eats me up
Well, I love the way it feels

I'm imagining the house that we're gonna build
Damn nights carry out on a cloud

I'll tell it like it is
'Cause I don't wanna waste another minute
Let me put it down like this
I've been afraid to say how deep I mean it

Silence is filling me up
I tried so many times to reach you
But nothing is ever enough
Still I'm trynna get through

Cause the distance is filling me
Have this thrills killing me
Caught up in the change of your love

Holding on to memories
Don't wanna be in between
I'm lost without you

I just wanna be in your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

In your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

Silence is filling me up
Feels like I'm drowning in the water
But nothing is ever enough
Am I crossing the border

Cause the distance is filling me
Have this thrills killing me
Caught up in the change of your love

Holding on to memories
Don't wanna be in between
I'm lost without you

I just wanna be in your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

In your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

I just wanna be in your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

In your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

I just wanna be in your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

In your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe",In Your Arms,2010
Medina,"I can never forget
The way you held your arms around me
I guess I have to admit
I was afraid to end up lonely

Can't imagine life without you
Cause I don't wanna have another lover
Yes I adore you
But I won't be coming back

Did it make you feel good to see me hurt
To see me hurting
Happy to see you broke me first
Hey baby do you believe 
You gave me what you thought I deserve
Do you believe you conquered what

Are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely
Baby are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely

How could you forget
I was the one you kept on blaming
You said I made you upset
It wasn't true what you were claiming

And there will be no regrets
This time I think I leave you hanging
No there is no longer you and I you and I
Cause you later ground stranded
So tell me baby

Baby let me, It’s like we’re going speeding, let me, 
We’re going down like feet on dance street 
And what we got is close to nothing, close to nothing.

We shouldn’t give this one a try when all it is sex and I, 
Aware of how this love is in disguised. But I’m so hooked that I’m binded.

I want you. There is no wonder,
Aheeyuy,
Because you're making me wanna change,
You make me open my heart again

It's you and me forever,

You and me forever,
I'm always gonna be right here.
Me and you forever,
I always wanna feel you near.
You and me forever,
And I'm feeling so alive cause we're

I've let you in to make me whole

Four a.m. laid up at the res
Got a call made my heart jump out my chest
My man's got beef at the dance, exits is blocked
Enemies outside with they heat on cop

He's says that if he goes outside
He knows he gone get clapped
My man from way back
Ain't going out like that

He got peoples in the club and his ties is strong
But he know that they can only hold it down for so long
So now he's trapped off and he's calling on me
To come and represent like I'm G.O.D.

Of course I must agree, 'cause this is family
If tables was turned he would do it for me
So now I'm hopping out my bed,
Ready put a nigga never seen 'pon dead

Pull out my heat

Yo check it
It was a friday in the month of may
Around the time when everybody put they game on play
See my girl was out in deesa(?) it was all on me

I figured I would hit the metro on the mad L.D.
Now everybody know what the spring time is about
Players polish up they game cause the shorties be out
I was rocking jew-els and my wears was crisp

My man said there was a jam that I shuould not miss
I hopped in the livery(?) without a moment to spare
and when I rolled up on the function everybody was there
I was catching sexy stares from the shams in the rear

Saw my peers and heads I haven't seen in years
Now I was getting caught up in the nightlife mix
Then I see my main man from my old time clique
""Oh shit, not my nigga Mos Def in the house""

""Oh shit baby-paw, I ain't know you came home""
We talked about that and this and way back since
When I seen a caravan sporting wild dark tints
Its window half cracked and they was crusing slow

And was circling the block like they was po-po
Said I was jibbing with my man so I paid it no mind
That's when the shots rang out from the passenger side
It was a forty-five bark that made us all duck down

Girls was letting out screams as shells hit the ground
I was looking for my man so we both could split
That's when he turned to me and said ""yo Mos I'm hit""
I guess the street life don't leave a nigga alone

Laced up at the party and he just came home
If he survive I know he goin' retaliate
If he don't, they bought theyself a burial plate
Either way situation status on code red
I'm on the horn to tell the fam its on like Con Ed

There's mad shit that she want and mad shit that she need [true dat]
Plus she got some nigga, knocking at her door [Who dis?]

Some crab-ass cat that she messed with before [From where?]
Always acting wild disrespecting my G, [Stop playing..]
I think he gotta go, what's the verdict DC

[DCQ]
Verdict guilty, left hand on the scene
You might be locked down but you're part of the team
If you say gotta go, then that's what he gotta do
Ain't nothing sweet son, yo you know I'm here for you

Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant""
Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit

Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangster ain't doin' it right

Ferme ton bec, ravale tes blagues raciales
Ou dans ton bled, tu t'feras rare comme un black-asiat'

Rien à battre qu'tu sois un brave muslim
Vu qu'un Arabe qui fait du rap, reste un Arabe qui gâte ma black music
Tu t'chies dessus quand c'est la tempête
Donc laisse nos panthères noires, t'aurais du appeler ton album ""Arabian Pampers""

Tu crois réunir les Noirs avec ton ""Noir Désir""?
Mais t'es qu'un demi-leader, comme Harlem Désir
Avec vos différences de langue tous les dix villages
Si les Noirs sont divisés, c'est qu'ils sont divisables

Tu divagues ! J'ai pas besoin qu'on m'accepte chez les macrelles
La pire des négrophobies, moi je l'ai subie au Maghreb
M'appelle pas ""khouya"" : on sait qu'vous êtes racistes
Et aucun Nègre n'oubliera que les Arabes étaient esclavagistes

Parle-moi plutôt de l'esclavage des Noirs eux-mêmes
De tous ces ""Oncles Tom"" qui ont enlevé des âmes humaines
Les premiers négriers étaient vos égaux
J'crois bien qu't'aurais fini comme Samuel Jackson dans ""Django""

Contrôle d'identité entre des frères de blood
C'est pas d'la faute des autres si le monde débloque
La crise identitaire est un problème d'époque
Le communautarisme est le cancer des blocks

C'est chez vous qu'on trouve les traîtres et les gars soumis
Donc entretuez vous avec vos Midi et vos Chalghoumi
Dans une embrouille entre rebeus, faut jamais s'incruster
J'avoue j'suis malheureux : j'aurais dû laisser Nessbeal t'insulter

Un peu de cash sur la table, et les Blacks se calomnient
Nous si on s'clashe, c'est pour mieux s'réunir comme Bachir et Laouni
Y'a pas qu'le sable du Sahara qui nous sépare
Et on sera toujours plus unis que Kery James et Kémi Séba

Nous au moins on a des leaders virils dans nos phases
C'est notre odeur qui fera toujours fantasmer vos femmes
Pas de pitié, alors écoute bien
Vous préférez les lapider, alors elles préfèrent notre coup d'rein

Les bonobos ne pensent qu'à tartiner les beurettes
Ils négligent leurs femmes, excisées à la clé à molette
J'veux pas d'vos rituels, j'évite les unions mixtes
Heureusement que les Arabes ont amené l'Islam aux animistes

Heureusement que le Prophète était un être à part
(Heureusement) Heureusement : Dieu nous protège de vos coutumes d'Arabes
(Heureusement) Normal que tu stagnes
Les ignorants comme toi ont bien vite oublié ce que Bilal a fait pour l'Islam

Contrôle d'identité entre des frères de blood
C'est pas d'la faute des autres si le monde débloque
La crise identitaire est un problème d'époque
Le communautarisme est le cancer des blocks

On n'a plus les yeux en face des trous
Comme sous une cagoule du Ku Klux Klan qui masque le jour
Qui écrit block avec trois ""K""
Qui écrit tess' avec deux ""S""
Doit prendre garde
Rien ne sert de jouer au Beur ou au Blackos fier
D'être plus identitaire que sur la blogosphère
On revendique être gosse d'Afrique
Mais qu'être ethnocentrique c'est être égocentrique
Quand les vieilles victimes deviennent de jeunes auteurs
Porteurs du gène d'Hitler sans être leur géniteur
Quand le poison s'invite dans une blague lambda
La mixité ressemble au mariage de Black Mamba
Des traditions aussi snobinardes
Que celles des apéros sauvages saucisson-pinard
Faussement droit-de-l'hommistes et républicains
Éradiquons le radical qui sommeille en chacun

Médine,"Le bus m'emmène dans la ville d'Hébron
Ancienne cité, à la minorité d'hébreux
Souffleur de verre pour le compte de mon oncle
Mon nom c'est Daoud un arabe au regard ténébreux
Je suis né dans ce genre de nid, tout près du quartier juif en Cisjordanie
Jamais je ne sors la nuit
Pas pas peur du noir, mais par un couvre-feu qu'on me force à suivre
Mon défunt frère est mort l'an passé
Officiellement, pour défaut de laisser-passer
Il voulait faire de mes seize ans un jour exceptionnel
C'était sans compter Tsahal et son excès de zèle
La garde-frontière en charge de son contrôle
À cru drôle d'ouvrir la boîte au couteau commando
Celle qui contenait le keffieh traditionnel
Et qui le soir constituerait le fraternel cadeau
Gâteau vandalisé par les gants de cuir
D'une soldate qui n'avait que l'intention de nuire
Une vexation à laquelle mon frère réplique
Par des insultes et des menaces en langue arabe et en hébraïque
""De quels droits tu crois pouvoir me gâcher la fête
Je ferais de toi ma chèvre si j'avais l'doigt sur la gâchette
Enlève tes sales pattes tout de suite de sur cette écharpe""
Aveuglé par la colère un coup lui échappe
Il lui en fallut pas plus pour que le canon crache le feu
Un triplé d'M16 dans le poitrail qui craque le mieux
Ce furent les derniers mots de mon frère
Et leur sens était dirigé en ma faveur
Alors aujourd'hui à la date anniversaire
Je m'apprête à rendre la pareille à l'adversaire
Qui m'a ôté la compagnie de mon ainé, de mon bien-aimé
M'a pris une large part de mon âme peiné
On me prêtera des intentions politiques
Les médias du monde diront que je suis croyant fanatique
Que j'ai agi programmé par un parti terroriste
Et qu'aussi j'enterre ici tout espoir de paix possible
J'aurais milles raisons de m'ceinturer le torse
Ce qu'a enduré mon peuple dans un sanctuaire de la mort
Ces blocus, mépris, obus, phosphore blanc occulte, bouscules, l'ONU qui fait semblant
Interdiction d'accès à certaines professions
Et sur ta carte d’identité, on y appose ta confession
C'est donc ça la seule démocratie du Proche-Orient
Agir en toute impunité sans qu'on lui reproche rien
Mais ma vengeance n'est que personnelle
Lorsqu'on arrive près du checkpoint et des criminels
Dans le bus, dix personnes tout au plus
Un enfant étrange qui vient de monter semble perdu
Ses yeux me fixent avec insistance
J'ai la drôle impression qu'il cherche assistance
Mais mon pouce a déjà enfoncé le bouton rouge
C'est ici que se rencontrent David et Daoud

Le monde un échéquier où règne les rois
Où les pions noirs ont toujours un coup de retard
Mais les porteurs d'eau savent aussi gérer les puits
Les écoles s'remplissent même si les cerveaux fuient
Notre histoire est lucide le berceau de l'humanité c'est le tombeau de Lucy
On change une famine en grève de la faim
Si le mendiant opère c'est pour faire don de la main
Lève les deux poings, Africain fier
Car les endettés d'hier seront les rentiers de demain

Et détruiront les prisons de Libreville
En Amazigh ou en Swahili

Quelque part entre les sixties et l'an 2013
Mon premier concert, c'était Johnny Clegg
Dans les bras d'mon père, j'voyais la mort de l'Apartheid
À l'école c'était flûte-à-bec
Poème à haute voix, dur pour qui fut un bègue
Toujours derrière à la chorale scolaire
Un gosse gospeleur qui couvre une grosse colère
On a grandi avec la musique
Aujourd'hui j'affirme que la musique fait grandir
Pas une manif' sans une chanson
Pas de révolution sans sa bande son
On bat la mesure au rythme des casseurs de pierre
Aux cheminots des chemins d'fer en cadence d'enfer
De Sidney Poitier à T-Pain
J'écris des vers à moitié vides, pour les têtes à moitié pleines
Mes leçons, j'les récitais en rimes à l'oral du bac
Avant de devenir rappeur d'humeur pastorale
Quand ils chantaient des comptines, je rappais les cantiques
Au son des bagnards frappant les tables de cantine
Marchand de réveils, parmi les vendeurs de rêves
Élève le level au travail d'orfèvre
Comme l'étoile hollywoodienne du boxeur au prénom d'prophète

La musique arme les hommes non armés
Se propage plus vite que le mélanome de Bob Marley
Autant d'guerres menées à la guitare Gibson
Ont contribué à changer l'monde, de Paname à Kingston
Aussi vrai qu'sans plage, la vague n'est rien
Les plages de mon disque n'auront rien de wagnérien
Combien de poésies se changèrent en pamphlets?
Combien de concerts firent aux puissants se sentir en danger?
Nos ancêtres sifflotaient en piétinant
Notre histoire est dans la poussière remuée, par des pieds d'Kenyans
Musicalement, douleur ou ricaillement
Mon son redonne à la banlieue les couleurs des îles Caïmans
On s'détend en frappant des peaux de cuir tendues
Raconte nos problèmes graves aux sons des cuivres aigüs
Des chants d'esclaves aux chants des stades

Aujourd'hui le mot ""mature"" tu peux plus le googliser
Accent normand sur langue de Molière j'suis pas normalien
Comme un Algérien du Sud qui s'revendiquerait Nord-Malien
J'suis pas reptilien, un animal à sang-froid
""Je ne mentirai pas au public"" tu copieras ça 100 fois
Dans les années nonantes, MC, c'est l'année du Wu-Tang
J'louche sur la terre de Motown dans les nuages comme Hakim Olajuwon
On passe du lobby au rooftop, Sal's, Médine, et puis Rudolphe
On parle du futur mais ne veut pas mal vieillir comme le Futuroscope
Une dernière fois, j'aimerais voir l'game, avec mes yeux de rookie
Ceux de l'époque de Rockin', sans l'hématome de Rocky
J'arrêterais de croire que la musique passe après l'financier
Que sauver ma carrière fait partie d'un plan pour sauver l'humanité
20 ans plus tard j'ai comme une gueule de bois idéologique
Car avoir une Rolex à 30 ans c'est réussir sa vie
La dernière question existentielle que le Rap m'a vraiment posé
""Pourquoi les boîtes de pizzas sont-elles carrées?""
Ce serait marrant de jouer au jeu des sept erreurs
Entre le Médine que je suis devenu et le Global de la première heure
Numéro 1, j'suis passé du fauteuil de Newton en rotin
Au sofa d'Soral à jouer les penseurs de Rodin
J'grossis l'trait, mais pour certains ça ressemblait à ça
Assez pour qu'on s'fâche et qu'on se dise qu'on s'reverra ASAP
Avec le coeur de ma oumma parfois j'fais du hula-hoop
Plongé dans mes recherches j'ai oublié d'relever le nez de la loupe
Number two, faut que j'arrête de jouer au cyberactiviste
En leur répondant sur le Web j'donne de la force à mes ennemis
Numéro 3, y a pas qu'la lutte sociale dans le Rap
Même Renaud embrasse les flics quand le peuple embrasse leurs matraques
Que des artistes en carton-pâte, et ça m'amène au numéro 4
Quand on n'sait pas à quel jeu on joue
Comment savoir quelle carte abattre?
Dans leurs parties de poker menteur, j'suis qu'un accident de l'histoire
J'ai pris les patins de ceux qui voulait se servir de moi comme d'une patinoire
Cinquième, j'ai souvent servi de bonne poire, de dindon
En parlant de mes figures favorites comme dans une fan-fiction
Faire des cadeaux, s'mettre en porte-à-faux pour des journalistes
C'est comme offrir des bracelets électroniques à des braqueurs d'bijouteries
Erreur 6, avec tes frères joue pas les exorcistes
Chacun son itinéraire dans le din, chacun sa ""to-do list""
Et même si tu penses que la culture c'est l'avenir de nos mômes
Le fais pas au point de transformer la mosquée en fanzone
Et pour la 7, entre la Trap et le Boom Bap garde le plaisir
Entre l'hardcore et le conscient j'ai fait le choix de ne jamais choisir
Mon meilleur album c'est, celui qui n'est pas encore sorti
Et big up à mon brother Wilfried qui m'a soufflé le titre ""Prose Elite""

À force d'aller au fond des choses on s'y perd
Frère
J'aurais du écouter mon père

Tout vient de l'enfance comme Hodor
Mais j'suis comme la fleur
L'homme qui m'écrase aura ma bonne odeur
Tu veux savoir c'qui m'effraie?
C'est pas c'que j'ignore
Mais tout c'que je sais qui n'est pas vrai
Parler de changement
Autant parler de cinéma
À des caméras de surveillance
Souvent j'ai des embrouilles
Avec tout c'qui m'ressemble
Mais l'arbre que la hache coupe
À la même bois que son manche
Passe me voir au quartier
Viens, avec tes idées
Tu repartiras avec les miennes
Moi je n'suis qu'une chaise roulante
Qui a besoin d'une chaise roulante
Je n'ai d'existence
Que dans les oreilles de ceux qui m'accordent audience
Alors à ceux qui crient mes refrains

Vivait un guerrier qu'on appelait Ataï
Cultivateur de banian et d’igname
Chef Komalé du peuple des Kanak
On reconnaît son titre malgré son jeune âge
Dans le respect des coutumes ancestrales
Gardien d'une quelque cinquantaine de cases
Au Nord de Nouméa, la capitale
Au contact des missionnaires, il apprend à parler le français
Une éducation complémentaire de celle dispensée par un sorcier
Apprendre à manier la fronde, dans la nature, se fondre, devenir une ombre
Bien entretenir les tombes
Sur ce qu'on appelle maintenant ""la terre des colons"" (la terre des colons)
Ils veulent nous faire croire qu'ils sont ici pour l'amour de la croix
Pourquoi nous repoussent-ils de nos forêts moites
Si ce n'est pour le commerce du bois?
Ils sont arrivés ici avec leur bétail
Pour y construire des prisons et des bagnes
En pensant que nous étions des cannibales
Installé partout des postes de gendarmes
Ils ont fait de nos femmes leurs femmes de ménage
Dans l'meilleur des cas quand elles ne servent pas d'esclaves
Refusent de nous les rendre quand on les réclame
C'est ce qui arriva à la dénommée Katia

On a tous attendu son retour mais le maître la séquestre
Quand un membre est amputé au groupe, c'est tout le village qui s’inquiète
Sortez les casse-têtes, aiguisez les sagaies
Mélanésiens, enduisez vos corps de la suie de bancoulier
Le sang va couler (le sang va couler)

Un raid de deux-trois personnes, Ataï et deux autres hommes
Au secours d'une autochtone entre les griffes de ce Caldoche
Une fois dans le corps de ferme, ils croisent des bêtes à corne
Ceux qui piétinent leurs ancêtres avec leurs sabots venus d'Europe
Une cheminée qui fume, ils passent la clôture
Ataï n'hésite plus, il garde en tête l'honneur de sa tribu
Fracture la porte de son corps à demi-nu
Étouffe le feu pour que la lumière diminue
Ne s'éclaire qu'à la lueur d'une demi-lune
Engage le combat en moins d'une minute
Maître colon de la Calédonie, tenant un sabre de gendarmerie
Déterminé à bien garder la fille
Qui lui sert d'esclave sexuelle toutes les nuits
Tranche l'atmosphère de sa lame émoussée
Frappe vers Ataï des coups désordonnés
Mais le Kanak se déplace comme vole la roussette
Le combat rapproché, c'est sa grande recette
Coup de silex sur le haut d'la tête
La machette s'encastre dans le cortex
Le maître tombe à terre de tout son être
Et Ataï emmène la jeune fille sous son aile (sous son aile)
Il laissera les flammes faire le reste
Un feu si grand qu'il touche le ciel
Mais la riposte viendra de l'Est
Plus vite que ne le pense le chef
Son absence a laissé son village sans protection (sans protection)
Au loin, les détonations de fusils à piston (fusils à piston)
Ses plantes de pied accélèrent sur le sentier pierreux
Il voit son village et les soldats qui les forcent à sortir de chez eux
Abandonne le groupe, fonce dans brousse
Accourt pour mieux pouvoir briser leurs croupes
Tout entouré de troupes, l'horizon se brouille
Le cœur qui s'emballe, les idées qui s'embrouillent
Ataï a dégainé la sagaie, il lance sa lance sur l'assaillant
La bataille a débuté, là, ça y est
Il combat les traîtres tout en saignant
Mais un ennemi lui semble familier
Serait-ce un Kanak de naissance
Qui, aux colons blancs, se serait rallié?
Et qui lui tranche le cou au nom de la France

Ataï fut décapité, son peuple colonisé
Son crâne fut exposé dans les musées, comme un trophée

Toujours les yeux rivés vers la Mecque
Vers la Mecque vers la Mecque vers la Mecque

Toujours en cellule, j'ai l'habitude mais les keufs débarquent dans quelques minutes

On vise la victoire vise la victoire
Blancs jaunes beurs ou noirs

Tu brilleras comme une étoile une star
Soit ma big big team
Parce que le ciel est la limite
Big team
Parce que le temps passe si vite
Même si mon quartier est difficile
On vise la victoire
J'ai la victoire au bout du fil

O.K. je pars au quart de seconde
Ma rage sort de ses gonds
Car on se souvient du premier mais rarement du second
Et puis laisse parler ces cons
Laisse ces cons et leurs zesses-gon
Rafle les médailles comme un gymnaste de Hong-Kong
Mon slogan gare au 7-6
Rap au plexus, gagne en silence comme Carlos et Smith
J'ai la carrosserie du risque dans l'industrie du disque
J'ai les keys de la réussite et sa carte grise
Tu veux les étoiles, vise la Lune
Petit fils allume, ta vie insalubre
Vaincre, c'est comme le Port-Salut c'est écrit dessus
Cherche le salut dans les saintes écritures
Puisque l'histoire est écrite par les békés
J'ai raturé le cahier pour y marquer L.K.P héhé
Habillés anti Caraïbes et Arabie

Non, non non non
On ne plie pas même si on prend des coups
Même si la route est longue elle-elle est longue on ira jusqu'au bout
Nous mettre des bâtons dans les roues
Ça ne sert à rien du tout
On connait le goût, de la difficulté
Garçon on gravit les étapes les étapes évite les obstacles et les tacles
Encaisser des claques et des claques et des claques, on a l'habitude
Comme Barack-Barack Obama je vise le top
All by myself vise la victoire comme Usain Bolt
Depuis le cordon ombilical, dans la rue c'est la mode illégal
On est des gars déterminés, mental dur comme le métal
On brillera comme l'étoile du Berger
On a bien scruté le fond, l'heure est venue pour nous d’émerger hé-hé-hé-hé
On puise, notre force, dans l'espoir
On s'épuise, mais à force, d'y croire
Un jour on connaitra la gloire qu'on soit blancs beurs jaunes noirs
Non Non Non Non
Restons seuls, on termine notre histoire

Parce que le temps passe si vite
Parce qu'on veut viser la victoire
Et ne plus marcher tout seul dans le noir
Et si la vie ne tient qu'à un fil
Et si mes traces sont indélébiles
Même so mon quartier est difficile
J'ai la victoire au bout du fil",Viser la Victoire,2010
Medium Cool,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Medium Cool,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1993
Medium Cool,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Keep this love alive for us, it's all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess, either one is my addiction
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But living in your arms, I can take it
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver

Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth?
I love you still

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

Don't let him get too close to you
You've got a stranger on your mind
The dream is free
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflections will show
This connection we can lean on each other

And so much pain

I was in Dogg sippin, straight DoggHouse crippin
Fuck wit us and get that ass bombed out
Need some smoke, for the homies from the south
This is what it's all about
It's the city of the beach where the gangsters bang
Sam wake that ass up, get fresh, let's do some thangs
Swerve through the eastside Loc, scoop up the homies
Bang them other fools cuz them busters don't know me
It seems like this is my only chance to get rich
Invest in my chips, never chippin off a bitch
Trip, bring that bomb to me
Underwater with cocaine, crackin with P O P
Up, up, up in smoke, you can hit it in a bong
I'm faded like Cheech and Chong
Watch out for the second hand smoke

Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah
Representin mines to be a true Eastsidah
Survival of the fittest, how we live this shit
Fuck a bitch, dump a clip, out to get them chips
No restrictions, takin off as soon as friction
Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in
Pimp wearin khaki suits and stacy biscuits
And known like Capone to them gangsta bitches
Keep em workin somethin everywhere we go
Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe
West coast to the fullest but I bang the east
Mad motherfuckers side to that city Long Beach
So throw them gang signs up when you see me ride up
And know for sure I'm bouta throw the eastside up

Got jugs of water buried all across my yard
One time on my line tryin ta find a cause
Toss a nigga in the street and reach up under my balls
Guns cocked, mug shots, cell blocks and locked down
But I done made it too far to stop now
Results of a banger, to most I'ma danger
No hope for those who come to close to the chamber
Bitches lovin I'ma gangster so fuck it
No matta if I hafta I get at em in a bucket
Tuckin in my shirt and all that shit don't work
First look, say I'ma crook that did dirt for the turf
High talk, high walk, when I stalk the street
Gurantee who try to see me come across the feet
It's a eastside lifestyle, wild and foul
Goin out, puttin it down sayin fuck the trial
Aim is to be famous wit major loot
A gang of juice, in case I gots to bring the troops
And everybody know the eastside the craziest

Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don’t let ‘em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin’ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon’ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon’ get here
Pyrex vision, made more than I ever made with DTP this year

And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry

Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch

If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right

I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane

Beemer 760i, try me let off sixty shots
Again we got the city hidin’, poppin’ like it ‘posed to be
Hoes who not ménaging got no business standin' close to me
So cold, a ferocious G, niggas ain't as dope as me
Mind your fuckin’ business, watch your mouth when you approachin' me
I fuck with hoes who fuck with hoes, do pills and powder socially
I like 'em, I don't love ‘em though, cold heart emotionally
Had me where the ocean is, ridin' in a ghost again
Slap you with a lot of spit until she swallow all of it
Call the shots, run the shit, on some big money shit
Serious 'bout my hustle all these cowards on that funny shit
Rappin’ 'bout a bunch of shit
And you ain't even done it yet
You the one they gunnin’ at
How I'm ‘posed to honour that
You all talk dawg, flaw and I ain't havin' none of that
I'm big boss dawg floss all day, and run it back

Bitch I'm a boss (huh)

Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh)

Now where my mufuckin’ crown?

I’ma boss, she a boss
He don’t care what it cost
You just buy that motherfucker and you throw that shit on
You keep poppin’ them tags
We just throw it in bags
And then we hit the fucking block, we be droppin' them rags

Started with a dollar, turn it to an M
Used to ride Impala, turn it to a Benz
Niggas used to hate me, turn into my friends
You should see how people treat you when that money coming in
Bad bitches callin’ cause I'm ballin’
And these niggas hatin’ on me cause they starvin'
And I'm parkin' Aston Martins where they walkin'
These niggas ain't important
They informants really talkin' when them people get to honkin'
I'm a boss really, Nino or Al Pacino
Hundred racks on his Rollie, he light up like a casino
Niggas really be fraudin', I’ma keep it a C note
Got shooters down in Miami, they throw it like Dan Marino

Huh

Had a couple seizures, call 'em minor setbacks
Everybody prayin' for me, I respect that
Woke up in the hospital, where my checks at
Then I put eight chains where my necks at
Hoppin' in the Ghost, I feel I'm best at
Worth forty M's, I respect that
I put all my jewels on just to bone your chick
You know the boss well known for leavin' bonuses
We makin' money, may it marinate
When the work clean, cut it like it’s carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still whip it like it’s Anna Mae
Remember Momma had a Cavalier
Now she livin' like a Cleveland Cavalier
Better check the stats, we fillin' arenas
And I got the gats, Gilbert Arena’s

Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh)
I call the calls (huh)
We in this bitch
It’s goin’ down
Yeah, I'm the king
Now where my mufuckin’ crown?

If you a boss, you a boss
Seven five, seven showers on her
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

Look, I be probably on my skateboard, tryna learn a new trick
I just fucked a Avatar, now I got a blue dick
Money talks, bullshit walks if the shoe fit
You pushin' up daisies, daffodils, tulips
I'm in my zone, I'm Angie Stoned
I point the pistol at you like a camera phone
I'm Young Money, Cash Money, I'm not human
Boy I’m tryna get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she don’t respect me, she gon' respect this dick
The world is a asshole and we the next big shit
Damn right I gang bang, tell 'em blood up slime
Fuck, I had to say fuck one time, get it

When I came up in this bitch I was shinin' every summer
Took the whole thing, the young nigga doin' numbers
Tote two nines bitch, iced out stuntin’
Candy on the ave, candy on the slab
Hundred G’s nigga, Cash Money Millionaires
Hundred mill nigga, how we flipped it off the ave
Blood rich gang, you know we filthy nigga
The money do swing, behind a killin' nigga
Catch me uptown puttin’ it down
Movin' all around, new fleets with my round
Touch another town, puttin’ it all down
Pop a hundred bottles bitch, we wear the crown

Bitch I'm a boss (huh)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh)

Look at my bitch, look at my wrist, got these niggas upset
Who you know blow a mill? Don't even think twice, no sweat
And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can't hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angel bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a perk, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
.357 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than Corona
And if they act like they ain't with it

I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get the cock
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dade-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top

Was on my grind cause times were harder than the cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it
Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon

Nigga talking like a G but walking like a broad
I pull up at the light, pineapple in your car

I court killers at the center of my synagogue
Torch in hand, extortion to the fortune five hundred
From the porches to the Porsche's with the wides on it
'Fore you snitches bitch, you better put your lives on it
Get you twisted by the ? with them wires on it
I get my money smoking spliffs like it's Friday

Real nigga, I hold no grudge with no thugs
Come through spraying, bullets out the McLaren
They ain't meant for you, so move bitch, you hard of hearing?
I speed off doing 90 with the Carter blaring
Bust shots in the Cavalier like I ball with Baron
Yeah I Blake Griff niggas, make stiff niggas
Eminem wasn't Dr. Dre's only sick nigga

Insane in the membrane like Soul Assassins
Twelve gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin
First forty-eight, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out

Ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch
A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on, I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
So your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream

It's ironic how I drop some dough when I got them Homer Simpsons, look
Pine-green Foams, they may never see the store
Got LeBron Entourages like Maverick and Richie Paul
Bitch, I ball, ho, you lame, look at my Laneys, switchin' lanes
Look at my nines, look at my Blazers, look at my fours, cut wit' laser
Look at my whore, that is your lady, look at my flo', makin' y'all crazy
Makin' y'all sick, y'all cannot tame me, Lexus drive me, Maybach pay me
Salute

I said I'm swaggin' out in my Cool Greys, no LL, but these cool Js
And my wrist froze, but I'm cool sha', like a bald head, I'm too paid
I'm too blazed, and I'm too high, George Kush, the whole crew high
Wrong move and that tool fly, better Kon that ass like Wu-sai
It's MMG, MOB, young nigga, I been OG
Walk around wit' like ten on me, that five seven, that fen' on me
Don't grin on me wit' them long stares, you ain't God unless no fear
Big money, all the hoes, HD, I came so clear
We jeweled out and we racked up, Phantom big when it back up
Big Boy, look like a Mack truck, shooters ride wit' that Mac tucked
I'm a Bad Boy, bitch, ask Puff, Simpson-Rodgers, my last cup
On this shit, I can't stand up, country Ks as I man up
This Rozay, Wale, Gunplay, and that nigga Pill
In Brazil, and this shit is real, got bad hoes and that whippet pill
One week and we get the deal, one day and I fucked the bitch
My Levis, they five o one, my snapback is hella bent

[Chorus]

Fresh-ass nigga, no wonder why them hoes be open
That's that nigga, so what'd I say? They okey-dokin'
How you figga? You fuckin' wit' me? I hope he jokin'
I'm witcha girl, you home alone, bitch you Macauley Culkin
I'm oviedosin', ay, homie, Kobe smokin'
Then put my ashes on you niggas, bet you gon' need lotion
I'm slowly roastin', heatin' up, so you know we toastin'
Fuck hoes wit' no emotion, fade away like Kobe postin'
Out in Sweden, like ain't shit that you can't tell us
Lord, forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
'Cause uh, they had them Js, and my mama wouldn't cop 'em
Can you blame her? Hundred dollars for them bitches wann't a option
Now we livin' much better, nigga, pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about 'em forever
My kicks like my chick, I don't need to know the numbers
You just need to know I'm comin', I'll kill you niggas this summer

Audemar on my wrist, bustdown
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winning touchdown
Remember Meek dead broke? Look at me, up now
I run my city from south Philly back to uptown
Thank god, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped
I done sold a hundred thousand before my album got dropped
And I'm only 23 I'm the shit now look at me
Look at me I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shawty asked me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
'Cause I made it from the bottom there was nothin' on the way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay

All I need is a kilo, a apron, show me the stove 
General electric, perfected, cooking them O's 
No more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves 
Hoes, I need a condom for my toast, busting in these niggas 
Standing flat footed, I'm on my toes 
Froze, pandemonium overdose 
Paparazzi in the trees, please curtains closed 
Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf 
Heroin transactions, with Russian shots of the Smirnoff 
Playing for keeps I buss in 'em 'fore she get off 
I run the city just pull up and drop the kid off 
Welcome to organized crime 
Money got me excited, I'm coming four or five times 
The forty five for you niggas with nine lives 
Penthouse on college, money long as Ocean drive 
Black Chevy Tahoe's, Hatians up out the pothole 
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos 
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off in the synagogue 
Issue you your warrant, informant, bitch I've been a boss 
Counting money stacks, yours counter-fitted 
I made my money back, when your accountant didn't 
Went against the odds, its only one Rozay 
My nigga OKAY

Million in the trunk

Money knocking at the front door I'm like ""who is it?"" 
It's Benjy, tell my lil nigga ""goin get it"" 
Cause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute 
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm spend it

Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it 
Four for my niggas that be stacking it and then blowing it 
You would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in 
Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium 
Probly got them keys in, he like my custodian 
I was tryna bag a brick you was Nickelodeon 
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it 
We's part the reason that them Churches got some services 
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering 
Nigga called my phone talking reckless I aint heard of it 
Fuck ya girl, give her back I'm courteous 
I can keep a secret with Vicky have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and telling Megan Good morning 
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris

You think you using me
Like this games new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry and all them fuckin' shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me
And I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

I'm incline with women who come on they time
She came over and she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over had her shopping in Milan
Twenty racks really that's sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari yeah that's the Easter bunny
At the Caesar in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend a half the ticket give or take
A couple dollars Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything plane chartered
I spoiled her maybe 'cause I adored her
More than fly that girls a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
And she said the love of picture just roll the dice

[Chorus]

I try to love 'em in the physical not literal
She said that she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner soul
So the devil that droves in her got in control
Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up
Though my paper way thicker than model make up
But ya'll wait up my mind racing my toe slippin'
A lot of women is real some bitches Robin Givings
I never give 'em no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin' bitches that's dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fuckin' with bitches that know they whole position
That's real nigga shit
Real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I trying for the money, they tryna fall in love.

[Chorus]

I say, how can they compare to you
Everything material
Trickin' shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal
You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
So I let others shit you on dead, burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honey moon and you
Like the sound and I ain't ever try tuning you
But now I'm just assuming you
Living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio 'cause everything was air play
First class herm ass
Panamera perp pass
Greed written on her face
When I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck
It was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga puff
Just play your role and you can live it up

No looking back at me

Meek Mill,"Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I think Ima dedicate this one
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Dream chasers

Yeah, it was all a dream
On the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'

Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em
Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs

Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is
Mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now
Transparent ceiling now


Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thou mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban Linx's equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed",Maybach Curtains,2012
Meek Mill,"Yeah, yeah
I remember

I remember nights I used to sell rock, posted on the corner like a mailbox
First class ticket to a cell block, just to get some Polo and some shell tops
Cold world and they say hell's hot
But it ain't hotter than that choppa when them shells drop
Man I seen niggas play that block and get they bell rocked
Cops cleared the scene and I was back by twelve o'clock
Tryna get it, Dickies on and my fitted
Gun in my draws, ducking the law, I'm all with it
Money, cars and clothes, I wanted 'em all nigga
I never was good at hoopin', I wanted to ball nigga
Cause the OG's sold keys and I had no cheese
Coppers lock me, beat me down like I was Cochise
Old fiends coppin' work through their old dreams
They got shattered, it ain't matter cause we thirst cream
Niggas serving niggas moms just to make a flip
Homies murder other homies just to make a brick
Most my niggas done got busted tryna take a hit
The feds were lurking, we was serving, they was taking flicks

This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops

I done seen close neighbours lose hope
Fall victim to the streets and start to use dope
I used to load my gun before I went to school first
It's crazy niggas wanna kill me, we was cool first
And when it comes to friends you can't let 'em too close
That's why they call 'em close friends, you turn your back they move first
And I just bought a new Ghost, and a crib out on that new coast
And it all started from a dolla
Running from the law, scuffing up my Pradas
Crack all in my draws, tryna make a profit
All I wanted was some shells and some Polo for my closet, aww
Drug money, turn to blood money
I only roll with niggas that'll take a slug for me
No matter what it is, I'mma pay that bail money
To get my niggas right, my niggas for life!

Riding through my city with a chick I used to lust
Bout to make a movie starring me, the two of us
Penthouse at the top floor, elevator shooters up
So I can eat that pussy for breakfast, dinner, and lunch
And uh, she been waiting all night for this hard pipe
I think she called twice
Before you knew it I pulled in she seen them fog lights
And I can see it in her face she had a hard night
Up and down that pole selling dreams, selling love
It was sort of like she serving fiends and selling drugs
Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like

She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in the ass and she heard them pipes they was growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' leer in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder, ball horrible out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes

She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm really getting mad money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate

Meek Mill,"Paulie killed Tony right and Tony killed Ty so it was only right
Bring 'em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
'Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
'Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LOOORD)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now

Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on 'em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid 'em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on 'em
Said it's on now, try and kill 'em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now
Momma and little kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain it really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his beamer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done so he loadin' up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight he don't give a fuck if the law come

So he out here
Ridin' dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin 'em they tryna hit 'em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with 'em
Youngin' layin' low he know Paulie ain't playin' though
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin' go
But youngin' he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tag-toed
It was four in the morn', Paulie goin' home
Windshields wiping, middle of the rain storm
And Paulie he ain't slipping yeah he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block before he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear view it's like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezing, trying get him off him
Them shots ringing youngin' squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle

I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it
And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly
We was young and gettin' money, man we used to run the city
We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes
And when they killed Darryl, Renee had to see him froze on the ground
Downtown, I can hear the sounds now

When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tock in his eyes
Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know Ima ride

Hope you hear me, Ima kill you nigga
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So Ima let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days Ima let this rain hit you nigga

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth

Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future lookin' brighter than this rose I'm starin' at
We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish
Rest in peace to my niggas, I swear I miss them to death
My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death
I'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest
Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell and Ness
I'm gone

Man my life so real
Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills
Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil
And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill
Man I almost got murked in front of the same church
My dad got carried in, family got married in
That was in my older days, this is now, that was then
Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion
Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant
Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em
Lock 'em like a terrier
Breakin' all barriers

Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius
Cause cops tryna catch me, niggas tryna clap me
Haters runnin' at me, know they wanna get at me
And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy
I did it for my niggas, and I did this shit for Kathy

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide

Walkin’ through my city but it’s lookin’ like I run things
Runnin’ shit, diarrhea

G5 through the sky boy we outta here
Sippin P&J fresh from out the PJ

Young kings, young kings
I be rollin’ with some young kings, young kings
And all we know is one thing, one thing
Get the money nigga fuck fame, and fuck fame
I be rollin’ with some young kings, young kings
Rollin’ with some young kings, young kings
And all we know is one thing, one thing
Get the money nigga fuck fame, and fuck fame

I still wake up go and get it, youngin' on a mission
'Cause when niggas was eating they left me to do the dishes
But I’m different, I still put ‘em on just to show ‘em right
I used to be the dark child but now I glow at night
I keep a milli by my side because we both alike
Try and keep that nigga out the field `cause he be throwin’ white

Dishin’ d, tryna get rich as me
I’m worth a couple million man that shit was meant to be
20 gold chains on, shit I think I’m Mr. T
If I could live my life again I wouldn’t do it differently
Prolly bring my father back, just so he could witness me
Back up in my zone I swear my haters is history
Bitches say they missin’ me, I never fall for it
`Cause they just miss the money, they know I go hard for it
And if my niggas need it, I tell ‘em come for it
'Cause when it comes to me, they shootin’ like a small forward, swish

To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mill so many times, I contemplated
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation

Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sippin' purple and that muthafucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated

I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later

Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated 'cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it

Still money over these hoes
Got YSL on my clothes
And blood drip on my sneakers
Nigga, you hating on me, she chose
And I ain't fuck your girl she rode
My stick-shift she drove
Did everything that she 'posed to
I pulled my camera out and she posed
And I was like, got that
Drop that, pop that
Got the top back on the drop back, I'm back
And the Glock at where the crotch at, I'm strapped
All the rocks at where the watch at, stop that
Could you cop that? Not that
I'm light send the mob at, dime sack I'm catching on contact
Got racks, y'all niggas ain't 'bout that, 'bout that life!

Poof! There go the car
Poof! There go the crib
Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield

Poof! There go the car
Poof! There go the crib
Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield

Poof! Nigga fuck your life
Fuck your niggas and fuck your wife (Fuck 'em!)
Got two bad bitches with a nigga
And you know they gon' fuck all night (Right)
And I rock hard white
Nigga rich game pride
I'll pull up on whores and I'm sitting on fours, in a big boy drop
Call big boy shots, all clear stones in my big boy watch
All year long, got the strip on lock
Everytime we in this bitch, man, shit gon' pop
My hip on Glock, your hip on nothing
My niggas got racks, y'all niggas be fronting
Red Cartier, redbone bitch
Red bottoms on her, hair long as shit (Hold up)
Yellow gold Ro', yellow bone ho
And yellow bottles of Spades, nigga
Whole clique self made, nigga

Poof! There go the car
Poof! There go the crib
Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield

Meek Mill,"If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle

Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga, ugh!",Power Circle,2012

Pull up in the Maserati, got them bitches lookin' at me like I shot somebody
I'm stackin' paper, I need that dropped Ferrari
Got them trying to claim a nigga and we not on Maury

Look in the magazine, the same exact as Jay-Z (Same one)
I'm gettin' money, nigga you straight flea
That bitch be shining thunder up I call it KD

Bad bitch stand 6 feet, standin' on this money bought a new fleet

[Chorus]

Look at my wrist, that shit 200 hundred thou'
Cut the lights down, look at me now
Back then they didn't want me, now I'm hot and they all on me
Pull a bunch of these white bitches, I'm chillin hard at the Pink Pony
Gucci Mane and Meek Mills, I'm ballin hard, I'm too trill
New ride with new money, so I had to put it on new rims
Hawks game, I'm court side
Red bottles on the wet floor, give them up to the athletes
Smellin' like a pound of dro, Versace shades I'm yoked out
Rolls Royce it smoked out, parked in front your whole house
I blew the horn, she jumped out
Maybach on cascade, the one on down my west side
4 girls, only fucked 3
Cause one left, and she missed out

Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment, is close

Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don’t let ‘em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin’ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon’ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon’ get here
Pyrex vision, made more than I ever made with DTP this year

Tired of livin’ day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that shit, hell
Next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustlin I'm gon’ shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

Just waiting on my moment
Bad hoes I’m showin'
Time came and I owned it
Just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the rock I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
On you bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who err'body gon’ root for
They see my come from that bottom
Where err'body get bodied
They told me get em, I got em
Now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis
And m4 this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine
If I don't shine, then I don’ eat
Won’t eat, then Ima starve
If I'ma starve, I pull heat
On all yall bitch ass niggas
All y'all rich ass niggas
'Cause if I don’ make no money nigga

Niggas gon' talk about you
And that's completely fine with me (Believe that, nigga)
Niggas only salute niggas that's dead, and niggas in prison (Living legends)

I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes

I got a house on my neck, my Panamera my pet
We bought ringside seats, and got a brick I can pet
Money, power respect, I took your bitch with finesse
Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess
What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price
When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life
Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife
Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice
Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice
760 new Beamer, got me rolling in white

I heard them suckas was hatin', I'm fucking all of they hoes
So I don't blame 'em, no I don't knock 'em
But if they play my dogs, we slay 'em, I'm talkin' pop 'em
Want some attention, hall-of-fame 'em, they talkin' bout us
Acting like bitches 'til we spray 'em, get the coffin out ya
We all about it, ahhhhh

I hustle like I'm on my last check !!
And I ain't even in my bag yet

All I see is this money, never hate with your niggas
Better pray to your maker, before you war with the sinner
Ask forgiveness for mine, so I know that I'm good
All them niggas we robbed, trips T man took
Talkin' panhandle pimpin, niggas Chevy was lemon
Nigga dressing in linen, bases loaded first inning
Taking over the checks, relocating the tenants
Pulling open your vest, motivation is spinach
I gotta handle my business, I pay my mortgages first
When you cross a super-soaker I bet your water get burst
Ain't no love on this side, just jealous niggas who ride

Meek Mill,"Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

They told me get 'em, I got 'em,
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I ain't never asked for no handouts
You won't carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they ain't mad at me,
I'm on fire and I'm gon' burn
And they ain't gon' learn,
I remember they said that it ain't my turn
But it ain't confirmed, then the table's turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I ain't gon' stop, 'cause I'm gon' climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let's go

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Path that I choose flashing cameras as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred wreck she don't know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell tryin' to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it's hundreds and millions, this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the born achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

Can't fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby still know who you are
So you gotta keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the rope
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
(Get 'em, get 'em, get em)
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
(Stay on your toes)
Don't let 'em ever count you out
(No, no, no, no)
(Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em go)
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

G Season

Told you motherfuckas once, prison ain't change me
All it did was make a nigga crazy deranged see
Psycho, nuts so, what I give a fuck for?
All I know now is to get out and go for the gusto
So, fuck niggas fuck hoes, he said, she said, nigga and what so?
Fuck what they say bout my cases, fuck what they say bout my lady
Fuck what they say we were doing on that day of visitation
All I care 'bout is my out date and this nature of probation
How much dough I'm set to make and where I'm gon' go on vacation
Wait, damn, okay that's way too far ahead of me
So I'm just tryna take it day to day if they would let a G, breath
Cop cars by the three's, Bitches call me papa Johns 'cause I keep that extra cheese
Overseas in the sun, livin' for the fun in Milan with some bad bitches
Probably wanna yawn, when will it dawn on 'em I'm a Don
Ridin' foreign, curtains drawn, gettin' blown by a blond, I'm the bomb
Terrorist, hella rich, wreckin' shit
Nigga ask about me homie I suggest you tell 'em this

Paper plates on my Aston Martin bitch I'm ballin
Killin' all my haters tell yo mama pick your coffin
Hundred rounds shawty I just gotta pick a target
Put my name on that flyer, watch the party get retarded
And I go crazy in that bitch, stunt like Baby in that bitch
Got yo lady on my dick, 'cause I got like 80 on my wrist
KOD, I make it rain, I know they hate me in that bitch
So I be there just throwin' money like they paid me for that shit, hold up!
Started in the back now I'm that nigga in the front
Shorty want the real and I’mma give her what she want
OG nigga you can put it in the blunt
Fuckin' all the baddest bitches, I'm a hit 'em from the front
Just to see the faces on her, when a nigga lay it on her
Every time she ride that dick, I tell her go Jamaican on it

Like a volcano have lava runnin' out yo face
Hey, if yo ass out of place
You'll find the weapons they took away I'll replace
What can I say? Another year, another case
Another sentence completed, I'm confident and conceited
I'm sucker free, sucker ducking, so tell them suckers to beat it
Don't fuck with me busta, trust me your future will be deleted
Such a G, ain't no touching me, luckily I defeated the odd
Without my tool, Allah and glory to God, and I ain't even Islamic
So sick, whenever I vomit just throw me a mill or 2
And that oughta settle my stomach
Bout some money he done it, call me Mr. He Run It
These niggas ain't really bout it, they just be speaking Ebonics
I'm nothing short of iconic, promise you, you don't want it
Strong as gin and tonic, my left you won't see it coming
My right you'll be running from it, I catch you with it, you done
I'm a keep it a 100, you better get you a gun
Word bond real talk, do my dirt all by my lonely

Meek Mill,"I don’t mind,
Rushing through traffic just to get dinner ready in time
And I, don’t mind,
Calling when I’m late just to give you peace of mind
And I, don’t mind,
You staying out all night long hanging with the guys
But I do mind,
When you look me right dead in the eye and you tell me lies

You see it pays to tell the truth,
Look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do,
Did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth,
Feel so sorry for you
You could have had it all, too bad you gotta fall
Now you leave, (Now you leave with zero)
Nothing, (Now you leave with zero), Nada
(Now you leave with zero)
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
(Now you leave with zero) Nothing
(Now you leave with zero) Nada
(Now you leave with zero) You see it pays to tell the truth, ohh

Why I tried,
Giving you chances just to get your act right
And I, I tried,
Everything from praying to breaking things, to getting out of line
Those tears, I cried,
They hurt so deep inside
They almost drained me dry
But now, it’s time,
For you to man up 'cause I’m taking back what’s mine

You see it pays to tell the truth,
Look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth,
Feel so sorry for you
You could have had it all,
Too bad you gotta fall Now you leave,

But you didn’t do it
(Nothing, now you leave with zero), nothing
(Now you leave with zero) Nada
(Now you leave with zero) You see it pays to tell the truth

I lie just to protect you, never to disrespect you
'Cause what we have was so 38 special
And it was times that I heard niggas test you
But I ain’t even ask, I was just waiting to catch you
But you caught me and everything was on me
It was time to face the music, everything was on key
And them lies sounded good, didn’t it, now you sick of me?
Now I’m supposed to leave with zero, is you kidding me?
One minus one equals none
And if you gonna leave then you might leave with some
But you gonna think about me every time you see my son
And Ima think about you every time I see the sun, in the morning
It’s gonna be times we get caught up in the moment
But don’t turn your back on your man you belong with
'Cause if you loose then I loose too
But if you cool then I’m cool too (Now you leave with nothing)

(Now you leave with zero) Nothing,
Now you leave with zero), Nada
(Now you leave with zero)
You see it pays to tell the truth but u didn't do it

With that top off and that drop head
Pull up on ‘em, they drop dead
Niggas talkin’ that bird shit
When them birds came, they was not dead
And I was out there with that work
From the 15th to the 1st
My clique mean and they merk
We’ll let them clips squeeze like dirt
When it come to them dollars, nigga, why bother?
These niggas don’t want no problems
‘Cause I’ll kill all y’all dead, put a price on your head
Get your brain, I doubt it
I be on that fly shit – M-O-B that mob shit
Boy, I’m talkin’ G5 shit
Fifty racks for that ride, shit

That’s right, I am YMCM, Grave Street, play that, there
Burnin’ up the track like a motherfuckin’ matchstick,

Tryna shine when you come around stars like us
They do look dim
Ain’t got your game tight, ain’t got your swag up
Shame on them
Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big

So sorry that your girl’s suckin’ my dick

La balance qui m'écoute, qu'elle aille niquer sa grand-mère
Je lui souhaite un putain de cancer
Brinks dans le viseur
Pisté par les kissdés, plus rien dans le rétroviseur
Tous cagoulés dans le tieks, j'égorge les têtes de réseaux
Mets le feu à toute la tess, j'aurais dû signer chez ESSO
J'aurais dû signer chez ESSO, BP ou Shell
Si je parle pas c'est que ma bouche est pleine de kérosène
Je rappe pour Fleury, Nanterre et Fresnes

Cocaine Mulsanne, young nigga blowing up - Kurt Cobain

Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got 'em and he had them birds on 'em
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll wit him
Caught a case what you think, nigga fucking told on 'em

Meek Mill,"If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I grew 'em better
Like I'm under a goal post, I'm two official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though, try to hit the Jummah
Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said ""you winning, why BOA pray so much?""
I said ""you tripping, such winners make niggas pray on us""
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

Folarin in this ma'fucka
Still talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, oh, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don't be a statistic
How your main bitch sending me pictures?
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah nigga, I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If your a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back

This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole world, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young CO, L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got penny's for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest is a helluva start
It's Cole... World... nigga",Black Grammys,2013
Meek Mill,"It's so hard for me to sit back here, in this studio,
Looking at a guy out here hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor

Wheeling dealing, Limousine riding, Jet Flying, son of a gun

Young nigga in the low low
Jumpin' out the thing with a little bad bitch like YOLO

In the hood where there ain't no hope
Now everybody ridin' dirty like there ain't no soap
Everybody get to rappin' when there ain't no coke
Where the money nigga
Cop 44 a bird where I live at
Probably buy the whole load if you get it back
Fish scale when snapped rented rack
Little nigga you ain't stuntin' give that rental back, oh
I like fast cars, fast broads
And my last car was like a Nascar it go vroom, vroom
Then skrr, skrr before I blast off
She go up and down like NASA

Pop a wheelie all in that pussy she switchin' gears on this dick nigga

Papi said he got them bricks and we gon' take 'em down
I call Omelly bring them shooters, we gon' break it down
He said he coming and he coming in with 80 pound
We finna line a nigga up and we gon' take 'em down
""Hello"" (""Dimelo?"")
""Papi where you at?"" (""Mi camino"")
He said it's in and I'm like Papi bring the set
He brought his shooter, I'mma 'prolly bring the MAC
I spent my money on a lawyer and it's time to get it back
I got niggas in the bushes and they lurking
Young niggas barely legal but they murking
I hit them with the Desert Eagle and it's curtains
I'mma shoot him in his head cause I heard that nigga working

Riding four deep, on my way to Meek
Said he got a lick for us, know this nigga sweet
Said he got 80 johns, who to call but me?
So I called my dogs, cause my dogs gotta eat
Let him off the leash now it's time to feast
Got McDonald's money but I'm tryna eat Philippe's
Tired of all this drought shit, this broke shit ain't me
If this thing go right, it's gon' put me on my feet, where I need to be
I ain't lying Meek, this nigga move, I'm leaving him
I got some loose cannons and they all agreeing with me
Black glove, black hoodies, I brought the team with me
Black strap, MAC-10, brought the machines with me
Now we slidin' down the North, to 23rd and Berks
Cause Papi he got that work
Young hitters they with me, they tryna murk
I just tell them ""chill we gon' take him for what he worth""

Load up the AK and the mothafucka MAC-11
Hundred thangs to a dope boy, fucking blessing
Hit up Boobie told him ""meet me on 183rd""
Funny how 187 get your boy hundred burst
Bang, Dade County niggas ain't a game
We call them sticks missed calls they gon' let 'em ring
SK's I just grabbed last month nigga
My new shooter I ain't prayed in a month nigga
Got the devil in him, all he know is M 1
Told them bring back all the paper in 10 tons

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)

Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Fresh, whips
Candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich
Put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions
Stunna island, we packin'
Rich gang, we uptown
Nigga hardbody and mackin'
Tool on that back, nigga
Money and that power
Mansion on that beach, nigga
Blood red Bugatti
Versace on my bitch, nigga
Blow a mil' like it's a dollar

I woke up in a new Bugatti (This the remix!)

Woke up with the crown nigga
Serving Bobby Brown nigga
Started from the bottom now it's Carter, Nino Brown nigga
Take my spot nigga never will
Now I know how 'melo feel
We both shooters from New York
But I shown nigga how the metal feel
Fidel Castro with them cuban links
With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit

Meek Mill,"We all get caught in our own sins
Sometimes I have to remind myself
That on my worst day I live like somebody on their greatest and so do you
Don't let your demons take you to hell, introduce them to heaven

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doing life, they ain't ever coming home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me cause she said I did her wrong
'Cause I left to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listening to me
That back and forth arguing was getting in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part time
I used to play the block early morning and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rapping brought me back to life
'Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strapping like we was in Iraq to fight
'Cause niggas getting murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Woah, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boiling water, in the world of no order
In the hood ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'mma get the fam right, nigga you damn right

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hopping out of shit
Right now I'm praying for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell a difference
My man coming home, my other man getting sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hating on your pictures
We dream chasing, y'all niggas walking behind wishes
Without working for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothing all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a head shot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's see through

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life",Heaven or Hell,2014

Meek Mill,"R.I.P to my lil' nigga Snupe

Yeah, we the realest niggas in this shit
Pulling live out of Philly
Young nigga love popping bad bitches and wheelies
And I'm talking all this money, now these niggas can't feel me
Money long, team strong so these niggas can't kill me, ah
I get a rush from this lifestyle, solid gold presidential with the ice dial
When the chasers in the building turn the lights down
'Cause every single nigga with me gon' be iced out
Block party, living life wild
I go to court for probation and looking like trial
The DA told me she want a nigga but right now
I'm living better than ever, I'm thinkin' like, ""How?""
Is it the money? Is it the cars?
Is it the way a nigga living that took me this far?
But still they want me with the sins and give me them bars
They lock a nigga in the dark I still look like a star
I shine, I grind harder, I'm working my mind smarter
I take care of my grandmama, mama, my ma's daughter
They telling me I ain't shit, I made it for my father
I just hope you pray for me, matter fact sing for me

Lil Snupe
They killed my lil' nigga Snupe, my lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell lil' nigga shoot?
'Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

As I'm rolling through my city, nigga, all I see is murder
Ain't nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it
And ain't nobody hiring so everybody serving
And all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin, better get a strap
Young niggas selling 'caine just to get it back
And they busting out them racks till they sitting back
And if a nigga hit my homie, we gon' hit him back
And if you send him over here, know we gon' send him back
My flow iller, I came up from dope dealing
I been sayin' I'd make it, they telling me no
Nigga these voices all in my head just telling me go get it
I came up on four wheelers
Bananas and gorillas through the jungle
Where killers rumble and everyone perishing
Realest nigga in it no comparison
And they got the nerve to tell me I'm arrogant
But what the fuck, I'm young black, I made it in America
So I'ma ball harder than the ma'fucking Carter's
Beyoncé and Shawn, arm blue'er than their daughter
Maneuver through the water like a shark that's on a dolphin
Nigga darker, in a coffin devils on him, get em off him
I can look at your homies and tell you foul, dawg
Leaning with your left but you stand in southpaw
Be the same niggas that'll take you out, dawg
Leaving niggas hungry but you eating Mr. Chows, dawg
Where the love at? Where the love at?
I'll give up all this money to get lil' cuz back
Before my nigga go starving like where the grub at
Give up the fame, start over and get my buzz back
Do it again, murder his killer him and his friend
Put the arena, step on the stage, kill him again
Look at the stands the fans coming filling them in
To give my nigga a chance, see him winning again

Hey, you gon do somethin to
Who, what, when.
You say you want it with
Who, what, when.
Them shots come in with
Who, what, when.
You were sayin that to
Who, what, then, fuck nigga
You'd better get that fuck shit off your mind.
'Cause I'm a up that strap,
You crossed the line.
Cut these apples out you niggas startin spreadin the new.
When I choose shit on a corpse,
Hide head with the two

Where you can find me,
You can find me,
At the top of the list.
And if they ever let me in I ain't stoppin for shit.
See that motivation make you say I'm cocky as shit.
Watever, fuck it tell em suck and help part of my dick.
Now a day, play, I coulda possibly get em, get paid.
Get out the Maybach and go hop in the jet
Know they hatin on the rise and the chilled I spin.
In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man.
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand.
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan
Outa bed, rolled one homie, never again,
Cause I sold dough once now I sell it again
Fur weed 500, I sell it again
Tell the mice mane win let the elfs keep sayin

[Chorus]

Hide head with the two

I'm ballin half around, half a jet, nigga pound for pound
Only time we showin up, the shut this motha fucker down
Ridin round in the Kia, no spare tires
Chopper round shots fired,
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral.
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O.
Crow rock shells,
I bleach em and watch em fade away.
And leave a nigga block,
Wetter than a rainy day
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib.
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill.
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills.
School a hunt knox I'm a hate a cheetah.
One ya a dick sucka get your head up with the nina
And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava.
Ya best bet: to run the other way when I see ya

Living life on the road on the chase for the money

Ain't no love in the streets
Let her run into me and she wanted to meet
Now she fuck with a G
Got your bitch not wanting to speak
Hold up, y'all mahfuckers tried to shit on us
Chain all lit all up
Porsche with the horse like get on up
And my bitch got that shit on her
Rock Balmain 'cause I'm ballin'
I put red bottoms on red models
And no more red bottles
Straight Belarie nigga every bottles
Ricky Rozay we in here
Double M G we've been here
Straight from the north side
Right by the project how did I get here
Sippin' on lean with a bad ass bitch
From the Hills, probably live there

Uh, there's no love in the streets and this blood on my sneaks got suicide on them
Going everywhere you are not going
Doing everything you are not doing
Ooh, and I've been out to get it and you mention my niggas that's suicide on them
Right back to the money my nigga no we don't play
Say my name and that's D.O.A
And all these chains is saying we okay
And we drink Champagne, eat Frito Lays
At lunchtime, do it for the ghetto one time
I don't even know how to tell time
look at our time
'Cause the watch say bust down and the whole band is drumline
Me and my nigga, Rozay that's my nigga
D-Boy, that's my hitter
You ain't doing wrong, as long as you don't touch my hitter
South finger fuck my trigger
smoking on strong, none of y'all can fuck with us
None of y'all gossip, Jigga
Give me my throne, and you ain't gonna like my picture
Leave a comment, fuck nigga

I pray I'm a servant to all prophets
May I be rich forever

Money on my head, pussy boy, that ain't enough
Bullet to your trap strapped in my armored truck
Your mami house next, tell that bitch to duck
Ain't no sympathying in a city streets
That's all I ever heard from my older G's
She say she love me, but I know she play for keeps
Slip a black snake in a nigga's sheets
Bought a bitch a hundred acres, all red roses
Half you niggas Judas, I'm the son of Moses
Illuminated, resurrected as Selassie
Bob Marley through the trumpets on the day I die
Rolls Royces on dirt roads, we dope boys (Dope boys)

Baptized by the dope boys, ordained by the assholes
My salvation is the cash flow
Whoa, oh
I'm walking on air

I'm talking big bitch, I'm talking big
I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big
We do it big bitch, we do it big

I'm into fashion, nigga, John the Baptist
My loyalty respected all across the atlas
I can have you and your team finalized
All your kids screaming in Mount Sinai
Holy Ghost, the divine spirit
My heart pure, he a real nigga
She let me fuck early so she trustworthy
Her pussy sacred so she getting all the purses
In his name I'm Supreme Lord
The Book of Leviticus is the springboard
Jesus Christ, look at this nigga's ice
Better yet, look at this nigga's life
I'm walking on air

You already know, I give and go when I get that dough
Nigga with that O, I move that shit like tic-tac-toe
And these be niggas be hating like ""Meek Mill, how you get that ho?""
'Cause I get that dough, and I spit that flow
Just check my style and look at that Roll'
On my wrist, on some shit, make a call, ""Who is this?""
Think it's Benjie on the line and he called, tried to flip
What I do? Make a call, call Papi for a brick
And papi call José, 'cause José got fish
Now I'm 30,000 feet up with my feet up, rollin' weed up
Pussy niggas couldn't bluff us, couldn't beat us
Throwing curve balls in the field to get your ear like Derek Jeter
Double M, yeah that's the team, I know they see us, yeah

Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big
I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big
We do it big, bitch, we do it big

Fuck a tutor, better get a shooter
Teach your ass a lesson when they runnin' into ya
Fiends lining up like we having communions
This my daily bread and you niggas consumers
All I ever wanted was to make scrilla
Have a recording session with J Dilla
Selassie, Exodus
Corinthians, Leviticus
I'm on the books, I study well
Getting money, bitches know me well (Huh)

Ace gone stomp you out, then Buddah gone stomp you out

On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga

'Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels

Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro
Don't beef over no ho

Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas

Catch you at the red light, have em screamin “can’t get up""
Same nigga from the bottom ain’t a damn thing change
Catch me out in Collins screamin ""money ain’t a thang""
And them red Mulsanne, lookin like I claim blood
And if homie ain’t my homie than I know it ain’t love
Screamin out ""4 Hunnid,” YG that's my nigga

'Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, that feels good)

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me

He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo

'Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us

But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time

(But you waited)

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

Rolling, joking, smoking, thinking how I got here
Looking, loading toasters, pussy you was not there
Holding, never folding, we was on the top 10
Shackled to our ankles it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers on the same water you shit?
Doing your push ups right on the floor where you piss?
Cellmates with niggas that went to war with the strips
You got to rumble from night time down to the morning and shit

Forever label me felon
Clutchin' that pistol, God made me rebellious
Fuck with them niggas, teach you a lesson
Fingers on triggers, meet Smith and Wesson
I seen pussy niggas turn on me

Bullets gon' riddle you, they gon' use two to feed you
Momma gonna pull the plug, head big as Hey Arnold's full of blood
Smell the death in the air when we pullin' up
Bullets go B-B-BRRRR, fill 'em up
Bloody murder hollow tips out the clip
I repent when I murder opposites
Pick and roll, stop and pick

And keep your eyes open 'til you start to wheeze out

Hundred for the walkthrough Im not who you talk to
Drive by wet you up, nigga thats a carpool
Spitting all this hot shit, every single bar cool
Diamonds in the rollie face, animated cartoon
Call me Meek Milly I don't play that shit
Got me on my nappy braids before the Maybach clique
Riding in the wheels of fortune, Pat Sajak shit
And all I rock is Balmain like I made that shit
I’ve been, front row fashion week
Looking like I'm in the show
Sitting in the foreign leather, softer than a dinner roll
Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent
We laughing like she been a ho
Chopping up those benzos
Me yo bitch in the friend zone
She told you I was friendzoned, what?
I'm in the endzone
Touchdown with a 2 point conversion
Give her that dick long
She busting like the clip long
Uber to send your bitch home nigga

Feeling sick I gotta fever bitch
In these philly streets situations is
Police ain’t respecting the youth and
The youth ain't respecting the truth and
The Glock 9 on me in the booth and
All I talk is that real shit the truth and

The money turned your bitch into a gold digger
The money got me feeling like the old Jigga
And Jigga even told me you a cold nigga
They ain’t believe me I was broke
But I showed niggas and I told niggas
That I would dispose niggas
Went to buy a pair of sneaks
Landed at the rawest dealer
Brand new paper tag
Haters never made me mad
You get at your baby momma
I’m flyer than her baby dad
Looking at my neck
What that cost? Hundred-eighty cash
Looking at my bitch, she remind me of a Stacey Dash
We was selling rock before Kareem Biggs, Dame and Dash
Oh you think you fly with your lil' dream chasin’ ass?
We don’t chase bitches, we chase money and that [D'ussé]
Cause when you get money, the hoes do whatever you say

A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they ? me

Fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try sell us
Probably why I'm rebellious
To the fraud niggas, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll up and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and you're homie chilling and
You know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
Instead wait for them haters because they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small sucker, I ain't never really around squares
They say it levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bosses
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly that shit cold
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was A1, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't deem me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like ? but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Go ? all bust down, fuck clowns

Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day

Dedicated, de-terminated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking I'm listening
When I be in the jungle the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling, that was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur
I was like told y'all
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's going I got your medulla
? I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he'll probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though ?
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

Ayo
It gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga""
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister, your mother, your father
That shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen you done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them

You sure you want this fame?
You sure you want this power?

Don't let this money bring us down

Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And you main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Meta Peace and Gasol nigga
But i know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
And as long Pop is probably smiling
Imma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

I do not know why they be gassing these suckers but fuck because I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip, that I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose came up from nothing and now they like how he make millions so quick
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches fucking on over
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no Coca
No way

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lords know, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back in the Maybach, ""Shottas"" on
Know all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me that's a chopper zone
Every time you be like [?]
250 thou what I dropped it on
See us niggas [?] 'til Fox be on
Seeing then momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything got my own boxers
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Steady moving on these niggas get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas what they prolly doing
But all I ever hear is what I be doing
All black Rottweiler that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real, don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bently that Bently won't make you trill, pussy
Still hating me from my city I'm thinking its [damn] for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill, they'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma I promise I won't do no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you say you was running this city I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting and you did was talk it you pussy

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom

Meek Mill,"When you go out, you want an obituary or a documentary? Which one you want Khaled?
(I want money)
A documentary, right?
(I want that too!)
We gotta make movies

Bright lights attracted bad bitches
And attracted to mad niggas
Whoever thought lil' ol' Meek Milly'd pass Jigga?
I'm just thinkin' a tad bigger
You niggas talk fly, only fly at your last picture
And you look like the last picture
I just hit a home run, on clash with us
And this money, [?], comin' for the ass, nigga, ass, nigga
Last nigga, there were cemeteries diggin' grass, nigga
The obituary leaves the last scripture
Mama said he was a good kid, thinkin' would kid
I signed my deal with my AP on
In the drop top with the AC on
Stuntin' with Cash Money, get my Baby on
No, never fuck a chick that got Bakers on
Or no Michael Kors
I'm on the same shit that Mike was on
Jordan, Jackson, Tyson on
I've seen niggas your type twice before
I'm in that white velour, look at the flights I bought
These mothafuckin' hoes got a right to war
When a young real nigga light the floor
Hundred black bottles, man that's lights galore
Before Tom was Ford, I'm talkin' Honda Accord
Lookin' for a plug, tryna find the cord
Niggas gettin' shot tryna find the Lord
This bust down Rollie say the time is yours
I get my grindin' on
Like [?] in the [?], it was mayday
Started with a warden, gun until I got an AK
Kids in the projects when we was by the bay, bay
Kids with the Pyrex, I hit it first, Ray J

When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up

I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up

As the rain drop, drop on the pavement
I came through my hood Mulsanne'n
On the block all night like I ain't famous
I still run with the same niggas I came with
Where I came from, where I came in
We eatin' lobster and steak from Top Ramen
Oodles and noodles, when you're hungry them killers'll do you
And when you're gettin' to that money them people pursue you
The Feds lurkin', the streets watchin'
Them hoes talkin', like ""he got it""
And he nervous, cause we plottin'
We call that boy for a burner and we rob him
Like Batman, pussy niggas gettin' backhand
Talkin' to the people you a at man
Half rack, we got more ghosts than Pac-Man
And for that paper we be grindin' like a lapdance
Get the money young nigga
Get the money, never fold, cause they comin' young nigga
When the feds get to rushin', better not tell on young nigga
Don't be selfish young nigga, just man up, don't give the fam up
Facin' 20 years when they added them grams up
Plus 5 more, he got booked with a handgun
And now he in the courtroom, givin' his mans up

Meek Mill,"Was the money good?, Was em bitches bad? Was them fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love?, did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne boils and the campaigns roar
And the lights shine bright every night that plug, for the trillest

See my momma cry too many tears
And we been broke like too many years
It ain't too many kids, a couple homies, there ain't too many there
And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids
To many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids
Too many bids, just gave 'em kids too many years
As soon as you get that money, that's sooner they appear
Some ? as soon as you share
And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family, it ain't the same
I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should've hit the crib with my son and play a game
But instead I ended up at the jeweler to make a chain
It's saying saying when you make money it make you change
Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I made a lane
Shit, I had to walk forward they talkin' 'bout takin' trains
And takin' planes, I put the work in and made a name
But the question is

Was the money good?, Was them bitches bad? was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love?, did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne boils and the campaigns roar
And the lights shine bright every night that plug, for the trillest

I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch
Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this
I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit
Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep that shit
I got blood on my money, ether in my soul
Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?
Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the rose
With the curtains on the windows, I'm just peepin' at my ghost
Money made me iller, already was realer
Young kings killin', young kings over skrilla
That's why I ride around mac on me like I was Miller
Or Reggie when I shoot for that three
They drop fetty, that's good money
Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young
When we get some paper, we cop Prezis ?
20 inch rims for the dope boy
Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy
Got that ? off money, fuck I need a note for!?
In them school hallways like ""fuck I need a note for!?""
We ain't wanna go to class, was sellin' coke raw
The principal was coppa too, hit him with a snowball

Was the money good?, Was them bitches bad? was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love?, did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne boils and the campaigns roar
And the lights shine bright every night that plug, for the trillest

Lookin' for that intro I was at the dealer lookin' for another Benzo
Match kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga
Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo
When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though
Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low
Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go
And they still say I'm arrogant
I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus
When I get that money like I married it
1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it
Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet
Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot
Pull up on 'em niggas that got to me, shit, embarrassin'
I'mma real nigga with money, never trash it
You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison
Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it
And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'
They told me that I couldn't be trap, I started trappin' it
Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is immaculate
I'mma just go sit up in this back again
Smoke the weed and laugh at 'em
Make a couple million by accident
Couple niggas dropped on Twitter say they back again
Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative
Shitted on 'em Nicky voice, did it on 'em Benjamins
Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on 'em a many on a-
Whole 'nother level from before now
Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down
When I made my first mil, I was like ""it's on now""
Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now
Then I made my third mil, I'm like ""I need more now?""
I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down

Meek Mill,"Before this rapping I wanted to be a kingpin
On the corner with niggas running them things in
I was told get the money and bring the team in
And never ever let them hoes get between them
Born a slave, but I die a king, and um
For bad bitches with money, I got a thing and um
I'm feeling like King James when he got his ring
Because I started off with nothing except a dream, nigga
I'm cut from a different cloth
They don't make no more, you niggas soft
The streets killed Lil Snupe, I took a loss
That's why my heart so cold, my shit defrost
Everybody saying that I stunt too much
But they don't know where I came from, I done too much
And my ex chick said I like to fuck too much
So I turned around and told her, ""Bitch you want too much""

What these bitches want from a nigga?
Want from meeeee, want from me
What you want from me? Want from me
I gave it all I got, I won't let you get the best of me, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Look, no one can save us and we realized it
We knew the outcome and we still tried it
That South Central state of mind
I'm in the field, logic to be a real rider
We did this shit to the extreme where you ain't feel honest
Now this blood is on your hands and you hope these bills wash it
Sinking deeper in regret but that's the real faucet
See man, go for self that was the real Slauson
But do this win lose or draw that was a real promise
Till death do us what's most important was rep to us
The set schooled us to love and lie and respect shooters
Reflect to it this year I'm dropping my best music
Hope you niggas get rich and then reinvest to it
Wish you niggas success and minus the stress to it
Lot of steps lot of losses and regrets to it
A game of life you ain't the type that will accept losing
Whatever's left to it flying in a jet to it

What these bitches want from a nigga?
Want from meeeee, want from me
What you want from me? Want from me

You ain't trying to waste no time (no time)
So I gotta let you know (let you know, ohhh)

Money over bitches, that's the story of my life

Tell them keep on trying

Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pictures and serving them addicts

Started with nothin' we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me

I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie 03
I got the plug, he send him up T
Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me
Even though niggas they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down

I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming home, minute on the phone, sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose

I see my niggas disappear at that corner store

Streets talkin' every week the coppers comin' through
And homicides scoopin' niggas out of Paulie crew
Damn, he in some shit just like a number two
So he need that lawyer money, plus that Sig Sauer money
On his second body so you don't want to war with money
Paulie got the word that somebody turned informant on him
Remember when he banged lil' Tony brother spin the corner on him
Maybe its them young niggas, talkin' to the police
Thinking about it every night, ain't been gettin' no sleep
He been spinnin' 'round that same corner for the whole week
Lookin' for them muthafuckers that was there 
With Tony brother when he let the clip roll on 'em
Going crazy thinkin' 'bout who told on him
Time tickin' doors 'bout to close on him
Them boys on the way to see the judge for a warrant
And they got his name on it, tryna put them chains on him
Cold as them streets is, he tryna remain on it
Even though the cops lurkin', got to keep them things on 'em
Layin' low at Kee crib, only when they changed on him
And she givin' info, told where to hit for
Put 'em deep with Tony lil' cousins and his kin folk
Paulie on some other shit, tryna get 'em sent for
Them young nigga bendin' backwards for him like its limbo
And they tryna kill somethin', cops tryna build somethin'
Paulie ain't tryna do no time take a deal, nothin'
Loadin' up his AK banana tryna peel somethin'
Tryna catch a rat nigga slippin' 'fore they spill somethin'
Somebody gon' die
And mommas gon' cry
Before Paulie doin' time
Cause Paulie gon' ride
Back in the field he got his 40 on him
Watchin' out for tinted windows when they pull up on him
He don't even trust the niggas 'round the corner from him
That he grew up with, he done got into it with
Investigatin' niggas if they tellin' or not
And then they feel some time of way he disrespectin' the block
But Paulie don't give a fuck, you disrespect him, you shot
Live by the chopper law and respect of the Glock
Hold up the phone ringin' said they rushin' the spot
The only time he play that crib is when he fuckin' a thot
He was fuckin' with Kee and she was fuckin' an op
But he ain't never think about it, she'll fuck with the cops
She told 'em everything nigga
I know you thought that she'll never sing would you?
Rule number one: keep them bitches from out your business
Rule number two: better kill 'em you know they snitchin'
It's all fun and games 'til them bitches turn to a witness
And know you in the courtroom waiting to get your sentence
Saw you out at Kee crib four in the morn'
Parked up seat low to the floor
She on the way he feel a way, this was one of his whores
And since he been on the run, he been fuckin' em more
Thinkin' about her if she come, open the door
Take a deep breath, I know what I'm doin'
Cause she gon' go to court and she gon' go to them all
And he gon' to jail and she gon' go to the mall
So he started walkin' while she parking
Wasn't even cautious
Parked up on her, had to drive her window out the darkness
He was supposed to shoot her, but he started talkin'
She screamin' out ""I'm pregnant,"" now he thinkin' ""Aw shit""
Started second guessin', that's when them cars spin
Paulie heart dropped he seen the Taurus
So he took off runnin' with the hammer, tried to toss it
Cops shootin' metal slugs rippin' through the car tint
Bullets hit his body while he runnin' and now he fallin'
Damn Paulie, bullet holes
Cuffs on let him bleed
Double murder, attempted murder, yes indeed
If he live, life sentence never leave
If he dies nobody cry for the bad guy
Fronted niggas workin' they the glad guys
Happy they ain't got to pay the tab guys
Paulie make it through to see the trap God
Drownin' in his own blood on his back side
They say he gon' pull through and he gettin' charged too
Lawyer came to see him said he need like 80 large too
Got him in the County Tony people 'hind them walls too
And they say his little cousin crippin' bangin' hard too
And Paulie killed his favorite little cousin back on Part 2
And he can't wait to fall through
Friday they callin' yard too
And Paulie on crutches took the screw up out the 
Handles scrape that bitch 'til it got sharp too

Runnin' like I know they comin' for me

Slaves, on the North side of Philly
Where they tell their mamas
And go spend that money they made on designer
We shoot at our brothers but run from the coppas
In front of Your Honor, beggin' for freedom
If freedom got free in it, why it ain't free then?
We go get a lawyer, a liar, that's descent
To meet with the District Attorney agreement
Like ""take it or leave it, leave it or take it""
If we finna take it, I'm finna go straight for the win
(Winnin', winnin', winnin')
We started as slaves, we came up from nothin'
If I could live twice, I would do it again
Again and again, 'gain and again, huh
Who gon' love your momma on them drugs
Little babies that was never loved
So they run into the corner store
Quarter water only time they get a hug
Get some coca, only time they get some work
Say that it be poppin' on the first
He was poppin' when he had the money
'Til they popped him, now he ridin' in a hearse
This is real shit, nigga, not a verse
People really, really outta work
Kids starving somethin gotta work
Preacher even trappin' out the church
Put them shackles on my arm and leg
All them days made my body hurt
Locked my brothers all up in the cage
So we turn to prayer, hoping God will work

Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free

I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin' a move
Said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord

Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need 'em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, ""He's a fool""
They told us that this was cool

Caught my first case, it was me versus the state
I just wanted some steak and some food on my plate
Came up from shit I'm like ""how can you hate""
I'm just tryna be great, I survived with the snakes
Look what they did to Lil' Kodak and Gates'
I can't lose faith, I just want shine like the stars in my Wraith
We go to war in fatigues like it's Bape
I don't feel safe, can't sleep without it
Master with them P's yeah boy I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Brought me to my knees back when everybody doubted
Can't let my youngins see me fold, I'm too solid
If I stand on it, I'ma stand on it
Put some bags on the scale, put some grams on it
This the only shit I knew I seen my man done it
Tryna be like niggas who were never there for us
We ain't have no guidance

Cut the lights, told my momma they ain't stayin' off
They killed my daddy and it turned me to a man, dog
We play with Rrugers, play with Glocks, we ain't playin ball
Shit we tryna stay alive it's a standoff
My life for your life
Go to war like we got like four lives
Talkin' before like, all this lil' rap shit

Meek Mill,"Real talk, so when my nigga Meek caught his case I went to visit him
I'm walking up to the jail, all the niggas start repping
Beating on glass, kicking the doors, and shit
So when I walk through the door, the captain tell me you can't come in here
Ok, cool
Came back two weeks later, I got access
Soon as I got on the cell block I heard it all the way from down the hallway
My nigga had on yellow Balenciagas, ha ha ha

Dreaming of things we can't afford
But now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now
I bet they say, ""He put his niggas on""
Now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh

Corners wanna check him like Odell Beckham
I could play a record or just draw the weapon
She know I'm living reckless looking at my necklace
I'mma blow this forty on me, you can save the lectures
Homicides rise as the sun falls
Watch your dog die as my gun bark
These helicopters rise for the one in charge
If I sentence you to die well that's a hundred shots
Judge banging like a blood, show a nigga love
Caught him with a kilo so he hit him with a dub
We bulletproof the trucks like the ones in Iraq
Where I'm at you lock your door and you using a latch
Now it's stones on my hands, Roberto Durans
Stood tall in the feds, don't fold on the fam
Tryna point me to the money, no holding my hand
Somebody take me to the bank 'cause it open at ten

Poverty stricken, boy you gotta be kidding
Living like we hit the lottery nigga
I been tippin' since Scottie was Pippen, Chad was sippin'
And before I had that bag I used to bag them bitches
I'm so cocky and I'm confident
All these killers in my ambiance
Say what I want, nobody's stoping it
Get off my dick nigga
Where you was at when I could've died for this?
Or die for that, real nigga roger that
Said I took a loss but I got it back, woo
Me and all my dogs sell a lot of that food
Talking to the law, knowing that it's not cool
Make me shoot a rapper like my name was Bennie Boom
Started out with nothing, now a nigga in a room
Sweeping rich bitches off they feet like a broom
Double-M G bitch, you know how we move
Whole lot of choppers nigga, I could never lose

I was amazed
Oh how it turned their heads
I mastered the game
Oh how they raised their hands
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
Oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors

I seen this years ago
Picasso on the wall

Like Lamborghini doors

Paintings on the wall, you never know the cost
You banging on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse
I'm stepping through the door, my back against the wall
My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall
Love to see a pretty bitch rolling a wood leaf
Phone ringing, smiling like I got some gold teeth
I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese
I left a chick in NBC out on the NorthEast
Such a feeling, niggas killing for my poetry
Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me
I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny
At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him
You niggas out of style with your wedding vows
I still be making rounds like I'm Kevin Liles
Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out
Them Lamborghini doors, you see me stepping out

Started off poor with plans to own more
To riding under stars, the life we lived for
Dreaming of things we can't afford
But now we coming up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now

Tell a nigga ""No"", and they gon' show you who they really is
Trappin' since little kid, did a little bid, 
But I bounced back like the bullet did when it ricocheted, hit the little kid
This what it is, when the ice cream truck come through
Ain't have a dollar, that shit just made me to a boss
Word to my father, woah

When you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies
Had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you break
This the price of being great
This the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you pray
This the price of being great

Yeah, ain't no price on the money
Ain't no price in the Lord
I got outta the system, I jumped right on the Forbes
When I got out the ghetto, I jumped right on the tour
When I stunt on that Instagram, I'm just showing them more
I'm just showing them better see how to make it through any weather
Back when I said I would make it they was telling me never
Only get one chance better take it, only one shot, boy, you betta
How you survive in the jungle, he be movin' so clever
I'm talkin' tooly Beretta to make it back to my son
Talkin' crab in the barrel, they pull you back where I'm from
That's why we loadin' extendos up in the back of the gun
Posted up on that corner see the paddy wagon, we run, whoa

When they killed my nigga Snupe, I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies it's goin' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'mma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the clear port ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands every time I walk in
If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)
But mama I got thirty in this dirty .40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
'Cause this the type of money get your lined up
And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but ain't nobody roll 'bout him
Three felonies, ain't graduate, no I am not your role model

I hope the lord got us
When they killed my nigga, I seen the footage on the tape
Man I must've threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like he's Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food, tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough
And I'm throwing through stuff, I don't feel no love
And I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking perkys, man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone
I wan' see my brother with the Patek not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah yeah, these challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip, accurate
And I'm leaning like a project banister
I'm a boss, I ain't never need a manager

You gotta be possessed with the dream

Young nigga started with oodles and noodles, now we eating lobster

Uh, as I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap

So I went and bought me a don and flipped that hat to the back

New jewelry, new whips on the way now

Streets calling and they said they was some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick

I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to kill me, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different
I'm like lord be my witness 'cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Killed a pigeon thought the vision, break it down on my niggas
Fuck their opinions, why would I listen, they ain't see the vision, 
When I had foreign, I mentioned no, I ain't see them bitches 
So I'mma ball on 'em, Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas staying down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah, my nigga bad for Milli he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's peak
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping sixty-twos like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches
Top of the food chain, head of comission
We breaking niggas without permission
Never was personal, it was business
Brrr, settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke, fuck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round, got a gun that hold a hundred rounds

Felons on your records so them jobs ain't gettin' back at you
Them kids ain't eat yet, so you can't even sleep yet
That's the only thing we ever saw, we repeat that
They was playing ball, fouled him hard, said I'd be back
Broad day, threw his life away, soon as he clapped
Gave that boy a life sentence, made his mama relapse

Comin' from the bottom, it's so hard to make a plan

Talkin' 'bout all these niggas, how they ain't even with him
Said that they would ride or die, but it ain't even in 'em
Always postin' on the 'Gram, but hey ain't sendin' pictures
Never answer when you call, but answer for them bitches
Got you thinking twice, damn I should've been a witness
Dismantle my business, just telling my story
All guts, no glory, been going on before me
We slaves in the Forties, still slaves in the present
No toys for Christmas, ain't get us no presents
Only made us evil, made us hungry, made us desperate
Youngin' in the ninth grade, he got a Smith and Wesson
Grew up with the goons, now he need protection
He dropped outta school, then he got arrested
Lord with a blessing, I just hope he learned his lesson
They told us, if we go to jail, we would be respected
They told us, if we make a sale, we would run a check in
Threw a rock out in that field, he got intercepted
He stumbled, he fumbled, y'all niggas just rumble
They told you to hustle, them niggas don't love you

He's talking about
Immigration, as we know it

Meek Mill,"How I keep from goin' under?
It's like a jungle outside
Sometimes I wonder how I keep from goin' under

We scream, ""Black Lives Matter,"" but we still toting ladders
Watching our own brothers trying to get at us
Dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers
And they charge you with some shit you ain't do
You like, ""what happened?""
We go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk
They told us to hate each other before we learn how to walk
Mama taught you how to fight, fight, before she taught you how to write, right
And daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night
Monsters under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night
Coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight
And you catchin' contact, but never mind that
In a world where Black is wrong and white right, it's like a combat
We go to war for our freedom, they say we equal
I used to wanna play like Randall and be an Eagle
I used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver
That was 'til the ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement
It's amazin', this environment we was raised in
On them papers, one mistake and I'm gettin' caged in
You gotta feel me, feel like the system tryna kill me
Got arrested and the charges F1 for popping wheelies, stay woke

It was designed for us to fail
We still prevail through the hell, yeah
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated
Though it's designed for us to lose
We still make it through, nothing's impossible
Believe it, we're still undefeated

Picture me ten years younger with some tats on my face
Takin' a bunch of Xannys with the strap on my waist
Pointin' it at the camera like mama ain't teach me manners
Tryna see mo' bills like I'm headed to Alabama, no, wait
I can't judge them, I'm just trying to understand them
'Cause I used to pop Percs, pourin' purple in my Fanta
Had me swerving in my Phantom like I'm runnin' from my dreams
I was headed for the slammer, I was plantin' all the seed
For them to bury me, I had my whole family mad at me
Fell deep in love with the game and it married me
Judge said, ""I'll give you a chance, just don't embarrass me""
Motivatin' these little niggas is like a charity
Community service even though they knew we was workin'
They did this to me on purpose, 'cause I ain't movin' too perfect
I stay away from them clowns, watch how I move through the circus
'Cause they be weighing you down, even some of them dudes in your circle, stay woke

Though it's designed for us to fail, yeah
We still prevail through the hell, yeah
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated
Though it's designed for us to lose
Nothing, nothing, nothing's impossible, no
Believe it, we're still undefeated

How can I pledge allegiance to the flag
When they killin' all our sons, all our dads?
I come from a place, when you kill your own brother you can brag
Like he got bodies, but that's a fad, no, that's a fact
You screamin' out at your corner, nigga, that's a trap
Screamin' out at your homie, nigga, that's a rat
Catch a case with him, bet he crack
The odds against you and they double stacked, stay woke
Bought my mom a new crib, that's some gangster shit
Niece and nephews walking 'round wearing minks and shit
Kept the hood motivated, this the thanks I get?
Try to Ja Rule the kid on some Wanksta shit
But that's impossible 'cause I'm unstoppable
The label can't drop me, nigga, I'm too valuable
You thought I would lose but I won and that bothered you
Still movin' 'round in Philly just like the mobsters do
When I talked to Em and Hov, they said, ""I'm proud of you
You stood tall back when everyone doubted you""
My reply is, ""I did what I gotta do
And I need that verse 'fore you retire too""
Jumping all the obstacles, I'm way too wavy
Said I would lose boy you way too crazy
Pick and choose either fame or the money, fame will make you crazy
And the money will make them bad bitches say, ""Thank you, baby""

The other half will fear me 
Shit both halves will make one whole 
But nothing can dare those cowards to come near me

I'm a nightmare, the nigga that's always right there

Better act like you know or get smacked like your hoe 
When you straped, toe to toe, but can't strap with the flow 
And I gets down for mine, with the crime 
And if I gots to do time, fuck it 
I don't mind 
I handle my business and I shoot snitches

That mad scheme to get cream without the job

After all this shit I did, never thought that I'd be rappin' one day

Uh, uh, uh
[Verse 2 [Meeno]:]
Never Thought I'd have a Benz
Fo' ?V twizzy?, when a dime's on a ?D-Throw?
You know the tinks
Never thought a nigga like me would cheat in the game
Taxfree money, still get a seat in the change
Never Thought of bein' taught, with me deep in the game
On the other side of the town with these weak ass lames
Never wanted to see ""Live On Lenox""
Vacant Lot
Foot ya'll niggas, my crew will make it hot
Def to a man that saved a lot
We do it all for the love of the kids, love of the block
Want to start me poppin', love it or not
I've been through a lot of Bullshit and you thought I forgot
Gotta get whut you deserve and I owe you a lot
Cause we the ballin' niggas
Hard to fall niggas
Ready when it's time for thoughts, you cored niggas
Sendin' this shit out to all ya'll niggas
Want to know whut we about, we ball on niggas
Vacant Lot, 99, Fuck ya'll

[Chorus]
Verse 3 [Baby Madison]:
Who would ever thought I woulda switch games
I thought all this crack money I gain
And all the cold nights hustlin' in the rain
Still runnin' from the cops
Game don't stop
Want to restin' til' they catchin', I'ma had it the game
Back my coke to blast
Nigga rubbers' been on my nuts
The free work is on the block
I ain't tryna get knocked
Supplyin' with the light tops with plastic glocks
I'ma ball til' I drop whether you like it or not
When it's on, so they dump, blamin' on Vacant Lot
We niggas makin' it hot, we about to drop
Talk slick and blow ?droh?, I be blazin' tribes
Watch your mouth and your man ?off? I be diffin' the back
Grimmy niggas lay back, slingin' raps like crack
House full of Platinum Plaques, I did it at last
Dirty money to green cash, to the best throw wacks
And if you can't except it, then nigga respect it
Number One on Billboards, better run and check it
Uh!

If I die, just look to the sky
I ain’t even gon’ lie, tell my niggas don’t cry 'bout nothing
If there’s something on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk, getting high with my guys, didn't care 'bout nothing

Ever since they first hit me up, wasn't supposed to live
Still on the block getting money where I’m supposed to live
They want to see my casket shine, hope mama front row
Tears in her eyes, heart bleeding, the boy have to go
I can see Puff telling Ross, Yela was a legend
I can see my baby-mama mad, it ain't fresh
And I be mad
Turning up for my nigga 'till they put me in the casket

Sucks hanging, we just some young niggas
Out the bottom, got it from crumbs nigga
Now it’s 250 in the slum nigga
Pocket full and this shit for fun nigga
Say never know
All this shit a nigga seen, I’ll never fold
May never know
Niggas claiming like a lawyer, probably telling though
Young niggas out here, let the blammer go
Mixing mud with the smoke, I’m paranoid
Got a couple kittens that’s down to go
And when they come, I’ll be there mining coal
Suckas living a lie
Out here blessing all my niggas and I’m living the life
Got a couple foreign bitches and they put up a fight
If I told you what I know, I’m probably doing a life
Fuck these fuck-niggas, we don’t run with 'em
Hating bitches man, I’m done with 'em

Look, rose up out that dirt wearing holy clothes
Most niggas love to hate you, man, you don’t need those niggas
How we gon’ cleanse our body of these sins?
When our only concern was re-ing up and riding rims
Sold white that wasn’t good for cooking
Teacher used to say that I’d amount to nothing
Kept the work up in that kitchen cupboard
Whipped it like I baked it in that easy oven
Everybody pick their poison, Islamic or Christian
Buddhas to Jewish, every religion is Judas
Nigga due to all my circumstances
Had no choice but roll the dice, had to take the chances
'Till my homies leave the can, they just tuna fish
No money orders from the fam, just get through the shit
Youngins dying nowadays, dressed-up in the ghetto
The struggle all by the system, these crackers turn you Gepetto
I’m loading up in that hoopty to catch a 187
I flipped and got me a Rolex, preacher got the same Bezel
What the fuck, some nights I couldn’t sleep 'cause Satan woke me up
Been through shit that make you cry, have you choking up
Find yourself in the darkest places loading them nines
Tryna grip your mind, searching, you search what you find
Came up with jack-shit up out that wishing well
Left with this black skin and a digital scale
I pray I be okay when I grow up a little bigger

And for you haters out there, pay attention

You don't want no problem, you don't wanna mess with it
How I put it down I come around, niggas already be knowing already who be the best with it
How I step all up in the spot every time you see a nigga fresh step with a little fresh fitted
Bust every bottle in the building and I fuck shit up
I got 'em whilin' 'til a nigga tell he finished
(You weak jealous motherfuckers) You see them gather closer
Pretty white bitches be linin' up like bricks of coca
Make it bounce, stretch and spread yo' ass, yoga
Bangin' on niggas until we probably break a shoulder
I don't ever give a fuck what it cost, see, the money I'ma toss
Make way homie, see we coming through a little bit
Illiterate, but you know you fuckin' with a boss
Yeah we takin' over small countries where they don't know us like ""Yo, who that?""
While we go and hit 'em with the shit that make 'em wanna raise up, uh-uh, don't do that
Tired of telling niggas when you know exactly what I'm on
Get this bread, bakery, cake up little nigga then I'm gone
Y'all see the way I black out every time I beat 'em in the head 'til the nigga run along like

You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga

And see her tell me she left shit in my telly

To make everyone drop when I bust toys when they suck soy
I'm gonna get my paper no matter what
Hateful takers don't got enough, they goin' a nut
Get a fo'-fo' with ya ganja holdin' my do' in the cut
Play no games and I ain't no dame so I aim for pain
I'ma drain yo' brain when that thang go bang
Like I'm Django, man, and my aim goes bang
When I'm faced with jealousy, all the states throw mail at me
So it's making you march, wanna yell at me
When I react they call up Penelope's
Bitch ass, trick ass, sniff ass, ho
Just 'cause I get cash when I spit fast, now his ass low
Go get a sick pass and a bitch badge 'cause you get mad, bro
You 'bout to get flagged and you wondering if it's riff raff, no nigga

Mefe,"Llegan mis palabras, no seré la profeta con las tablas
Sólo alguien con algo que decir, para los que odian
Para los que temen, para los que no se atreven existe un lugar
Mientras analizas a otros les llegan las prisas
La vida se acaba como una sonrisa en un vagón del metro
Falto a la cita, misterios explica, déjame desnudarme 
Toda esta ropa me pica
Vamos a quedarnos mirando por la ventana 
Para imaginar que todo sea así mañana
Déjame abrazar la mama
Pa ver si soluciona sus problemas de existencialidad
Debe ser difícil entenderme, no hablamos el mismo idioma
Pero entre cada punto y cada coma está mi alma
Eso no necesita traducción, el mejor perfume es nuestra esencia

Prima, no te sientas así
Donde quiera que vayas sabes que te llevo aquí
Prima, no te preocupes si yo sé que tú me quieres y yo 
Te quiero a tí

Estar alejada de la familia es difícil
Pero tú y yo sabemos que no hay crisis 
Cuando existe real conexión de todo corazón, 
Le damos forma a la misma conexión, you feel it!
Así como milímetros mueven kilómetros
Kilómetros se transforman en centímetros
Sentimiento plano, música y te siento, te noto
Cuando cae fase y da comienzo realidad
No hay oscuridad que se oculte tras verdad
No hay engaño, luz alumbra de verdad
La esencia pura y de energía sólo va variando
Y aunque a veces dude sé de dónde voy y dónde vengo
Y que haciendo el camino pronto nos encontraremos, ten fé! 
El tiempo es sólo una excusa que inventamos pa crecer

Ah, ah, hasta tus tobillos
Óyeme, hasta tus tobillos
Eh, eh, hasta tus tobillos
¿Cómo? hasta tus tobillos

Deja de insistir, si no pueden elegir
Por mí tú no te frenes si yo me caigo avanza
Cuántas vidas equilibran la balanza
Sabes que aquí me tienes llenita de esperanza
Lo mismo 20, 30, 40, yo no me fallo, ¿de qué me sirve?

Por eso que tropecé, por eso que me caí
Por eso que levanté, por eso que ya entendí
Por eso es que hoy volví hasta aquí pa decirte",Prima,2010
Meg,"Two hearts that shouldn't
Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell

People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen, anyone would listen

You come from a town where
People don't bother saying hello
Unless somebody's born or dies

And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved

Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the next life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you

His first words.
Were his last verse.

I need that moment back.

Ivories that sliced sedatives in half.
Relief in Rhine.
Washed away regrets.
And let him char before he caressed the ground.
Dear artist you will rise again.
A last arabesque in faint fashion.

I often loose track
So I took a drag
Of my first cigarette
And I found my head
Roll down the dumps
Of twenty seventh street

I drew a sketch
With lipstick and sidewalk
Of Newports edge
Legoblock cliffs
And an ocean that doesn't
Deserve the sounds of silence
I'd swear on a dead artists grave

I found a spot
Where the drunk never got to
And it rocks me gently silent, silent
If I never surface
Then it doesn't matter
Hold my breath
It's silent, silent, now

Diligent
Escape by the water
Not sick of it
It only gets harder
That's no excuse
To block all the cliches and
Reason for kicks

Both sitting on sand
And her shoulders bare
Nothing to demand of them
Laying back on a lonely stone wall
And passersby look passed it all

I found a spot
Where the drunk never got to
And it rocks me gently silent, silent
If I never surface
Then it doesn't matter
Hold my breath
It's silent, silent

Where the drunk never got to
It rocks me gently silent, silent
If I never surface
Then it doesn't matter
Hold my breath
It's silent, silent, now",Santa Barbara,2006

Not because I'm hurt, that's just what it tastes like
Dirt roads, remind me of my skin
Not because I'm wasting away
With the gravel you grounded, that's what it feels like

I won't be sorry, won't go moping around
In fact I'm doing quite well for now

Let's talk about giving up, that sounds so bitter sweet
Think I'll throw in the towel right now
I'll lay low on the ground and I'll be on my feet
When I can breathe, when I'm good and ready

This tree, lovers heart engraved
Not because I'm lonely, just because I hate it
Sunshine lives underneath my nose
Not because I'm burning all my hopes
Scorching all my favors, far as I can turn

And I'm not bitter, I'm not mouthing out words
Look at my face, believe me now

You rule the world. 
You give the word
And if someone should fall behind
Just let their suffering slip your mind.

Are there giants too, in the dance?
Cause this is about life and life isn't about death.
Are there giants too, in the dance?

I wonder who decides who wins?
In which we nod in agreement
Who let these sublime people in?

Were unaware that diamonds came with debt.
Ironic sure, but that's the way it is,

Why not?

'll pray for you and cash flow too, why not?

It was a black wedding,
You could hear the organs not,
The violins or the words the pope was saying.
It was a black wedding,

While most prayed they wouldn't last a winter.
It was a black wedding,
With those blessings all around.

So,
You're finally viewing this at five foot six.
It's not all roses like your mama said,
We're not spoon fed anymore.
So you gonna tell
All our kids I was an accident?
Ironic true,
But that's the way you act when you're upset
So let's take this outside.

We see our mirrors from outside,
And he said we are only pride,
We stay hidden all our lives.

I wish that I would have known better.
Better love makes a fat romance,
That lasts for more than a shoe shine.
I'm older, took all the words of my mother, saying,
It could be worse,
Could be born with that disease,
Instead of catching it first.
So lets go back, to the first time,
That I met you, in your Chevy,
With your hands stretched,
And me crying, screaming, Mercy. Mercy.
But I know that, I was put here, to fight Vikings
In the cold war, with my arms out,
In the front lines, singing, Dare me. Dare me.

But these things take time love.
These things take backbone.
And they'll tell you what you want to hear
Cause they think its better. Better.
But you better know how to point out the liars.
You've got to weigh your wars make sure
You're not fighting for nothing. Nothing.
Are you fighting for nothing?

It feels like this world has been
Growing slowly upside down.
Maybe I should move to China,
And straighten this mess out.
Maybe Ill be a poet.
Watch all the sky for falling words.
And write about my grandmas curtains,
Or the lady who put the Chinese buffet in her purse.
I've got my mouth.
Its a weapon. Its a bombshell.
Its a cannon. I've got my words.
I won't give them mercy. Mercy.

I've got my words. I hope they hurt you.
I hope they scar you. I hope they heal you.
I hope they cut you open,
Make you see you've been warring
For all the wrong reasons.

Make you see that some things are worth bruising for.
Make you see that your name is your honor code.
Make you see that your hands you're accounted for.
Pick and choose where your sweat and your blood will go.
Make you see your life's not to be lived alone.
Run their spit through your hair,
You're worth nothing.
Nothing.

Meg Boscov,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart,2006
Meg Boscov,"You're nearer than my head is to my pillow
Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below
Precious as the sun to the things that grow

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so

Meg Christian,"Listen baby, ain't no mountain high, 
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough; 
Baby if you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name;  I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me,
Some way, some how.
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.

Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand,
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can.
Don't you know that there
 
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
No wind no rain or winters cold can stop me baby,
'Cause you are my goal.
If you're ever in trouble;
I'll be there on the double.
Just send for me, oh baby.
 
If you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;

And the room and I hung on your every word
And you burned off that rain
Burned off the smallness of my town
And October seemed to pale beside you

Held on with one hand to that bar
Now I hate to speak of magic
But what other words do I have to tell you?
For the record I knew
As for my ""Diamonds & Rust""
Well I don't feel damned no I feel blessed
Yeah I feel blessed

If these strings they can recall
Than I pray that they will show me
Pressed into the hollow of your fingers
And the hollow of my throat
If you spend your days doing what you love
Than love it seems comes easily
Now I feel blessed, yeah I feel blessed

And the girls hung on your arm
And they pulled out all their charm
And you shook each and every hand 

And then were gone
It's like your blessed
Oh it's like your blessed

These songs they came my way
At a time in which I questioned
The value of what we do
Between impending war and unpaid bills

Meg Hutchinson,"Bridge just south of town
They've been working on it for years now
Just about finish up 'fore it occurs to anyone
They built that damn thing just about a foot off the ground
Way way higher than the road around
So if you happen down that highway, 'specially at night
Hit the bridge at fifty-five
Feel like you might just take flight
And every time the crossing comes as a surprise
See my flying

I've found quiet in this room
Down by where the trains run
I've learned to hear the rumble, long before it
comes
And the things I'm working on
Are invisible to everyone
Something 'bout an empty hip or the angle of the sun
Every time the crossing comes as a surprise
See me flying

Maybe these stitches in my throat
Have just about dissolved
Like the sad moan of the drunkard
walking home from the bar
I hear the thin song of the fire house
when they sound the alarm
I hear the church bells on Sunday... ringing out

Used to be a town of dirt and horses
Now it's all liquor and cars
There's still a whole lot of nothing
up between those stars
Take the dog out for a walk
On the Episcopal church lawn

To get ourselves beyond
And every time the crossing comes as a surprise

I want to walk down streets with strangers everywhere
want to hear jazz on Tuesdays and have a life
'bout which no one cares
want to wear a tiny red dress and taste the city air

I can see it in my mind
I guess one good thing about being young
Is I've got all kinds of time

Chorus:

I want to find a place to stay
With pretty boys in cafes
I want to sing all morning above the screaming of the subway
I want to walk and walk and walk until I lose my way
want to forget all about you for one whole day . . .
I want more

Maybe one day my name in lights
Even my skin can't hold me tight
I feel much too wild for this country night

We're 'bout as happy as babies can be
What if I find that I'm caught in a storm?

And baby's bound to keep me warm

So much together you'd count us as one
Tell old man worry to go climb a tree
'Cause I'm with my baby, I've got my baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
A dream of a duo now don't you agree
Why keep it mum when there's nothing to hide?
And what I feel I must reveal
It's more that I can keep inside

And I can assure you it won't go away
Let me assure you it grows every day
I was a one once but now I'm a we
'Cause I got my baby, dear little baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
Facing the world optimistically
Nothing can stop us so nobody try
'Cause baby's rough and full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I

Get out of our way, folks and give us some room
Watch how we bubble and blossom and bloom

Got a little motto
Always sees me through

Mama's good to you

There's a lot of favors
I'm prepared to do
You do one for Mama
She'll do one for you

They say that life is tit for tat
And that's the way I live
So, I deserve a lot of tat
For what I've got to give

Don't you know that this hand
Washes that one too?
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you

If you want my gravy
Pepper my raggoo
Spice it up for Mama
She'll get hot for you

When they pass that basket
Folks conribute too
You put in for Mama
She'll put out for you

The folks a top the ladder
Are the ones the world adores
So boost me up my ladder kid
And I'll boost you up your's

Let's all stroke together
Like the Princeton crew
When you're strokin' Mama
Mama's strokin' you

So what's the one conclusion?
I can bring this number to
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you

Meg Lee Chin,"Jesus said "" Lay down your arms, Jesus said ""Children come home""
I saw the best minds of my generation running on empty, Superglued to the T.V.,
Dreaming of prosperity, Talking incessantly, Saying nothing
Sleeping on platforms at train stations, Sipping chemical cocktails,
Alive to the Universe, Dead to the World.
Hallucinating delusions of media reality in Camden Town, Desperate in the pursuit of cool
He's in a suit, she's in a straight jacket, 7-11 nightmares at 3am and the moon is quiet and holy.
Watch all the bridges collide, Well I think we might have to lay low, for a while
I saw the best minds of my generation caught up in the virtual reality of living
Memorizing pin numbers and secret codes,
Swaying robotically to non-existent rhythms, Flashing memberships to clubs so exclusive nobody belongs,

Mirror-eyed shades stalk the planet whisper riddles
Jealous one eyed lovers like to fidget while you fiddle,
Then a wall of crumpled nothing tumbles down till you surrender
To the cost of making lovers out of princes and pretenders

From a cast of bittered thousands gilded, rusted golden cage,
Silver spoonz that lick their bottomz open up the bird's eye view

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

Megadeth,"Forgive me father for I have sinned 
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind 
And I'm still wide awake... Mary Jane 
From the earth up through the trees 
I can here her calling me 
Her voice rides on the breeze 
Oh, it's haunting me 
No, I can't get away 
No, there's no escape 
If I know I'm going crazy 
I must not be insane 
Beware my friends as you pass by 
As you are now so once was I 
As I am now so you must be 
Prepare my friends to follow me 
Forgive me father for I have sinned 
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind 
Fingers gripped around my brain 
No control, my mind is lame 
I'm in the astral plane and I'll never be the same 
Never, never... never 
Beware my friends as you pass by 
As you are now so once was I 
As I am now so you must be 
Prepare my friends to follow me 
It hurts so bad I can't breathe 
Prepare to follow me

Megadeth,"""I just want to set the world afire"" 
Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky 
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie 
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb 
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun 
Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999 
Weeds once underneath the feet have grown to vines 
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face 
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late 
The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid of they said 
And if it comes the living will envy the dead 
Racing for power and all come in last 
No winning, first stone cast 
This falsehood worldly peace 
Its treaties soon will cease 
No one will be left to prove that humans existed 
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted 
We all live on one planet and it will all go up in smoke 
Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy 
And now the final scene, a global darkening 
Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruin 
Towering overhead both far and wide 
There's unknown tools for World War III 
Einstein said, 'We'll use rocks on the other side' 
No survivors, set the world afire!",Set the World Afire,1988
Megadeth,"Thermal count is rising in perpetual writhing
The primordial ooze and the sanity they lose
Awakened in the morning to more air-pollution warnings
Still we sleepwalk off to work as our nervous systems jerk
Pretending not to notice how history has forbode us
With the greenhouse in effect our environment was wrecked
Now I can only laugh as I read our epitaph
We end our lives as moles in the dark of the dawn patrol",Dawn Patrol,1990
Megadeth,"Bestow upon me knowledge 
Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise 
I want to rule my kingdom 
Make sweet the breeze, not once defiled 
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists in velvet gloves of sin 
Parade the grey-robed monks, the vestal virgins 
And wheel the wyvern's in 
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage 
Let me be the protege of five magics 

Give me alchemy! 
Give me sorcery!
Give me wizardry! 
Thermatology! 
Electricity! 

Magic if you please 
Master all of these 
Bring him to his knees 
I master five magics 
Possessed with hellish torment 
I master magics ""5""

Only one will stay alive 
He who lives by the sword will surely also die 
He who lives in sin will surely live the lie",Five Magics,1990
Megadeth,"Welcome to our fortress tall
Take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen to much
Hangar 18 I know too much

Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military Intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen to much
Hangar 18 I know too much",Hangar 18,1990
Megadeth,"Sitting up, late at night
I tiptoe through the darkness
Cold as hell, black as spades
Aware of my immediate surrounding
In my place I escape up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone
My friends all say,
""Dave you're mental anyway"" hey!
Drift into a deeper state
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits between my feet
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak

Hypnosis guides my hand
I slipside through the walkways
Sit in granny's rockin' chair
Memories are whirling by, yeah
Reminisce in the attic
Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint
The cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky
The crystal ball's energized
Surely that like the cat waiting
Lucretia rocks away",Lucretia,1990
Megadeth,"I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me

A snake you were when me met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away

Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain
Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in
Never knowing if I'd wake up in a whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood in a cesspool, I became dead
From a rock star to a desk fool was my destiny, someone said
Love's a tidepool, taste the waters, life's abundant
Taste me",Poison Was the Cure,1990
Megadeth,"Tremble you weaklings,cower in fear
I am your ruler,land,sea and air
Immense in my girth,erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system locked in on military gluttons

I rule on land,air and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warning,only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head,to spit into the wind

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris,the end doesn't scare us

When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace
Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Survival such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns,your flesh creeps

High priest of holocaust,fire from the sea
Nuclear winter spreading disease
The day of final conflict
All pay the price
The third world war
Rapes peace,takes life
Back to the start,talk of the part
When the earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days where black as night

Eradication of earth's
Population loves Polaris",Rust in Peace...Polaris,1990
Megadeth,"Got one chance, infiltrate them
Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, detriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Burn

Going to war,give'em hell
D-Day, next stop Normandie
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A heaven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul

Love and war they say all is fair
Take his life
But won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you & me
It's a funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit",Take No Prisoners,1990
Megadeth,"This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up,I wanted to cry
But dammit,this well's gone dry
Not for the money,not for the fame
Not for the power,just no more games
But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies,that let a 1000 days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado,blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years,not from the use
Not from the tears,just self abuse

Who's to say,what's for me to say...be...do
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep,I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true to late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death",Tornado of Souls,1990
Megadeth,"Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand

Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand

The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homelands

Holy wars

Upon my podium, as the
Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die, they die

They killed my wife, and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes

Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
Because I don't say it,
Don't mean I ain't thinkin' it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings

You'll serve only me
And my will to kill
You will kill for me

All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your master

A soul mate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name

She will be your bride
She will serve me too
And I will introduce you to

Megadeth,"Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug the picture fades
And as my body decays
Mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates
The silk within my coffin lays
Go to hell!
As they bury me now
Six feet there my body lies
Still feel like I'm going down
I hear a distant wailing cry
God something must've gone wrong
And much too late I realize
Go to hell!
I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgment was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friend's the goat
With 666 between his horns
Go to hell!
Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
And as Charon sails the sea
Your journey too shall end below
Ah yes, you're all sitting ducks
It's true you reap what you sow
Go to hell!
Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll go to Hell for Heaven's sake",Go to Hell,1991
Megadeth,"A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes. 
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies. 
A little man with a big eraser, changing history 
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees. 
Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue. 
Make a person disappear and no one will ever miss you. 
Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was. 
Eliminates incompetence and those who break the laws. 
Follow the instructions from the New Way's Evil Book of Rules. 
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools. 
You say you've got the answers, well, who asked you anyway? 
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way? 
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come. 
I believe my kingdom will come. 
F is for fighting, R is for red 
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed. 
E, we elect them, E, we eject them, 
In the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
D for your dying, O, your overture, 
M, is for money, you know what that cures 
They will cover your grave with manure. 
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me, 
As long as there's a PMRC. 
Put your hand right up my shirt, 
Pull the strings that make me work, 
Jaws will part, words fall out,
