Jerry Orbach,"When the midnight choo choo leaves for Alabam'
I'll be right there, I've got my fair
When I see that rusty haired conductor man
I'll grab him by the collar and I'll holler ""Alabam' Alabam'""

That's where you stop your train, that brings me back again 
Down home where I'll remain, where my honey lamb am 
I will be right there with bells, when that old conductor yells
""All aboard! All aboard! All aboard for Alabam'""",There's No Business Like Show Business [From Annie Get Your Gun],2007

Jerry Orback,"There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought?
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known?
Well, who indeed?

And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own?
It's so peculiar
We'll wait and see

A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

You know perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before
There may be something there that wasn't there before",Something There,2009
Jerry Orchestra Bresler,"Because they told me I can't behold ye till weddin' music starts playin'
To ease my longin' there's nothin' wrong in my standin' out here and sayin'
Come to me, bend to me, kiss me good day!
Darlin', my darlin', 'tis all I can say
Jus' come to me, bend to me, kiss me good day!
Give me your lips an' don't take them away
Come, dearie, near me so ye can hear me, I've got to whisper this softly

Jerry Peal,"A rainy drive, on a long straight highway
Can 'cause time to lose it's meaning
And the mind to wander far from the act of driving
Interruptions at every curve, no longer jangle against your nerves
A rainbow bridge is not far away

Now you're standing on the steps of a fountain
On a hot summer's day
Running along a tree-lined pathway
Slowing your pace until you feel
Your heart beats in rhythm to the first light of day

Now you're running down a mountain
In the cool blue shade
A waterfall where you lift your head
Colors cascade from green to red
And the fireflies that dance, when the light is fading

You drift away on the night ride
With eyes that dream as much as they see
The wind in the willows winding through the grass
The drawbridge of consciousness is lifted at last
Where are you going?",Dreaming With Open Eyes,1999
Jerry Peal,"12 years old in Amsterdam in 1939
A blue-eyed boy, my clean complexion always got me by
A boy with real potential, sold secrets by the score
Where refugees were hiding I'd just point out the doors

In the golden age of steam I learned those German songs
I had to stay alive, there was no right or wrong
In the golden age of steam

The fatherland was rising the world would hear the roar
Both sides fed and trusted me in 1944
Trains ran on time those days oiling the machine
Smoke rose up like serpents, I was barely seventeen
In the golden age of steam

It's over now but not somehow
I was a hero then to many men
Switzerland was a short ride for an eager blond haired boy
With a silver smile and loaded with jewelery to enjoy
Maybe one day they'll come for me they'll take me from my bed
A soldier of fortune that's what my passport read
In the golden age of steam",The Golden Age of Steam,1999
Jerry Peterson,"There's a quiet time
When everyone goes home
And I'm left standing here
On the stage alone

When shadows paint the scene
Where spotlights used to fall
And now it's like a dream
Did it happen after all?

Then I see you there
In silent silhouette
The glow of your cigarette
Is like a shooting star

Lady of my heart
Tell me who you are
You've waited in the dark
And I need you will be with me tonight

Lady, please reveal
If what you are is real
Can I touch? Can I feel?
Just an image of you

I've listened to the cheers
I guess I've heard my share
But I was never sure
Was it you out there?

Now I understand
You've always been the one
Who stood out from the crowd
You're my inspiration

So take me by the hand
Before the moment's gone
I'll dance you into the dawn
And dream you into my life

Lady of my heart
Tell me who you are
You've waited in the dark
And I need you will be with me tonight

Lady, please reveal
If what you are is real
Yeah, can I touch? Can I feel?
Are you just a fantasy?

You're the lady of my heart
I know you are",Lady of My Heart,1984
Jerry Portnoy,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,2002
Jerry Portnoy,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2002

Jeah you know my sweet little baby, she ran of with the

Garbage man
Jeah you know I need this good looking woman",Garbage Man,2012
Jerry Raines,"You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knockin' on my door
 
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I begged you not to go, but you said goodbye
And now you tell me all your lies
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
 
You better get back to your use to be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me
 
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I told you way back in Fifty Two 
That I would never go with you
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been

Jerry Ray,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him

Couldn't go to sleep last night walked the floor until the daylight
Thinkin' how it used to be when you were here with me
And honey I'll live with your memory till I'm almost crazy almost crazy

Cause everytime I think of you my heart wants to break in two
And I'm no notning nothing but the blues till I'm almost crazy hmm
I thought I didn't need your love to share hmm
I had to lose you to find out how much I care now I'm almost crazy almost crazy

She is my baby and she lives next door 
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend 
I know she'll go with me until the end 
Everybody asks me how I know

Sittin' on his mama's knee
Well he picked up a feather and a piece of steel
And said that's gonna be the death of me

Name of Polly Ann

Jerry Reed,"Every night I go down to this same little joint
Fill up my glass till I reach the point past remembering
Where the music is loud the conversation is free
A dance or two with someone to keep me from remembering

The fool I've been the hurt I've caused the good woman that I loved and lost
For she's constantly with me in memory
I go home but I couldn't sleep and after hours I'd be walkin' the streets remembering
A good woman's love is hard to find and my woman's love was just that kind

And I'm the reason that she's gone today
I miss her so and the price that I pay is remembering
I take her to sleep in my dreams every night
Then start all over in the morning light remembering

The way it was when she loved me then like a fool how I carelessly
Broke her heart then watched my world fall apart
I'd give this world for yesterday just to have her love me the way I remember
Just to have her love me the way I remember",Remembering,1968
Jerry Reed,"If you put your mind to it and you try just a little bit
Well I know you could be the biggest fool of the world
You had yourself quite a woman the kind you don't find everyday
And just like a fool son you love her get away
You wouldn't know good thing if it came around
You wouldn't know a good thing if it knocked you down hmm

I hate to say that you're a fool but there's gonna come a time when you'll
Curse the day you let her love slip through your hands

Down in 'ol Alabama.
I brought along a donkey;
And a slice of salama!

In a dirty lawn chair,
And asked her nicely
To watch Yogi Bear.

Down in 'ol Tennesee.

And a little monkey.

On a rusty old chair;
And asked her while crying;
To please sniff my hair!!!

That day when your memory don't occupy my mind
That mornin' when I wake up with no regrets to find
Oh how many tomorrows will that be how many tomorrows till I'm free
I wonder how long until these heartaches end
Till yesterday's forgotten till the hurtin' wears in
And how much time your mem'ry is there left for me to spin
Oh how many tomorrows will that be how many tomorrows till I'm free
Oh they say that time can break the chains that bind your heart to yesterday
But deep inside of me is the love for you that time will never take away
It's there to stay
So a million tomorrows won't ease all the pain
And every day without you will be more the same
Achin' just to hold you inside these arms again

Sometimes;
Not all the time;
I get the sometime feelin' dumb.



",Sometimes Feelin',1970
Jerry Reed,"Well every love has got two sides and a love just cannot live
If one side always takes and never gives
So put yourself here in my place and just think how it would be
If I'd always hurt you like you hurt me
Turn it around in your mind turn it around see what you find
Look at our love from my point of view and see all the hurt I'm a going through
Just turn it around in your mind turn it around in your mind

Well you know I'll always forgive so you don't care if you're not true
Cause you know I'll swallow all my pride for you
But if you care for me at all then just picture if you can
How one side of our love looks from where I stand
Just turn it around in your mind turn it around see what you find
Look at love from my point of view and see all the hurt I'm going through
Just turn it around
Yes turn it around",Turn It Around in Your Mind,1970
Jerry Reed,"I've traveled o'er this country wide seeking fortune fair
Up and down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West back along the line
I'm going now to the place that's best that old hometown of mine

Eight more miles and Louisville will come into my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart

There's bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a traveling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville",Eight More Miles to Louisville,1971
Jerry Reed,"The preacher went out a huntin', it was on one Sunday morn'
It was against his religion, but he took a shotgun along
He got himself a mess o' mighty fine quail and one old scraggly hare
And on the way home he crossed the path of a great big grizzly bear
Well the bear got down lookin' ready to charge
The preacher never seen nothin' quite that large
They looked each other right smack in the eye
Didn't take that preacher long to say bye

The preacher, he run till he spotted a tree
He said, ""Up in that tree's where I oughta be""
By the time that bear made a grab for him
The preacher was a sittin' on top a that limb
Scared to death, he turned about
He looked to the sky and began to shout

""Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace
So the good books do declare
Hey lord, if you can't help me,
For goodness sake don't help that bear""

Yea, look out preacher!

Well, about that time the limb broke off
And the preacher came tumblin' down
Had a straight razor out of his pocket 
By the time he lit on the ground
He landed on his feet right in front a that bear
And Lord, what an awful fight 
The preacher and the bear and the razor and the hair
Flyin' from left to right

Well first they was up and then they was down
The preacher and the bear runnin' round an' round
The bear he roared, and the the preacher he groaned
He was havin' a tough time holdin' his own!
He said, ""Lord if I get out a here alive
To the good book I'll abide
No more huntin' on the Sabbath day
Come Sunday I'm headin' to the church to pray""

Up to the heavens the preacher glanced 
He said, ""Lord won't you give me just one more chance""
So the preacher got away, he looked around
Seen a tree where he'd be safe and sound
Jumped on a limb, turned about
Looked to the sky and began to shout

""Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace 
So the good books do declare
Hey lord, if you can't help me,
For goodness sake don't help that bear""",The Preacher and the Bear,1971
Jerry Reed,"Huh, yeah
Here we come

Well I remember when I was just children
A time when people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
And all their singin’ and their big prayer meetin’s
When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbor's hand

Oh, You talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Oh, if you ever needed help, a friend was there
Some good neighbor, helped lift your burdens
Oh and the simple joys of life your friends would share

But the times are harder and the people are changin’
Today most folks couldn’t tell you, who their next door neighbors are
All the guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain’t this ol’ world takin’ hate and fear just a little too far

Let's talk about the good times, let's talk about the good times
I wish, I could just go back to the days I’m speakin' of
When a friend would meet you and a smile would greet you
What this ol’ world needs now is old fashioned love

Play the guitar
Well alright

Well, my old granddaddy, God rest his soul now
Well we had a big long talk together the day he died
He said, ""Son this world is so full of hate and venom
An’ I can’t wait to leave this ol’ place and rest on the other side""

""Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
When I’m gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol’ days
We’ll have a big hand shakin’, sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away""

Talk about the good times, yeah

It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants

All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no!

Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
The birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it

Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
I'll be thinking of you

Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you

Some men search for silver some for gold

So that's when I told him 'We can't use you today'
So I handed the boy a dollar and sent him on his way
Well the boss got back and we both had a laugh 
When I told him 'bout the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And pretty soon I had the story circling around 
About this Mississippi nut that we had in our town.
I said, 'watch him everybody, the boy's squirrelly!
He walks around calling himself the Tupelo Mississippi Flash.'

I just happened to have my car radio on.
When I heard the jockey raving about a brand new smash
By a kid called the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
I almost wrecked my automobile
I went through a red light
I hit the traffic cop....Why??

'Cause I can see the love light shine

Tomorrow is a brand new song
And I might be a-movin' it on

So baby, let's just sing our song while we're together
Let's not look no further than today
Love me the night, just hold on tight and be my woman
And don't let a puff of real feelin' slip away

Who can settle down and walk on the line
And tomorrow I might be gone
So baby, let's sing our song, yeah

Through the swamps and the everglades.
There's a big ol' hole in Tiger Mountain.
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave.

I had me a girl in Waycross, Georgia,
But she had unfaithful ways.
She made me feel I wasn't wanted,
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave.

I couldn't stand the way she did me.
Couldn't take her low down ways.
Before I'll stay with a cheatin' woman,
I'll go and live with the bears in Miller's Cave.

Caught her out, Sunday morning,
With some guy they call big Dave.
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia,
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave.

I said: ""You'll pay both you and Davey,
""I'm gonna see you in your grave.""

I took their cheating, scheming bones to Miller's Cave.

The county's gonna haul my belongings away cause I'm busted. 

I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted 
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but I'm busted

Now my daddy was hard shelled Alabama preacher
My momma was a dedicated Sunday school teacher
My brother went to college and got a PHD
Daddy said the only dud in the family was me

He said â??Boy you ain't never going to amount to a thing
You set around with that silly looking guitar and sing
You hang around them juke joints all the time
Making music like some wild man done lost his mind

Sock it to me
Well what's that supposed to mean
Boy you just a wild manâ??

Well then one day daddy told me â??Boy I've had enough
Now you just pack up that guitar you just pack up your stuffâ??
So I left home and organized myself a band
Called myself the Alabama wild man

Well I worked all them joints from the east to the west
Never making no money and a-starving to death
A-living on coffee and cold sardines
Soda crackers and pork n beans

Said I'm the Alabama wild man and I'm here to stay
Took my guitar and showed â??em what I'm talking about
So we made a little record and we put it out

With me going

Ha ha hook it boy
Play that guitar

I was a showing my home town and the place was packed

Was my daddy grinning up at me batting at me

Jerry Reed,"I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's, where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes, I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ah, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!

I'll sing a song called the crude oil blues
We're low on heat 'n' all
We're low on gas
And I'm so cold I'm about to freeze myself
We got the crude oil blues
Cause the winter time sure gets cold to the bottom of my shoes
Well my hands are shakin' and my knees are weak
But it ain't because of love
It's from lack of heat
I'm gonna tell you a story about this drunk I know
He kept his basement full of homemade brew
But the winter got so bad it screwed up the boy's thinkin'
He got so cold he had to burn all his drinkin'
He's got the crude oil blues
He said the wintertime can sure get cold to the bottom of your shoes
He said, burnin' this booze just destroys my soul
But there's one thing about it honey
When you're cold, you're cold
I've got the crude oil blues
Well, when we made this record there was a little bit of doubt
Whether or not the ting was ever gonna come out
I said, ""Hey chief, you reckon this record will be released?""
He said, ""Son, we ain't got enough oil to keep the pressed greased""
We got the crude oil blues
And son, if we can't make records then we don't need you
I said, ""What am I gonna do if I can't sing and pick?""
He said, ""Well just keep yourself warm playin' all them hot licks""
We got the crude oil blues.

Well, I'm not a man appointed judge
To bear ill-will and hold a grudge
But I think it's time I said me a few choice words
All  about that demon automobile
A metal box with the polyglass wheel
The end result to a dream of Henry Ford
Well I've got a car that's mine alone
That me and the finance company own
A ready-made pile of manufactured grief
And if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain
I'm a-changin' a flat in a hurricane
I once spent three days lost on a cloverleaf
Well it ain't just the smoke and the traffic jam
That makes me the bitter fool I am
But this four-wheel buggy is 
A-dollaring me to death
For gas and oils and fluids and grease
And wires and tires and anti freeze
And them accessories

Well you can get a stereo tape and a color TV
Get a back-seat bar and reclining seats
And just pay once a month, like you do your rent
Well I figured it up and over a period of time
This four thousand dollar car of mine
Costs fourteen thousand dollars 
And ninety-nine cents, well now

Lord Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well Lord Mr. Ford what have you done

Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another
And I bet that half a car is a 
Trick to buy, don't you
But the thing that amazes me, I guess
Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of automobile he can afford to buy
Well now, red light, green light, traffic cop
Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card honey, we're out of gas
Well now, all the cars placed end to end
Would reach to the moon and back again
And there'd probably be some
Fool pull out to pass
Well now, how I yearn for the good old days
Without that carbon monoxide haze
A-hanging over the roar of the interstate
Well if the Lord that made the moon and stars
Would have meant for me and you to have cars
He'd have seen that we was all born
With a parking space

In my smoking, choking automobile","Lord, Mr. Ford",1978

Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator

That's all he got left 'cause an alligator bit it

Jerry Reed,"Me and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he'd play his guitar I'd lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine
Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on our bellies through the German lines
Audie I won't leave you here I'll pull you through cause buddy you're a pal of mine
Me and Phil Rizzuto didn't we move round like lightnin' on the double play
I'd look over in the stands and Marilyn should see me and she'd smile and wave
Hell no Coach Lombardi this old broken back ain't nothin' if the game was saved
And fellers if I don't pull through just put a little golden football on my grave
John Wayne he once said to me them Japs will take the Island
And we've got to save the old Red White and Blue
Someone's got to swim out to the submarine and warn 'em
And Bare you know I hate like hell to ask you to
Me and Tony Zarro we used to spar together up in Stillman's Gym
Knowin' someday it would be the Garden and the championship for me or him
And Coop if no one in this town is man enough to back you when Frank Miller comes
Then come High Noon I'll walk with you I may be young but I know how to use a gun
Judy Grable don't you cry you know you can be a star
And with my drinkin' I'd just hold you back
Go on and sign the contracts hon and I'll read about you
In some old newspaper blowin' cross some lonesome hobo camp
Me and Jimmie Rodgers we still ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he plays his guitar I lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine

And the newspaper print is becomin' so small
And folks talk so soft you can barely hear at all it's time just time

And the girls ain't half as pretty as I remember her
And today on the bus a grown man called me sir it's time just time

And my eye finds the girl in the plain simple dress
And I cling a bit longer to each warm caress that's time just time

There's something I'd like to say to you

You're from the place where I long to be, 
Your smiling face seems to say to me, 
You're from my own land,

Gee! but I've yearned, 
Longed to return 
To all the good old pals I left behind.

On a plantation near Birmingham, 
And one thing's certain, 
I'm surely flirtin' 
With those southbound trains:

Are you from Dixie? 
I said from Dixie! 
Where the fields of cotton beckon to me. 
I'm glad to see you,

Jerry Reed,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen,2000

Sewed my new blue jeans.

Is when he's all drunk.

Jerry Reed,"Hello, there, stranger! how do you do? 
There's something I'd like to say to you 
Don't be surprised 
You're recognized! 
I'm no detective but I've just surmised. 
You're from the place where I long to be, 
Your smiling face seems to say to me, 
You're from my own land, 
My sunny homeland, 
Tell me can it be?

It was a way back in eighty nine, 
I crossed the old Mason Dixon line 
Gee! but I've yearned, 
Longed to return 
To all the good old pals I left behind. 
My home is way down in Alabam' 
On a plantation near Birmingham, 
And one thing's certain, 
I'm surely flirtin' 
With those southbound trains:

Are you from Dixie? 
I said from Dixie! 
Where the fields of cotton beckon to me. 
I'm glad to see you, 
Tell me how be you 
And the friends I'm longing to see. 
If you're from Alabama, Tennessee or Caroline 
Any place below the Mason Dixon line
Then you're from Dixie, 
Hurrary for Dixie!

That I ain't being what I'm supposed to be
Well I don't know it could be true
I know I wasn't always there for you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me can't you see
I would never want to do what it
Seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I 
Wouldn't play

Don't let this be the reason you would
Walk away
The things you think I should do
I've never understood that part of you
You know I've tried to be a friend
But you feel underminded and hurt again

Now don't let it convince you
Please don't take it to heart
Compromise and realize
You can never really run everything
You start
You can't deal me the aces and think I
Wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would
Walk away

With this ticket for this outbound plane
'Cause I've been here before
But somehow it doesn't feel the same

We may never figure out just where our love went wrong

[Chorus]
I don't want to be standin' here
And I don't want to be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love
But you'll fall head and heel again

[Chorus]

Two lonely hearts in this aiport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

Is just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared
Back in the lost and found
These broken wings are gonna leave me here
To stand my ground

Jerry Reed,"Let me tell you bout a girl I know she's my baby and she lives next door
Every morning when the sun comes up she puts my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know yes I know hallelujah I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I need a friend I know she'll stick with me until the end
Everybody asks me how you know I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know yes I know hallelujah I just love her so
And when I call her on the telephone say her honey Jerry's all alone
By the time I count from one to four I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down when there ain't nobody else around
She looks at me and she holds me tight and tells me Jerry everything's all right

I told you she'd hurt you and leave more regret
And more heartache than you could ever forget
So sit there and cry boy the way that I did one time
And wish you could die boy to get that woman off of your mind
Go on and fall all to pieces boy the way that she made me do
I know what you're goin' through and I feel for you

When you took her from me you've thought you'd found
The woman to fill your whole world around
I'd tried to tell you but you wouldn't see
She'd leave you for someone the way she did me
Now sit there and cry boy

Would you love me once again
Cause I'll do anything to prove that I love you still
And that I'm sorry for the fool I've been
Haven't slept in a month of Sundays and I know one day I'm a gonna lose my sanity
Can't stop dreamin' about you and life without you just don't mean a thing to me
So if I promise to be a good boy and never hurt you anymore
Could things be like they were before
If I promise to be a good boy and be the way you want me to
Could I still have a chance with you

Cause I don't know what made me fool enough to think
That I could live without your love
I must have cried a million tears since our goodbye
Yes and misery fits me like a glove
So if I promise to be a good boy...



",If I Promise,2012
Jerry Reed,"Everybody tells me you're a woman with the past
Quick to make a promise but your love will never last
They tell me that I'm foolish to think that your love could be fair
But they don't know that I'm too much in love to even care
I'll be satisfied lovin' and losin' you honey if it comes to that
If it comes right down to hurtin' and you'll break this heart of mine
At least I've known the happiness of havin' your love for a time
If it happens that I lose you then I'll have the memory of how you loved me
I'll be yours until it happens and I'm gonna love you all the way
I don't care what comes tomorrow as long as you're all mine today
I'll be satisfied lovin' and losin' you honey if it comes to that

I'll forget someday cause honey real love it don't work that way

It looks mighty good this smile I wear actin' like I just don't care
If anybody mentions yesterday I'll just try to laugh it away
But honey it don't work...
I can walk around puttin' on there tellin' everybody that I don't care

But it's hard to hide the pain inside when a lonely heart is missin' you

And find you're long gone long gone

You just wandered into town
You took her and you started messin' around with my baby
You stole her heart cause she ain't used to your kind
With your fancy clothes and uptown style

It didn't take but a little while to get your way
'Cause your pretty little lies she couldn't see behind
And so it's long gone...

Yo en prision pero mi mente en el callejon
Pensando en mi corrilo why en su enterno bacilon
Me encuentro solo why triste why sufre mi corazon

Una colilla de cigarro mas, un cenicero que va a rebentar
La misma historia triste why sin final
El mismo cuento de nunca acabar
Why la carcajada de otra madrugada
OoOooooh

Se anulan cuatro paredes, rutina puerta cerrada
Why un carnaval de barrotes bailando sobre mi cama
Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar
Mi libertad

Ya no puedo con la condena que lucho dia a dia
Mi juventud se cubre en un celda fria
Mi alma penitencia, mi vida en agonia
Why es muy poca la esperanza de salir todavia

Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Una lagrima que moje el papel de mi triste carta
Pa' contarle a mi familia lo mucho que me hacen falta
A pesar de todo sigo con mi frente alta
Soy un simple ser-humano que en la sociedad descarta

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar
Why a mis amigos buenos visitar

Del cielo caen estrellas sin oir deseos
Deshojar una rosa es cosa ya de tontos
A nadie le interesan ya los sentimientos

Como los unicornios,
Van desapareciendo
Amar es hoy tan facil,
Solo es cosa de un beso
Un amor como el nuestro,
No debe morir jamas

Amores como el nuestro cada vez hay menos
En los muros casi nadie pinta corazones
Ya nadie se promete mas alla del tiempo
De sabanas mojadas hablan las canciones

Como Romeo y Julieta,
Lo nuestro es algo eterno
Estar enamorado,
Es darse por completo
Un amor como el nuestro,
No debe morir jamas

Como los unicornios,
Van desapareciendo
Amar y ser amado,
Es darse por completo
Un amor como el nuestro,
No debe morir jamas

SE ENCUENTRAN HOY YA MENOS

Merece la eternidad

Quien podría pedir mas

Es un buen negociador
Why un encantador play-boy
Predilecto de la lógica social
Cuatro yates, tres Van Gogh

why en el parking: dos Rolls Royce
Why en su corazón un hueco
Que no acaba de cerrar

why en sus ojos que enloquecen a las damas
Why que ahora siempre oculta tras la gafas
La nostalgia colorea sus pupilas
Why le pinta una acuarela
De momentos junto a ella

Why aunque todo ya lo tengo
Soy un pobre limosnero
Porque no tengo tu amor

Ay, amor, tu te has llevado mi razón
Why aunque nadie lo comprenda
Ahora nada me interesa
Porque no tengo tu amor

Why los que lo conocieron
Ya no saben que pensar
Enclaustrado allá arriba en su morada
Puedes verlo siempre frente a la ventana

Why la espera, por si vuelve

why aunque todo ya lo tengo soy
Un pobre limosnero pero de amor
La nostalgia todo el tiempo
Me acompaña pues mi corazon
Todavía te extraña

why como te extraño amor
Why aunque nadie lo comprenda ahora nada
Me interesa mas que tu amor
En la carcel de cristal sobre
El banco nacional muere
El principe de la ciudad
",El Principe de la Ciudad,1992
Jerry Rivera,"A ti mi nena, que con solo mirarte
Me basta para ser mis sueños
Quiero que sepas, que mi anhelo mayor
Es poder ser un dia tu dueño

Sabes mi nena, que me paso rondando
Tu casa a esperar que tu salgas?
Ver tu sonrisa, contestando a la mía
Why al fin encontrar tu mirada

Oye nena yo quiero que tu entiendas
Que tu eres la alegría que transforma mis penas
A tu lado todo será distinto
Quiero que estés conmigo hasta el fin de mis años

Sabes mi nena que los días
Los paso pensando en volver a verte?
Solo un minuto, que tu me
Dediques no importa será suficiente

Por ti mi nena yo sería capaz
De robarme la flor mas hermosa
Si la aceptaras, como muestra
De todo este amor que a mi pecho aprisiona

Oye nena mi corazón no aguanta
La espera me atormente mis brazos te reclaman
A tu lado todo será distinto quiero
Que estés conmigo hasta el fin de mis años
",A Ti Mi Nena,1992
Jerry Rivera,"Esa niña que tiembla en mis brazos
Y que finge tener veinte años
Esa niña que pide ternura
Ansiedad, libertad y locura

Esa niña que viene pegando
Bofetadas de vida y encantando
Esa niña que arrasa con todo
No sabe vivir poco a poco

Eres tu, o, tu, o, tu, o, tu
Quien quiera que seas tu, o, tu, o, tu, o, tu
Si tu lo deseas

Esa niña que tiembla en mis brazos
Y que finge tener viente años
Esa niña que pide canciones
Discoteca, guitarra y motores

Esa niña que guarda muñecos
Y que teme al amor y al colegio
Esa niña que me ha vuelto loco
Que me tiene absorbido del todo

Eres tu o tu o tu o tu
Quien quiera que seas tu o tu o tu o tu
Si tu lo deseas, deseas, deseas

Te quiero asi pequeña y agresiva con la vida
Loca perdida perdida perdida ahh
Te quiero asi pequeña y agresiva con la vida
Loca perdida perdida perdida ahh

Esa niña que tiembla en mis brazos
Y que finge tener viente años
La que me roba la calma la que
Me duerme siempre en sus brazos
Esa niña que pide locura esa niña que pide ternura

No fijes tener viente años eres
Solo una niña no quiero hacerte daño
Pero que niña mas preciosa
Ella es todavia un capullo de rosas

Es mi niña bonita cada dia mas preciosa
Te quiero asi pequeña y agresiva
Metienes locamente enamorado

Mira mis ojos brillan así por ti, 
Te deseo a morir 
Mira la gente mira la gran ciudad

Sonriendo dirán, que par de locos 

Darte un beso así, es ir al paraíso 
Es casi un hechizo 
Darte un beso así, me llena de calma 
Me llega gasta el alma 

Mira mis labios acércate un poco más 
De manera casual 
Muerde un suspiro, aprovecha mi descuido 
Ven, bésame sin dudar, sin hablar 
Dame más calor, lléname de tu amor 
Te necesito

Y tu disco suena suavemente
Eres tan distinta cuando vas saltando entre la gente

Sin saber por que te vas
No, no, no, no me puedes dejar asi

En las horas amargas de mi soledad
Quisiera estar junto a ti

Mira que puedo morir
Sabes que te necessito
Para poder vivir feliz
No, no me pudes dejar asi
Que no que no que no

No, quedate un poquito mas
No, no me puedes dejar asi
Quedate un poco mas aqui
No, si tu sonrisa sin tu mirda
Sin tus caricias yo soy nada

No, no
No me puedes dejar asi
Tan, tan desesperado
Enamorado, ilusionado
No se porque te perdi

No, no me puedes dejar asi
Con este amor que me quema
No, y me confunde los sentidos
Que hasta de mi quisiera oir

Soy arena del desierto
Voy, volando con el viento
Soy, quien va a vestir tu cuerpo
Hoy, con mi piel y mi aliento
Voy, cercando tu cintura
En las tardes tan obscuras
Que, solíamos amarnos

Solamente con miradas
Ven, ven, que quiero amarte
Ven, ven, que quiero hablarte
Ven, ven, ve lo que hoy siento
Cosas que oculté por miedo

que el amor en la distancia

Yo soy de los que entiendo
que no puede dividirse
la promesa que se escribe
con un beso
que lo nuestro será eterno
mientras creas como yo
en este amor

No hay razón para buscar
refugio en otros besos
sólo tienes que pensar
lo mucho niña que yo te quiero

Un amor verdadero
en la distancia sobrevive con un beso
un amor verdadero
es para siempre si se quiere de verdad
como yo te quiero

Yo sé que estás sufriendo
que te duele todo esto
que las noches para ti
son un infierno
que no entiendes
como puedo estar lejos
y a la vez sentirme así

refugio en otros besos
sólo tienes que pensar
lo mucho niña que yo te quiero

en la distancia sobrevive con un beso

Un amor verdadero
Ese es el que siento por ti, baby así te quiero

Todo lo puede, lo cree y lo soporta
Un amor verdadero
Si muere la esperanza y termina la fe, nuestro amor no acaba

Baby, amor eterno
Con sentimiento, para ti

Un amor verdadero
Ay que no tenga final, y que lo bendiga el cielo
Un amor verdadero
Que dure para siempre, porque este es amor del bueno
Un amor verdadero
Para hablarle cositas bonitas de este amor eterno

La magia que tiene su manera de enamorar
Tan bella, me estimula su calor
Su forma de caminar sensual hacia mi

Como me mata tu mirada, suave
Es el perfume de tu piel, suave
Son tus caricias como siempre soñe
Son tus caricias como siempre soñe, suave

Como la brisa del verano, suave
Como transportas al placer, suave

Convirtiendose en eco de mi soledad

Se agiganta en mi alma apretandome el pecho
No lo puedo evitar, no me puedo escapar
Are you recuerdo me acecha en cada lugar

Cuando creo que ya te olivde
Tu recuerdo me vuelva a buscar
Sigo siendo ese pez en tu red
Que aunque quiera no puede escapar

Del silencio aumentando mis ansias
Quebrando mi aliento why se niega

me has desgarrado el alma
es que sin ti yo me pierdo, me asfixio, me ahogo
se me esfuma la esperanza
de que yo pueda sin ti sobrevivir
de que yo pueda sin ti sobrevivir...

Si me devolvieras tan solo un momento
de lo que fue nuestra felicidad
olvidaria todo why detentria el tiempo
para que tu no te vayas jamas,
aunque con los dias las heridas sanaran
este a sido amor una herida mortal...

CORO

De todos modos que te vaya bien...
de todos modos te recordare
why le pido a Dios mantener la fe aunque no te vuelva a ver...

Jerry Rivera,"Otra vez con el corazón con los ojos tristes
Yo solo quería sentir ser feliz
Y hoy me doy cuenta que ya te has marchado
No te podre detener pero conmigo tú vas a volver

Yo se que entre nosotros jamás nos falto el amor
Pero todo pudo ir mejor, no quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quiero ser algo más y me lanzo por ti
No te va a ser fácil deshacerte de mí

Ahora es tiempo de poder olvidar y volver a empezar
Te extraño, es cierto, es verdad que noche vivir sin ti
Por eso hoy vengo
Pues yo se que los dos podemos volver a amar

Yo creí fácil en el amor que sabía bien, no sabía de sufrir
Y no es así, llego la hora de cambiar
Nunca es tarde no, menos mal que pude
Ver que de mis errores pude aprender

Yo se que entre nosotros jamás nos falto el amor
Pero todo pudo ir mejor, no quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quiero ser algo más y me lanzo por ti
No te va a ser fácil deshacerte de mí

Ahora es tiempo de poder olvidar y volver a empezar
Te extraño, es cierto, es verdad que noche vivir sin ti
Por eso hoy vengo
Pues yo se que los dos podemos volver a amar

Y aunque no siento más
Si que ambos lo intentamos
Lo que hicimos
Y aquí estamos
Dejándonos en un adiós la vida, ieh

Yo en prision pero mi mente en el callejon
Pensando en mi corrilo why en su enterno bacilon
Me encuentro solo why triste why sufre mi corazon
(Ay dios mio)

Una colilla de cigarro mas, un cenicero que va a rebentar
La misma historia triste why sin final
El mismo cuento de nunca acabar
Why la carcajada de otra madrugada
OoOooooh

Se anulan cuatro paredes, rutina puerta cerrada
Why un carnaval de barrotes bailando sobre mi cama
Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar
Mi libertad

Ya no puedo con la condena que lucho dia a dia
Mi juventud se cubre en un celda fria
Mi alma penitencia, mi vida en agonia
Why es muy poca la esperanza de salir todavia

Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Una lagrima que moje el papel de mi triste carta
Pa' contarle a mi familia lo mucho que me hacen falta
A pesar de todo sigo con mi frente alta
Soy un simple ser-humano que en la sociedad descarta

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar
Why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar
Mi libertad

Oyeme Jerry
(Aha)
Yo te digo la verdad, no es lo que cuesta
(Y que?)
Sino cuanto vale La libertad

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar
Why a mis amigos buenos visitar

El mismo cuento que de nunca acabar)

La vergüenza de haber sido
Y el dolor de ya no ser

Bajo el ala del sombrero
Cuántas veces embozada
Una lagrima asomada
Yo no pude contener

Si crucé por los caminos
Como un paria que el destino
Se empeñó en deshacer

Si fui flojo, si fui ciego
Sólo quiero que comprendan
El valor que representa
El coraje de querer

Era para mí la vida entera
Como un sol de primavera
Mi esperanza y mi pasión

Sabía que en el mundo no cabía
Toda la humilde alegría de mi pobre corazón
Ahora, cuesta abajo en mi rodada
Las ilusiones pasadas

Ya no las puedo arrancar
Sueño con el pasado que añoro
El tiempo viejo que lloro
Y que nunca volverá

Por seguir tras de sus huellas
Yo bebí incansablemente
En mi copa de dolor

Pero nadie comprendía
Que si todo yo lo daba
En cada vuelta dejaba
Pedazos de corazón

Ahora, triste en la pendiente
Solitario y ya vencido
Yo me quiero confesar
Si aquella boca mentía

El amor que me ofrecía
Por aquellos ojos brujos
Yo habría dado siempre más

Hará nido en tu pelo

Donde me cobijo

Tuyo es su querer

Que veinte años no es nada
Que febril la mirada
Errante en las sombras
Te busca y te nombra

Vivir con el alma aferrada
A un dulce recuerdo
Que lloro otra vez

Tengo miedo del encuentro
Con el pasado que vuelve
A enfrentarse con mi vida

Tengo miedo de las noches
Que pobladas de recuerdos
Encadenen mi soñar

Pero el viajero que huye
Tarde o temprano
Detiene su andar

Y aunque el olvido
Que todo destruye
Haya matado mi vieja ilusión

Guardo escondida
Una esperanza humilde
Que es toda la fortuna
De mi corazón

An old man sat in his little cabin door
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
A jolly old tune that he played by ear.

It was raining hard but the fiddler didn't care
He sawed away at the popular air
Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
That didn't seem to bother the old man at all.

A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn't seem to fret.

So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
You'd better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn't mend it now it's a rainy day.

The traveler replied that's all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.

But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
Get along said he for you give me a pain

Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame

We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize

Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen

Y yo tan lejos de Maracaibo
Los muchachos
Deben estar echándose unos palitos
Como estará la viejita
Papa, como estarán por la casa
Y yo aquí recordando

En noche de navidad
y debiera estar feliz
Y ya ves que no es así
Porque no estoy en mi lar
No dejo de recordar
Mis viejos y mis hermano
Y me siento tan lejano
Que quisiera regresar

Y oigo una gaita zuliana
A lo lejos de la noche
Y se esparce en (así) un derroche
Que impregna mi corazón
Me encuentro otro maracucho
y armamos el parrandón

Where do they go when their
melodies die?

I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began, 

Before I knew where I was at, 
I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found,

I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man,

Why can't I let you know,

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

Nothing seemed the way it used to be

Was that lonely woman really me

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

Jerry Vale,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.

Laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?

Day by day.
They look so natural together,
Just like two newlyweds should be.
Is there a canopy in store for me?

Jerry Vale,"I forgive

He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea
He alone decides who writes a symphony
He lights every star that makes a darkness bright
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night

He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer
Saint or sinner call and always find Him there
Though it makes Him sad to see the way we live
He'll always say, I forgive

He can grant a wish or make a dream come true
He can paint the clouds and turn gray to blue
He alone is there to find a rainbow's end
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend

He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold
He knows every lie that you and I have told
Though it makes Him sad to see the way we live
He'll always say, I forgive

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O. Holy Night!,2003

The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!","O, Holy Night! [DVD]",2009
Jerry Van,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I've had some very good years.
I haven't missed a whole lot in those firecracker years,
And I don't want to miss a thing when the future appears.
I like to sit outside on a summer night with a drink in my hand.
And a little moonlit music on the stereo, and look at the stars.
Then I get an urge to travel to that fabulous sky,
If they can do it in the movies, why can't I?

And when the Satellite Tours begin,
Count me in, 

""Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.""

When I arrive at Venus, it will surely be spring,
And the girl I have waited for, will be waiting for me,
And she'll dance with me all the afternoon,
Comfort me when the darkness falls,
And she'll still be there in the morning when I need her the most.
Maybe when I get to Venus, I will never be lonely again.

What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month

Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick

Muthafuckas act hard

Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down

I'll tap your jaw

Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers

My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout

A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that?  Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it

Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
and all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her
cause she be working on my nerves
and yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
and I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all
With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath
And stay the fuck out my path",Speak Ya Clout,
Jeru the Damaja,"Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth
Nothing’s secret

As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless
Wisdom of the sages, ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end, it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like abel and cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the devil happy

I hate when the devil's happy, so I wear my hair hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like john gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chillin, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What, are we accomplishing? nothing
What's, the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another queen without a king
What will out children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the devil happy

Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range I hope you hear this
And try to change this, cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot, who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all, is the god we trust
The days blow by like dust
Even men of steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous
When, only we can save us
Mentally enslave us, for little or nothing kill our neighbors
Animalistic, caniballistic, behavior
Look to the sky for your savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers? you must discover
The power of self, know thyself, or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for
Ain't the devil happy",Ain't the Devil Happy,1994
Jeru the Damaja,"Dirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called, on the street
Could connive and cheat but rarely get beat
Ya see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro
Kickin the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo
Not stressin five-o, hot hand in cee-lo
Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough
Homicide central, East New York
Where the manic, depressive psycho murderers stalk
Walk, like a ninja, on the asphalt
Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk
And there's more hardtimes, than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime
So I'm steady schemin, won't work for a dime
Used to get, tax free loot, all the time
Type slick can't fess on 'Ru, because
I'm the original dirty rotten scoundrel

Before trains were graffiti proof I used to get loose
Dirty rotten since the days of the deuce
Dirty, because of the skin I'm in
The fact I have melanin automatically makes me a felon
Even though I'm righteous, rotten's what you're yellin
But I'm not chain-snatchin, or drug-sellin
According to your books you said I would be damned like Ham
Scoundrel opposite of the king that I am
But wanna get funny, we can get bummy
Take you to the East and back again money
Filthy putrified trick, step past your sister
Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be histo - ry
Mortal Kombat fatality, the original don't sing no R&B
Nasty MC deity
Chop off domes with the poems that come out of my pin-eal
Gland, as I expand, you know who I am

Father of all stylin, I be whylin on wax
We hack shit up like big ax and little ax
Don't need tokes to make you jump like bungee
Tracks real muddy, like Brooklyn's real grungy
When I come through I clog up your sewer
Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure
So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter
No matter what you do, you can't get through the
Crud that comes out of your system
You're another victim, of dirty rotten
Dirt up, in your grill, so what ya gonna do
But pay homage to",D. Original,1994
Jeru the Damaja,"I'm not talking about the queens
But [what?] the bitches
Not the sisters [what?] the bitches
Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches
The bitches, the bitches

Now a queen's a queen and a stunt is a stunt
You can tell who's who by the things they want

Most chicks want minks
Diamonds, a Benz
Spend up all your ends
Prob'bly fuck your friends

High-post attitudes, real rude with fat asses
Think that the pussy is made out of gold
Try to control you by slidin' up and down on the wood
They be givin' up sex for goods

Dealin' with bitches is the same old song
They only want you 'til someone richer comes along

Don't get me wrong, strong black women
I know who's who so due respect I'm givin'

While queens stand by you, and stick around
Bitches suck you dry and push you down
So it's my duty to address
This vampiress
Givin' the black man stress
Recognize what's real and not material
Or burn in hell, chasin' Polo and Guess, dumb bitches

I'm not talking about the queens
But [what?] the bitches
Not the sisters [what?] the bitches
Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches
The bitches, the bitches

My man had a chick an' thought she was finger-lickin'
I knew her style that's why I'm vegetarian
I told him she was out to get what she could get
He didn't believe me, so she bagged him up in the end
Made the pussy do tricks then she sucked his dick
He got caught up in the grip now he's payin' the rent

Black Widow: she even killed dead presidents
That he'd owe. Shouldn't have got one red cent
I body slam her But I'm not a misogynist
When I see a brother gettin' nabbed it makes me pissed

Cosmetic enchantress scandalous temptress
The way my man went out you'd think she was a pimpstress

Bitches come my way, I make 'em hop
Cause I'm hip to the game
I'm not a slave so I don't get pussy-whipped
Bear in mind you'll lose em' to end material riches
Fuckin' around with those bitches

I'm not talking about the queens
But [what?] the bitches
Not the sisters [what?] the bitches
Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches
The bitches, the bitches

Since I've been club-hoppin'
You've been ho-hoppin'
You've seen them pop up in every spot that I'm in

Any nigga with a record
Could get your butt naked

So your man got a Lexus
You live in the projects
Tryin' a flex but you ain't the smartest
Your ass ain't the fattest
Fuck around, play yourself and get dissed
I know your status, you can't touch my status
Deep down you want this
Dyin' a be famous but you can't attain this

Poppin' that coochie for Gucci
Bitches like you ain't shit to me
And don't talk about R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Cause I treat my black sisters like royalty

Now go in peace Don't make me get raw
And treat you like the harlot that you are
Filthy bitches",Da Bichez,1994
Jeru the Damaja,"It started on the sands of land of the mother
Word to mother, king like my father
My style survived slave ships, whips, and chains, hardships
Still through all this the praise roll off my lips
Bring your guns, chains and tone force your religion
On me cut my hair, the vibes still exist
To destroy the molesters of my heritage
But they conceal the drums of evil, my loyal lineage
King of kings, God of gods
Like my ancestors drums I beat the odds
More mics killed than slaves during the middle passages
Who rapes and ravages and calls us savage?
Jungle bunny, I'm not mo' funny, I'm mo' deadly
They know one day we'll learn how to use it
That's why they fear our jungle music

We went from pyramids to the ghetto
Still my sounds make devils tumble like the walls of Jerico
Chant my paower to devour all the snakes and rats
Extrasensory perception to avoid all traps
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord
In the sancuary of your caves white kids press record
As my mystic music spread from sea to galaxy
It's inevitable, you can't stop me
Try to carbon copy, but it always comes out sloppy
You can't outrap me, you can't outrock me
Like the dreads on my head, you try and lock me
Down underground, but I bounce to the jungle
Melodies, that flows like the breeze
Through the trees, like my forefathers, command the wind and seas
With my jungle music

Unga bunga binga
Sound warrior, I'll take your head more than a rap singer
Enlightener, with the mitre
Make the forces of my nature smite ya
Over the airwaves, powers are released
Holy music destroy the savage beast
I'll beat the devil like a Niyabini drummer
Beasts his drum, this beat will drum through the summer
Try to hold us back with all the strength you can muster
You'll hear a sound similar to the one Custer
Heard before he got ambushed, you'll get ambushed
For taking this back to Kush
For too long you've abused it
On the low used it, and called it jungle music",Jungle Music,1994
Jeru the Damaja,"I annihilate, as I articulate
Words of power, your rhymes are unconfounding so death's your fate
Ostentatious genius, of rappin
Is mentally clappin to take hip-hop back, that's what's happenin
Proficiency and ingenuity
Plus more styles, than a Shaolin mon-es-tary
In poetry my formula's deadly
Bring your hypest man in your army another casual-ty
Slow like demise I crept on those that slept
Droppin my rhyme science like I'm Imhotep
Application of mind over matter
Made fools scatter, rhymes fatter, minds splatter
Your girl bend over and over and over
MC's try to touch the Damaja but you just can't win
Excellent with the word play, you lay
Face down, when my, mind spray

Thunder on your Dome with no help from Mad Max
Lyrics like hype tattoos go over the dope tracks
We booby-traps, all our inventions
We know the intentions of MC kleptomaniacs
Rap brainiacs have cardiacs soon after the attack
When it comes to ryhmin I slam harder than Shaq
Accomplish the bio-feedback, more complex than an almanac
Keep you up like an afrodesiac
Idealist not an opportunist
Don't molest no shorty still in all, I'm dangerous
Mentally you can't talk to me, hear me, or see me
You're not equipped
From, street blocks to cell blocks my vo-cals rock
Do more work than a crackhead with a, toolbox
Jeru never touch-er, mic-ra-phone wrecker
If your honey's a Queen I'll sex her
More important, the mind strikes like the nine strikes
A priest by May
You reach for your uzay, when my mind spray

J-E, Rrrah-you it's a horror to you
Lyrical kung-fu so do your kung-fu if you know kung-fu
Dirty, down low profile
Shoot up jams without the aid of lead projectiles
Style's ridiculous, techniques infamous
Take more heads than Santa Claus at Christmas
Science misfits, meet the wrath of my wit
Immediately following, they go into a conniption fit
Reach into my bag of darkness and spark this like an arsonist
Blow up like a terrorist
I'm not a sexist don't have the power to be a racist
I'm a scientist, and an activist
Complex yeah simple like Mixelplics
Unlike the silly devil, I don't come with tricks/Trix
So out there to all you MC's return to the righteous way
Or meet death face to face when my, mind spray",My Mind Spray,1994
Jeru the Damaja,"Electromagnetic beam, I get charged
Rhymes I run right thru em like a big box of Trojan large
Mc's tried to hang but its a Brooklyn thang
Poison slang, poison fang
Poison pen let me begin
Tryin to rhyme up in my cipher is gambilin
Freestylin me g, I be buckwilin
You can't even challenge a nigga in my position
Technician, renditions more freaky than Rick James
Fly like airplanes thru all it remain the same
My cuts like Freddy Krueger
Dont need a German Luger
But shoot more shit than Sturm-Ruger
Dirty rottens comin thru punks cling to their guns
Dont start none, there won't be none
Cuz ah, fuck around and it'll be tragic

And I could rock a rhyme with just statik

Devastating, I gotcha heart pulsating
Kool-Aid, you need aid, ejaculating
Rhymes like semen, Mc's is scheming
Tryin to bag me baby black you must be beemin
Feenin, I dont know who gased ya head up
Im straight up, for less niggas have got wet up
Im on a mission, scrambling my enemies transmission
When he least expect it, run up in his h-q
Hi I.Q., every verse is e-q ued
Slither like a snake, still you can't elude
The neba, but not caneza
Its the toucha, no gun or God can protect ya
Neither the scripture, choke like a boa constrictor
This is my house and I'll evict ya
Big respect is automatic black

I'll snatch up your girlfriend, her friend and their friends
I got the game & fame she got the condoms
She's a victim, you shouldn't have that mouth dirty rotten
And for the longest we knew you were plottin'
On the down fall, who stands tall, lick the balls
Im not like that, so I smash out pussy walls
On the low, oh no, on the high
I get high, praise to the most high
Tried to battle me, step up & die
Like the arc of the covenant I electrify
Petrify, intelligence I glorify
So devils are horrified
Sprayin like pesticide, come commit suicide
Step into my realm and be fried
By the statik",Statik,1994
Jeru the Damaja,"You wanna front, what, jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake gangster MCs and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp defunkt
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rock smelling the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!",Come Clean,1995
Jeru the Damaja,"Out of the fog into the smog, he walks in
        he's ready for victory
        He walks again by night, ruthlessly
        meeting wit the unknown

It's the educated field nigga, trained in guerilla
Warfare plus equipped wit mental hardware
Manifesting organizational skills
'cause organizational skills kills more devils than bullets
Pull it, the psychological trigger and be a real nigga
Happy as a runaway slave in the jungle
The concrete jungle, here's your scars weary, here's your arms don't fear 'em
But you might die if you bail against the system
Another nigga caught up in the system
To amend my invisible chains and deviate from the system
No longer shall I be a victim
Victimized, circumsized by the lies of the system
It's equivalent to being nonexisent
I used to be a pawn in the game
Now I change my position, I'm making moves
Beware of the frustrated nigga
Know what I'm saying

Ride the pale horse, triumphantly
Put a saddle on his back, take him to hell and back
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can't take the jungle out the cat
Black cats, brown cats, all types of cats
Mental fusion, it's no illusion, or delusion
Of grandeur but the way we were
And will be and ever shall be
Eternally but you mask my present existence
In ignorance, mock my appearance
Yet yearn for my esscence, steal my lessons
So I reeducate, unlearn what
Was taught, hold down the fort
Each one teach one, now I got support
We don't need no water, let the muthafuka burn
Down to the ground
America, America, the beautiful thoughts
From a frustrated nigga
You know what I'm saying

Systematic, destruction of the original man
Drugs by nigga on nigga
Cocaine, morphine, nicotine
The evil of men run through my bloodstream
And the blood of kings runs through my bloodstream
This dignified bastard
Hazardous to the health of America
Black rebel in your area
Psychoanalyze this
Then send your forces 'cause now we mean business
You should now bear witness to a new brand of nigga
This nigga is smarter than the nigga of time's past
This nigga is the nigga of the future
This nigga will emancipate himself from the title of nigga
And restore his title as king
So beware, beware, beware, beware

Jeru the Damaja,"Here's the remedy, for all your cornball raps
Brooklyn's back on the map, I'm not bragging
Defeating all foes, bring your styles
I stomp out the last dragon
Grand groove, Grandmaster, like back in the days
Holding my own, on the street and the microphone
You can't rip it, I grip it, and flip it
Trip it down memory lane, back to the park jams
We used to spark jams, now niggas get jammed
Or should I say jelly?
My vocals rip through your Pelle Pelle
You can't see me so you can't hit me
You ace deuce tre, I four five six and trips
Drums numb your ears, rhymes swell up your lips
Chicks gravitate towards the crooked
If your props are gone, Brooklyn took it

Mindcrusher, spinecrusher, Brooklyn been banging
Making noise from the US to Russia
Couldn't set it, even if you wanted
So many bodies on my microphone, the shit's haunted
Doggonnit, your girl's on it
Record companies are on it, you can't have it, causing havoc
Building, destroying, deploying
My rhymes on beats strategically I melt any MC
I repre- aww fuck it, don't even need to say it
You know the time when I start to sautee it
So niggas be having mad maws and shit
Cause Brooklyn stole the show like a grand larcenist
But ease up off us, or you'll need officers
We're deadly, there's no cure
Boom bang em on down, treat competition like clowns
Crooklyn, Crooklyn, from town to town
Serve your girl butt naked
If she's gone, who took it?

This one is for Brooklyn, land of crooks, home of my game
Try to front and we retire, MC's set em all on fire
Scooping up the fly ladies round my microphone like a Mercedes
If I was a video game you couldn't play me
So keep it moving, don't play yourself
Your rhymes are sinna raffin, mine quite graffing
Switch up, change up, Brooklyn still gets biz
Plop plop, fizz fizz like Alka-Seltzer
Try to freak it, wind up in a homelsss shelter
Cause fuck what you heard, this is Crooklyn's casa
Try to see us, and it's an MC massacre
When we step, your state we shook it

Pugilistic linguistics check out the mystics we're fantistic
You mean fantastic

Vanacrobatics

Can't understand the mathematics are esoteric

Way back I stomped out Her-see you-les
But now I stomp out MC's
Can't chill, because the Sun don't freeze
Heavy metal, hard like titaniam

Influential, scientifical power

Devour at a crazy rate, I speed into your circuits

Stamina, in the brain is how I slay it
I enforce my boss and I always must obey it
Endorsing a central rhyme of remedies
Against any man at arms that can get with thee
Eternal, internal, alchemist, I spill
logic and science ever since
Throwing cerebral blows without my fist
Poisonous, Taoist
Don't mess with toys in this racket
Terrorists don't proceed to hi-jack it

It's too perverted, you heard it, so now you get murdered
Test the sound system, it throws off your equilibrium
Deep concentration can't fracture the meditation
Competition is flipped on at random
Deviant monks attack the mic is mental pandemonium
And then some, you go for your hand gun
Psychokinetic forces proceed to smash in your cerebellum
Phonetian with more stamina than a Christian
my mind, C3 H5 N3 O9 like Nitroglycerine
I bust as Afu Ra crush
Class with us and meet Cerebus

Ready, ridiculous rabbitry, as I commence
I whirlwind through cities
Breaking down substances, combining matter

Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like Blanka

The Black Prophet
One day I got struck by Knowledge of Self
It gave me super-scientifical powers
Now I, run through the ghetto
Battlin my, arch nemesis Mr. Ignorance
He's been tryin to take me out since the days of my youth
He feared this day would come
I'm hot on his trail, but sometimes he slips away
Because he has an army, they always give me trouble
Mainly - Hatred, Jealousy and Envy they attack me
They think they got me
But I use my super-science and I twist all three
I see sparks over that buildin - they're shootin at me
I dip, do a backflip
Then hit em in the heart with sharp steel bookmarks
Ignorance hates when I drop it
But no matter, what he do.. he can't stop the Prophet

Yo Prophet, yo Prophet, come here real quick
Yo I just saw Ignorance downtown, let me put you on

Word, he down there buggin
He got them illin out, they shootin and everything else..

Let's continue the saga, mad mad drama
I met this chick, she said she knew where Ignorance was at
I said, ""Where?""
She said, ""Downtown""
He had babies havin babies - and young niggaz sellin crack
I think the bitch is lyin, it's a set up
I can smell it, but Ignorance is runnin rampant
Aight baby show me the exact spot
Meet me at Hoyt and Schermerhorn at 3 on the dot
So I hops up on the A-Train, I'm bein followed
My seventh sense senses danger
I turn around, it's Anger
and he brought a mob along, it's the same old song
Despair and Animosity got broke with the swiftness
I don't know what they think this is
I feel a sharp pain in my neck
Now I can't see, I'm like Hiram
They hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum
I tried to hold on but before long I dropped
When I awoke I was locked in the barber's shop
Trapped in the barber's chair
Oh no, they're gonna try and cut my hair
But that can't stop the Prophet

Yo Prophet!
Ignorance is tired of you followin him around
We about to put an end to that RIGHT NOW
Anamosity (YEA!) Despair (YO WHASSUP?) Get him!!

A few minutes passed by, I hear a buzzin noise
It was that chick with some of Ignorance's boys
She said, ""Prophet, we got you beat;
by the way I'm Mr. Ignorance's wife, Deceit
But enough talk; now for your hair cut""
When the clippers touched my hair, they blew the fuck up
After the explosion there was no one left
Cause I know Dim Mak/poison hand/touch of death
My vision's still kinda blurry, but I see a clue
Ignorance is at the library
I hurry, with lightning speed like The Flash
He's at the big one, on Grand, Army Plaz'
When I get inside the doors shut and the lights go off
Damn, another trap
I hear a hissin sound, I smell a funny smell
I gasp, I can't breathe

Killing smooth and silently like the Rasta James Bond
Armed and dangerous, so grab your pistols

Jeru the Damaja,"Verse 1
-------

I heard some MC's want to bring it
But a female is one of their strongest men
When I step to you don't seek refuge
Make it happen, fuck the rappin'
Because I know I got that sewed
The first time I ever touched the microphone it glowed
Now I explode, eruptin' like a nigga that drunk too much
But not intoxicated...
As mental stress increase you'll need to be sedated
Sick and tired of the izm schism
This time's a warning, after this we take it to pugilism
Mash out the beedies, dreads spark up the corn
I flow muddy like the gutter after the rainstorm
My mission to seek, build or destroy
Like Deadwood Dick, I be the Black Cowboy
And this is the showdown...

Chorus
------

[Primo scratching]

""I got the wild style..."" / ""Black Cowboy""

Verse 2
-------

After this MC's will wish to do battle with me
For their sake I hope that they apply the proper strategy
In any case, worst comes to worst I'll be the best
Storms will come, this we know for sure, but can you stand the crash test?
There's no vest or no way you can get suited up
For what's about to happen, you might as well get zooted
I heard that ignorance is bliss, so I guess you're all blistered
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
And just in case the first time you missed it
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
Livin' on a diet of flesh and Mistic
I kicks the ballistics and keep it realistic
We shoot shit up like the Hatfields and McCoys
Perverted monks, the Black Cowboys
And this is the showdown...

Repeat chorus

Verse 3
-------

It's a cryin' shame what some niggas'll do for fame
When they think they know the game
But I switch up the rules of the game
Drops jewels in the game
The fluid is quite fatal, like water on the brain
I be the Sheriff and I got MC's on the chain gang
Continuous hard labour until the day that they hang
One outlaw tried to escape but I murdered his gang
Right back at ya bitch-ass just like a boomerang
Or a bolo, you couldn't knock me out with Apollo
The god is never chillin', hot like a volcano
Once I met up with this bandolero
Why'd he make me bust him in his head with his banjo?
I put MC's on the ceiling like Michelangelo
Did the Sixteenth [Sistine] Chapel
Known to kick and grapple, so you couldn't test the Real McCoy
The Black Cowboys
And this is the showdown...

Repeat chorus",Black Cowboys,1996
Jeru the Damaja,"I got a freaky freaky freak, give you a freak you turns em out
I put them hoes in a row and turn out Queens no doubt
Don't need a vest, but flow freely like bullets through shootouts
I be the real supernatural, so check it out
I was concieved in the center of an inferno
The ninth month I slipped out my mom's vaginal
Cavity, now I'm surrounded by creeps and freaks
Had to watch my back in the New York streets
Fly, like an aeroplane, more powerful than the engine of an A train
Won't stress my brain
You know the fame that has men sold and bought
In a single bound, I let the criminal court
Walk through the desert and won't perspire
Touch the microphone, the whole joint catches afire
Use the opportunity to call the devil a liar
And I won't stop flipping shit til I'm forced to retire
Because that's how I'm living

I can stroke all night and not bust a nut
Swim through a sea of razorblades and not get cut
When I do my thing I aim for the gut
And despise those nasty guys that hit shit in the butt
Blaze like spliffs even back in the days
When I bag shit up like trays, nowadays
I bag 'em up like dimes and not even the Devil
Can stop me cause it's matter under mind
I'm fucking up your mind like a hallucinogen
(Are you hot, Lord?) I heat it up like halogen
Burn MC's, their children, and their children's children
Reverse polarity and make your girl's hell heaven
More intelligent than MacGuyver
Quick to pull off on a stunt like an Indy car driver
Thoughts too intense, brainwaves cut like barbed wire
Since Run's a reverend, sucker MC's call me sire
Push for my mental forces to crush your fortress
Signals of stress, your whole squad's put to death
Bring your white Superman and I'll rip that fucking S off his chest
Cause that's just how I'm living

I dedicate my life to taking snake heads
I break on the beats like scissors break on my dreads
Instead of eating beasts and living savagely
I aspire to excel to the highest degree
Of living, now how you living, like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Me? I keep it tight and lock it down like a virgin's pops
>From crack rocks to suburbian spots I'm hot
Don't forget or have you forgot that I'm a surgeon, Ak-
Bar, once outran a jaguar
Slept in a lion's den and escaped without a scar
Close my eyes and comence the star travel
Fred Flintstone's out a job because I turn hard rocks to gravel
Babble, never, control the weather
Like a few jams back, whatever's, clever
Even the rudest of rude can't test because I'm protectes
With the Breastplate of Righteousness
And that's just how I'm living",How I'm Livin',1996
Jeru the Damaja,"Verse One:

Police all on my dick like I shot somebody
Cause of these big ass lips and I rock my locks knotty
Life is getting hectic Tupac got shot in the nuts
You saw cops was corrupt when Rodney King got fucked up
With friends like these who needs enemies
Constantly harassing, filling up my nuts like a Klansman
Snatching up a nigga for nuttin I heard bad guys wear black
So I guess I'm the motherfucking villain
Under pressure they got me under pressure
What's your name your address and phone number
Your occupation come down to the station
There's been a robbery they claim a nigga fit the description
It can't be, so I slides out on em
In ninety-five you gotta catch a nigga, if you want him
One to three, and five to ten
Bullies in blue suits Son with automatic weapons
I'm stressed, ready to blow up somethin
The beast keep frontin, invasion

Verse Two:

I was forced into a life of crime
Career criminal, now my career is crime
My mind is in a fucked up state
A brainwashed state, is the black man's fate, in the ground
or locked down upstate, when I was young I used to shoot for the stars
but got shot down by demons in patrol cars
Stars good cop, bad cop, stick up the crack spot
The ave won't get hot til one of their crew gets shot
Ask, Larry Davis, how much they took
Cops and crooks, but who's the crooks?
Take a nigga to jail, make bail, guilty or innocent
The system gets ten percent
Frontin like you're doin somethin
But you ain't sayin nothin, invasion

Verse Three:

Come up in my cipher best believe I'ma dip on that ass
Beast-boy I'm professional heart of the ghetto
raised, in the ways of thugs
Dodgin slugs, takin slugs, driving stolen automobiles
skills fantastical
Living life on the edge it's dramatic, mad drama
I'm a fanatic, adrenalin addict
Getaway car, stick shit or automatic
Where's my crew at, you got your crew scopin
for a nigga up and down the Ave, it makes me laugh
Eat my nuts, eat my dust
I won't spend the night locked up or in handcuffs
'cause in the conrete jungle, I got the right stuff
Smooth operator, pilot and navigator

From the same man, who brought you Da Bichez
(Da Bichez, Da Bichez, Da Bichez)
We were misunderstood, last time we brought you
Ba Bichez (Da Bichez Da Bichez)
Now we gonna clear it up and let you make up your own mind
like this...

Now a queen's a queen, and a whore is a whore
She felt if she made me wait I'd have more respect for her
Adore her, eventually spendin up my digits
She felt that love would make me buy her mad material shit
She likes to trick em, cause ain't nothin like a sleepin victim
East New York style stick em -- ha ha ha, stick em
Top rated game, but if it's game I played it
Underestimated, swore the king was checkmated
She claims she loves my mind, cause I'm so intelligent
But fuck my mental, she was scheming on my mint
Evil inten-tion, to de-plenish the fund
She tried to juice me with the pussy cept for, the mask and gun
I was a fool to fall in lust with this evil ge-nius
She had me by the nuts
She ain't got shit but man she loves it plush
Whippin I whip, and suckin up I canibus
Back in the days, I woulda scraped her for this caper
But I realize, it wasn't me it was the paper

Let me kick it, about the digits, that I've collected
Long distance, and disconnected, it's gettin hectic
Before my record, they didn't show it
But now they throw it, hopin that they'll get drunk off Moet
or Cristal, but that's not my par-ticular style and taste
My name ain't Puff and I ain't got loot to waste
I ain't got time to waste, bad bitches is all up in my face
Crazy ignorant, sweatin links minks and shit
Cosmetic, but deep down, derelict
Fake players, never get out the projects
It's pathetic -- the way she bends for dividends
I tried to jewel her but she tried to get a drink at the end
of our con-vo-sation, I did not have the patience
Slid off to the next Asian
She said, ""What you do?""  I said, ""What?""
She said, ""You know your occupation?""
So I broke the fuck out
In nineteen-ninety-six that's what it's all about, but
I won't go that route
Back in the days Biz said it was The Vapors
But today, I realize that it's the papers

""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""

Now a whore's a whore, find a queen and she'll be my Earth
Respect love and protect her, for all that it's worth
I admit I have flaws, I flips it first, but deep down
I wishes to give em the universe
A lot of the ones that I thought was right wasn't
I build with Afu, he said ""Don't sweat it cause
they come a dime a dozen""
Like my ex-stunt, wanted a diamond
Bitches love power, while queens, love refinement
Low stress environment, old age and retirement
Never have to wonder where my money went
Where my honey went, is her back gettin twisted
by the next fella, always take heed to what I tell her
When I'm wrong, she lets me know I need correction
When I'm right she's my reflection still we, use protection
Through thick and thin, thin and thick
She's my diamond in the rough not a whore or a trick
Great expectations, of me and she buildin nation
Everything we do and skyscrapin
Back in the days, the devil used to rape her
Nowadays, he got her chasin the paper

""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
 See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""

Jeru the Damaja,"One day about six 'o clock I'm woke up
By the sound of my buzzer and a car or a truck
Screechin' off, so I jump up, scratch my nuts
But when I'm like ""Who's that?"" nobody speaks up
So I go to the door there's a note it says:
""We have Hip-Hop hostage with guns to his throat,
Do the right thing and we might let him go,
But if you call the police, that's all she wrote
You know what the motive is, it's all about dough
And in case ya think we bullshittin' here's the photo.""
I couldn't recognize the clows because they was all hooded down
But I peeped Foxy Brown sippin' Cristal in the background
With fake alligator boots on
And smack dab in the middle was hip-hop with a Versace suit on
I immediately called Primo
I said ""Hip-Hop is in trouble, meet me at my rest on the double
Don't even jump in the shower, matta'fact scratch my rest
Meet me and D & D in an half an hour
And bring all ya shit wit' you 'cause you know what we got to do.""
Yo Afu! (Whassup?) Lets jet-son like Elroy
If I recall correctly I last saw hip-hop down at Bad Boy
We'll see if Puff knows whassup
'cause he's the one gettin' him drunk and fuckin' his mind up
We go to the office, he's nowhere to be found
So we snatch up Jay Black and beat his bitch ass down
""Now where's Hip-Hop?!""  ""Aaight, aaight..."" he confessed:
""Suge came and took him from Puff last night,
He said he'd give him up if a real nigga came to retrieve 'em...""
So we went to L.A. later that evenin'
When we got there, everything was aaight
And we brought Hip-Hop back home that night.

It's been awhile since I escaped the library 
fightin ignorance everyday its gettin weary 
when I think I got him 
he pulls a slip on me 
and theres so many soldiers 
in his fiendous ass army 
One of the fiercest, is this nigga named Tricknology 
the last time we met, he got the drop on me 
shit happens so fast he even got some of my family 
blasted my way up out the building 
when I catch him Im gon kill him 
track him uptown, where I hear he's lyin to children 
1-2-5th's the stop, go outside I hear gunshots 
run up the block 
greedy Lou's dead infront of the materialistic crack spot 
Trick's yellin out this is my block 
I would've hit him, but I didn't have a clear shot 
an innocent bystander might get popped 
Damn....a small thang cuz the prophet still cant be stopped 


What...thats right, this is my motherfuckin life 
Trick-nol-ogy, you know what Im sayin 
you know me, you can't front on me.... 

Verse 2 
Im in a fucked up position 
but if he squeezes again, Im gon lift em 
a few seconds later now here comes the siren 
oh shit its the pork chop patrol 
their on Ignorance's payroll 
and they only came to hold... 
Tricknolog down, scoup Greedy Lou off the ground 
throw him in the back of a truck 
one yells 'What the fuck nigga ya lookin at? 
now get the fuck outta here' 
then I get that feeling that I feel when danger is in the air 
then out of nowhere one yells the Prophets over there 
immediatly following mad led is in the air 
picture all posted up like they knew I'd be here 
I'd go for what I know 
but shit there everywhere 
through in the back and forth my gun gets lost 
but I managed to get one high powered thought off 
I split 6 pigs that got sawed off 
as their bodies break south I proceed to break north 
now shit is lookin dim and you'd think all maybe lost 
but the Prophet won't go out at any cost

still I need medical attention 
but Im not bitchin ,gettin Ignorance is my mission 
all of a sudden Greedy Lou comes creepin 
around the corner talkin bout..Prophet your a gonna 
We knew you followed Trick uptown because you wanna

'cause it's just like, whatever, you know what I'm sayin'?  (Whatever)

First Verse

It's too strategical and mathematical
I rotate so fast that I appear invisible
I keep it chemical, but never subliminal
The force centrifugal and spiritual
You got static?  Get grounded, 'cause I've mastered electrical
Mostly mental, but don't sleep on the physical
Ignorance got'em chatterin', one even said I was a son to him
Still my LP is fatter than
his or yours, took a two-year pause
Now that I'm back on the set my foes drop like hoe's drawers
in a brothel, only dealin' with what's logical
Applied science left MC's penetrable
The leader's stroke is apocalyptic
Hostile like Arabics in Israel with automatics
And if you want it, the Monks can make it hectic
Set it off, fire burn up Jack Frost and Santa Claus
Whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Primo Scratching]

(Unknown): ""And to all y'all crews...whatever""

Second Verse

Bound to blow up, but never disintegratin'
The ultimate MC equation
Ferromagnetic, ask my pops, it's genetic
That's why I'm a weedhead and not an alcoholic
Call it whatever you want to call it
Devils just know that it's some form of arithmetic
Hieroglyphic, 'cause you can picture this shit
The state of hip-hop today is like hookers in politics
Got MCin' locked down like a convict
Blowin' up opposition as I maneuver through it
And to make sure it's overstood, I stick around
Popular like crime in ghetto neighbourhoods
Rock my crown like Shaka did, hold it down
Fuck your mind up like Joe Jackson, kids, check it out
So whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Primo scratching]

Lord Finesse: ""I gotta do my thing...I represent""
(Unknown): ""And to all y'all crews, whatever""

Third Verse

Fire, flames, heat up the competition
Spontaneous combustion, like the Pope's religion
your style of emceein' is Paganism
Your rhymes make no sense, just like a Roman Christian
But your niggas soup you up like Lipton
The Gwong Jan Lin of underground emceein' strikes again
The snake bites again, but I'm immune to the poisonous
venom, ask the devil, he knows I'm dangerous
Freak on the mic, but not sexual
Call me unalike 'cause my rhymes are never homo
Make you sad, like when Cher left Sonny Bono
Fire burn Giuliani, Pataki and Cuomo
Whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Primo Scratching]

Lord Finesse: ""I gotta do my thing...I represent""

Jeru the Damaja,"Let us now discuss the mental attitude
The mental must always stay clam
You must let nothing move you
Be it good or bad

But when the mental and I be moved
There is no longer good or bad, there just is
When there just is
You have the power to form and shape

So now witness
The wrath of the math
Tell me when you ready
I'm ready",Wrath of the Math,1996
Jeru the Damaja,"Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

So all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
And all those skin tight jeans hon you're playin' yaself
And all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

And all those hooker type wears baby you're playin' yaself
And all that big gun talk money you're playin' yaself

Jeru the Damaja,"(""Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me an my dreams
 See what I mean black? I gets the paper"")

Microphone thugs flip keys and shit
Remember the 80's when niggas was acting crazy?
The mean streets raised me
I used to live dangerously
Admist crack-selling armed dangerous felons
Plus murderers, drug spot burglars
Niggas doing anything to acquire that paper
Live the life of crime but got saved by the rhyme
Peace to all my niggas doing time on top of time
Plus the ones gunned down in their prime
I made it this far because of divine design
Diamond chains the sun still outshines
I get you drunk off my drink like that champaigne wine
As long as there's breath left, I father the fatherless
If shit was real Brooklyn would snatch that chain off your chest
Don't fess, we know why you rock that vest
Hard on records, but really pussy, check it
I do this for me, and not the paper, strictly 100%

(""Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me an my dreams
 See what I mean black? I gets the paper"")

It started way before Super Rhymes
Peace to mom dukes for enduring hard times
God bless all the victims of my past life crimes
I do this for the ghetto youth living like Good Times
Flipping rhymes saved me from the obvious traps
In '97 studio hustlers puch crack on wax
And breaking backs, but faking jacks
If it wasn't for contracts, they wouldn't bust caps
So, destroy your people and collect huge stacks
Fat axe, and platinum plaques
Come bring it back, rewind it that old gangster bullshit
Got the youth running around criminal minded
Not a player hater, just don't chase the paper
Got a little deal so some heads caught the vapors
So stupid motherfuckers throw your guns in the air
To all my niggas that ain't make it past their 19th year
I do it for me, and not the paper, stictly 100%, nah mean?

(""Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me an my dreams
 See what I mean black? I gets the paper"")

Sinister plots, every week who got shot
Spots like the Enterprise kept the neighborhood hot
Niggas bugging out so some receive toe tags
Resting up north with fag or sporting shit bags
When I think back it's so sad
All the niggas that I had, who'd ever figure that it'd get so bad?
So I retreat with a pen and a pad
Hide your chain when you ride the train
For writing rhymes about automatic weapons
I'd rather steer the youth in the right direction
Drop a bomb, destroy the temple's ?sen section?
Little girls already sexing
Hard rock shorties is flexing
But I stick to my lessons, no stress
Cause if shit was real, Brooklyn would snatch that chain off your chest
Don't fess, we know why you rock that vest
Hard on records, but really pussy, check it
I do this for me, and not the paper, strictly 100%, know what I'm saying?

Spent the rest of my life writing down ways to get her
I really didn't know what I was doin back then
But now my g's so tight I flip her and her friends
And bring those mic pimps - they ain't no match
Flippin like tricks, the ones I smash know it's no strings attached
Fake players, flash trappings, some fall for the booty
I finesse 'em on they back and aim an inch above the booty
When I rip, they can get freaky like a porno movie
I rock it like Jet Li, you beat it like Hong Kong Phooey
You a cartoon character like Huey, Dewey or Louie
With the mic thrust I tear it down like a tsunami
Destroy the walls like a one man army
That's why you pay to (?) and I funk for free

Jeru the Damaja,"I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your jaw
You probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the mutha fuckin' man",I'm the Man,1999
Jeru the Damaja,"Last year record companies were chumpin me
But now like chicks they all be up on me
and me so horny, I hit em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out

Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that?  Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it

Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
and all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her
cause she be working on my nerves
and yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
and I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all
With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath
And stay the fuck out my path",Speak Ya Clout,1999
Jeru the Damaja,"It's the sinister sister, leave mics so hot make hands blister
Try to catch me but all you heard was ""Damn you just missed her""
Daily means and whereabouts, more secret than a whisper
Cut sharper than a scissor, lookin for the love elixir
Like most listeners, let them know it's all in they reach
Spittin my verbal attack with the impeccable speech
How bout niggas, gotta keep your dog on a short leesh
Got 'head speak, If not they try to play us like suckas
The most commitment, wanted non commitment givin mothafuckas
Not sayin that all men fall in this category
But one look in his eyes and I can tell they whole story
Lookin for a friend or wife for late nate creep if he's horny
If he's sincere, got G, or pick up lines that corny
Tryin to say that he adore me, when he don't even know me
That type of weak game will leave a nigga, poor broke & lonely
Willin to go and stick anything that let's em stick 'em
'Cause through all that bullshit, he's lookin for anotha victim

Brrr, stick 'em, hahaha stick 'em
Brrr, brrr, stick 'em, hahaha, stick 'em
Brrr, stick 'em, hahaha stick 'em

Perfect example, it was like Monday the 10th
Late afternoon, just on my king and it was time well spent
In any event, this niggas eyein me, it's evident
Try hard to cement, to ignore his twisted compliments
He seem hell bent for my time, a hundred percent
Asked to come to sit at my table, if I was the age of contended
And no why he would put himself through such torment
And despite the corny line, you could see the extent
That he would go, said he'd pay my rent, dress me and give me dough
Follow by cants and comments bout my bodies measurements
I said ""I don't drink moet, take loot to get bent
Or use niggas to pay rent, I'm independent""
His response that ""You heaven sent
But I haven't met a chick that ain't have a price yet""
I said ""Well, I must be a different type of female
While bitches waitin to exhale, I plot schemes to black male
Talkin bout, you wash your car, who you knew and your wealth""
A new expirement, thinkin this niggas playin himself
With just his arogance, not to exclude his rude attitude
How he pursued, relentless references to seein me nude
The wrong move, this jiggy nigga really thinks he's smooth
Like he got somethin to prove, and I got nothin to lose
I know his style, never ran into a femme fatale
Like you hearin right now, comin through ya ear canal
I smile politely, so as not to blow my cover
Carryin on conversation, knowin that I'm on some other shit
Should have stopped when he had the chance to quit
Talkin about his income, and how bout he want to get some
Next time we meet, he'll just be the next victim

[Chorus]

Like my girl Nina, bangin body and she was cute
But she'd only fuck with niggas if they had mad loot
Plenty ice, nice ride, but she'd always have to drive
Trying to compesate the shit, that as a youth she was deprived
She survived, only to end up to being 85
Talkin bout I played that nigga, keep it real baby...",Anotha Victim,1999

This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Avoid jail legend, fingerprints on full metal
Jackets like design, so that you can't hack it
But you mustn't get caught up in these devilish tactics
Never let the man pull ya string like Geppetto
The game's the same, Boricua or Moreno
Don't watch ya step and you be like, mi amigo
Forensics made the maps, so now he's on death row
Yo what's the steelo, real brothers do it on the d-low
Knowing's have the battle, so now you know
To be on point, 'cause anybody can be a casualty
Some brothers lost there life, fuckin' with O-P-P
Um robbery and P-C-P
From the cradle to the state penitentiary
He'll be in the middle of next century
Ask me, is it crying sakne
You got to watch how you flow and you will grow
If not you get tripped up in the ghetto

This is for the ghetto, black love, black love

Sellin' yae yo, playin' see-lo, duckin' po-po
Some brothers got murdered over a kilo
Five zero ask questions, but nobody know
What's the M-O, another brother trying to get dough
Be careful how you live, 'cause that's how you go
Wild like Rambo, get shot down by the Commando
Call your co-defendant sing like D'Angelo
No problemo, but upstate you sing soprano
Police sadimize, a man at the seven oh
Be careful where you go yo, and just in case you ain't know
I flow, to liberate the ghetto

[Chorus: x4]

This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Trying to be like Pablo, DeNiro, Al Pacino
You be all right until you run up on Colombo
Get caught red handed, so you got to go
You lose the crib, the car, the women and the dough
This can't be happenin' so you like ""Oh No""
So avoid this fate, and absorb the conscious flow
This is not a demo, strictly for the ghetto
Not the limo, work for the pimp, hustler and the ho
And I'm gonna let you know
Whether you as black as jack or brown as Nino
Black Love, is what we need to flow
From the ghetto

[Chorus: x4]

Jeru the Damaja,"What niggas deal, they last 24 I did in the first
Before the doctor cleaned off the afterbirth
I kicked a verse, smoked a blunt, shooked the Earth
Smacked the physician, and fucked the nurse
The truth hurts, like a sword in the hand of this expert
Cuttin through your soul, like your best friend did your dirt
Mental like physical blows destroy ego's
Your style is Babylonian, like dicks in assholes
The drama unfolds, don't mean nothing up my nose
I can't stand snow, it only blows like nitro
Blistering, my flows I'm splittin, so I hope you listening 
Super shoutout to all my niggas in prison
Shout to the pyramids, the cypher and scription
Science fact not fiction, I cut with precision
Speak multiplication, subration, addition
Division, Great Solar Stance burns compition

""This-this-this-this is the Showdown""

I put you in the chicken wing like Bob Backlund, 
jack ya team captain
Bring drama like summer night, ghetto action
Some honies got it twisted, fat asses I mash 'em
Cops like jewels, back in the days I snatch 'em
You catch a tantrem, date how the raws rockin the drum
Float like the white lotus, kill like Whitey in Vietnam
You should peel arm, gorilla tactics like Viacom
Set shit on fire like a bomb, up in smoke like Cheech & Chong
True blacks too strong can't let nothin stand in my way
Shit will get thick like Juice 60 in Friday
In Brooklyn, kill MC's like Captain Hook your children
To rappers I'm a villain, fill esteem wan't my secret like Samson
Picture so hard, I stunt your grandson son
Teleport from Coast To Coast like Spaceghost
Like soy butter on my breakfast toast
And when It comes to makin it nasty, I flips it the most

""This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown""
""This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown""

Setting it off like pistols in the projects
The climax hold ya six like nasty hot wet sex
But string tech I catch wreck, ejucalate when I inject
Not a player hatter, regulator, trick niggas get checked
When I resurrect hip hop, you know the bullshit stop
Like you got the oo-wop, the pops and what nots
Fruity like Ed Koch, ya straight boo-tops, I'm top notch
Super funky like a derelict prostitute prop
Ya hear gun shots, the coroner shows up to take flicks
Shit is feet, but no feet shit like chicks with dicks
Ya throat flip too quick, to blaze magnetic
Paramedics roll up on the scene, 
it's tragic, don't deal with Magic
Johnson, renegade like Charles Bronson
Packing a force like 18 Bronzemen

Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Come on, all the way

{Miz Marvel}
The first verse, perfect design conquest your desert thirst
Highly blessed, can't recept the evil luers curse
From the mansion to the slums, where the evil luers lurk
My life's work, want it so bad it hurts
I see three of a side, like nipples through at church
Mic experts, manipulate out through the universe
Bitches wit dicks, reveal how niggas livin in skirts
Perverts, I put to death and throw to hell head first
My word is plated gold, isin't equal the work
Mental birth can show signs of movin Heaven and Earth
Never deal or take car, wear your heart in your dirt
Rhymes baptised in fire and never been burnt

[Chorus]
{Miz Marvel}
As I flex, on the set we ghetto intellect
My minds def, twice that of an all time vet
Quietest cat, rock around with no concept
Hit the L start choking and sleep with one eye open
You can try me, until I can get under your skin like poison ivy
Words invincible, hit it strictly for the pledgin principal
Continual, pen is like my sword I feel the armor
Hypnotic melodies, never gympsy steak charmer
Hearts is eye, blaze a stronger than a marijuana
You think I'm done, no, got dot.comma
My persona, change your heart to ghetto primadonnas
With maddic overdose like that guy from Nirvana
Time was cut short, like a fair weather friend
But if they gone, then I don't need them
Can I get an amen

[Chorus]2X
{Miz Marvel}
Cast a spell, on all non believing inphadeles
Heroz4Hire, exclusive list the clientele
Make your head swell, legal spinning like a carosel
Sweet as caramel, transform into Miz Marvel
Queen lady of the Supahaman Klik Cartel
If I need a bonecrusher, call up on the sun toucher
In camouflage, gone just like a desert mirage
Try to escape the fate, safe in proper sabotage
Lyrical massage, sounded like comitcally shape
My verbal swordplay, bounces off the walls like richochets
Compete, with the style that you know your couldn't beat
And I call you niggas pussy, 'cause you are what you eat
Complete the cypher, comunicate through words unspoken
My mission ain't complete, let the circle be unbroken

[Chorus] 2X",Miz Marvel,1999
Jeru the Damaja,"This goes out to all my young brothers and sisters
Hold ya head, things ain't always what they seem
I'm about to give you a dose of reality
Real deal

Nowadays, records are played and superstars are made
Still mothers in the ghetto, rent don't get payed
As a result, bullets are sprayed and their sons are laid
It's no myth, in ghetto life, if you don't fight you fade
Surviving in the streets, not a task for ordinary men
Growing up in the hood, young black and supahuman
Caught up in the game of blocks and cops run your block
Intercourse with witches and hunted by warlocks
For props, boos-hoot pop, another brother drops
He barely knew his pops, 
now his little seed will barely know his pops
Tunnel vision like a cyclops
I give you x-ray vision with these supahuman eye drops
My niggas in the ghetto, give it everything you got
'cause until we reach the top, can't stop and won't stop

[Chorus: x2]
Can you feel?
The presha, the the the presha
Hand over
The presha, the the the presha

Journalists write articles 'cause they can't write rhymes
Ever since I was a youth I dealt in crime
Now I'm trying to reach the youth, to preserve what's left
There's a fork in the road, choose life or death
There's too much stress, too many bullets for your vest
Temptress, suck ya best, exotic strains of syphillis
The rest, rest in the Earth, only the best progress
It's you who think I see commercial success
Warning, this shit is real, this is not a test
And what I express worth more than a Lexus
Serve it like baby food, still hard to digest
Long ass niggas is mental slaves, I gotta protest

[Chorus: x2]

Baby in the crib, and dad got no loot for food
So he do what he got to do
Keep it real, I don't playa hate ya
God my divine nature, 
sent at this time to stabilize the structure
We should all live like wise kings, 
now sing praise to the gutter
The blazed double X, concealed like a box cutter
Brothers should be teaching, not murdering one another
Word, to the mother land, kill the other man
Lord of the concrete jungle, and Tarzan was a black man
Swingin on vines vibin, been balancin the eco system
And since there's no more niggas in the ghetto, here I am

[Chorus: x4]

(You got to deal with, instead of hand over)

Benzes, blue and green contact lenses

Knowin who your friends is, millionaire dollar shoppin benjeses
Ya money how much them timbs is

Niggas is fake and rough, but sleep like spar
To cuss, bust, dutch us and bringin the ruckus
Money makin brothers want to fight and fuss
Cruisin out my flesh light, plus make playas look ridiculous
Trying hard, but can't stop the bumrush
Sun trust, all the temples I crush, ya must back up
Spontaneous combustion
Forty five freaks inside my dungeon
When I get paid I want it in alumson
Lick a shot and cause pandemonium

In the time when hip hop was strong
The Supahuman Klik ruled the land
Bringin that futuristic hip hop, presently in time
The first lieutenant in arms of the Supahuman Klik
Was the all mighty, all powerful, Miz Marvel
I think she can describe it how she does better

{Miz Marvel}
Thought I disappeared now that the smoke has cleared
I come from times with inabitions, face to face with fears
While shootin stars wishing that I can shift my gears
So I raise my glass eye, I drink to that, say cheers
And let the fire water wash away the tears, burn like salt
On open wounds, thoughts consume all consetions
Give birth to these rhymes like an oral see-section
Uhh, positive connection throughout the galaxy
Time to switch to reality, make proper arrangements
for the souls of fatalities
It's the same for niggas that stuck with that slave mentality
Or these wack ass rappers, they got no originality
But my mentality, helps me travel around the galaxy
Time gets shorter, I'm on the water, run insanity
It seems like everyone was after me
Three's a nasty girl like Vanity
Make niggas wild, I smoke la, anything to keep my sanity
Ain't got no friends, everyone with me is family
If they standing next to me, nothing's what it seems to be
Sending energy, when I rhyme, but no time for idol questions
If freestyling is my bible, when I fall in hip hop sessions
Of the tribal blessings, lessons to be learned
Respect had to be earned and not given
On the fourth of them but not amongst the men that living
Guy collides, when selfish minds can't asked to be forgiven
Ain't no turning back the hands of time, 
when past spirits have risen

Into it seems like magic mushrooms, from the womb to the tomb
I got a meetin in the ladies room, I be back real soon
O-o-oh o-o-o-oh
And all pro, precise position, like a crossbow
To strike the deathblow, continue with a never ending flow
Friend or foe, gas heads go from C.E.O. to skid row
See the toxic green flow, it's poison waters overflow
Paint a mental picture, lyrical Michaelangelo
Words pierced with the sting of a scorpio
Beats mad bong, to collapse the Walls of Jericho
Overflow and explore, I hope you got your blunts rolled
'cause this is the same, no matter which zip code
My minds pro, bitches is robbed, 
suckin the diamonds out your ear lobe
I keep it tracked like a barcode of Illuminati
And fight these devils back with the Code of Hammurabi

With no remorse, I tap the source and knock you off ya high horse

Never sworn not to make the same mistakes as there parents
Written on there face, time worn sharpen then a poison desert storm
Step on first month Capricorn, quiet storm

Elegants ruffness and innocence, if ever given a form
Hell have a fury like a women's scorn

Give me any platform and I perform lyrical quiet storms
I make it hot, you keep it luke warm
From hotels to college dorms, keep these niggas souls torned

And words of truth, put shoes on their feet

Rodney King's a millionaire, but he ain't get his ass beat

And he's only spinning that real hip hop
Don't be late bop, eleven on the dot, honies flot
It's more dips then dicks, and nobody get shot
Stay here a little minute, then go harvest my crop
By the moonlight, get lifted and call it a night
But first I bump in this princess named Shaniqua Albright
She was lookin mad right, and her body was mad tight
Total control of my will, she couldn't put up a fight
She said if you wan't me take, 'cause I have an early flight
Wiffie's waitin up, so I let her go on her way

Or on video get caught you'll know who turned State's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints

Tight case for the DA from here to down South

Their ass is all hangin' out, playin the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted

When niggas is kickin' that old off the wall shit, let em know

So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always fakin' moves, never, makin' moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breakin' down
You fools, you work all week and give the devil back his loot
For jewels, and the steak on your plate is filled
With chemicals, still, brothers leave brothers
All battered and bruised, on the streets
Won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

Shinin' star but not a movie actress
Mind refined, skintone many shades of blackness
And every man want to have this, because she's the baddest
And her booty it got the fatness
Many come with excess bagage from broken homes
To heal her dome I wrote these poems
And most love to talk on the phone
The real ones they either love you or they leave you alone
Act childish even though they fullgrown
Some jump badge you gotta be like: shorty watch ya tone
Causin' commotion cause the species deal with emotion
No matter how dope they are they put you through the motion
Some move real fast and others in slow motion
The ones that's upset they have they granny fix some love potion
Some love flowers most smell like baby lotion
Some so ill they have a player talkin' love and devotion
The ones that been done wrong watch how you approach 'em
And save those phoney lines they can tell if you genuine
No matter how un-coachable I can coach you
I need to form my team...my black queen

The way she walk get me caught up everytime
Damn honey mad fine on some Sade shit is it a crime
The way she shake doubletape makes you break ya neck
Women little or nothing talkin' about she want respect
You gettin' weak she eat you up and gingerly step
But if it's tight then you just might get her in check
But come correct and don't have the wrong one have ya baby
Ask her how many niggaz she want she'll probably say three
Some love to love you some love to spend money
I'm crazy tight with my loot but she can get all my honey
My man doin' life behind ears and that ain't funny
And the sky is the limit if they find themselves a dummy
Most like exquisit gear but they crib look mad bummy
Believe in T.V. with no concept of reality..my black queen

Ancient universal symbol of fertility, black soil
Wicked royal and loyal her skin mask moves from baby oil
She makes my temper boil I'm bound of her duty
Whether she got a real fat, or real flat booty
Due love the now man woman and child she makes me smile
All those show her conference try to copy her style
Mothers watch my sisters and nieces
As I grow older my respect for her increases
If she a hoe I scoop up and teach her like Jesus
My excistance without her is meaningless
My goal is more than to get her undressed
I mentally caress this goddess, pittoresque the nubian princess
See I once called her a bitch but she is a empress
And I can't live without her this I must confess
And thought sometimes she fills my life with stress
Nevertheless I love her to death...my black queen

[Verse 1: Jeru]
War, my skills is this spelled backwards
I perform for the white kids but do this for the black kids
To get this ill takes practice I'm takin' over
the industry with ghetto verbal and tactics
Hard times build muscle like lactic acid
Some entertainers losin' they minds
makin' porns pissin' on kids
The streets is ill save the theatrics
I still treat a bitch like a bitch
while y'all niggaz is doin' backflips
I can't trip I guess it's part of the game
like Ja-Rule bitin' my name
like MJ glowin' up in flames
like chickens suckin' dick for fame
As things change I remain the same
tryin' to keep sane
While many strugglin' to maintain
The stress of ghetto livin' can bust ya brain
It seems the road is paved with less joy than pain
I want to regress but I refrain
If I don't I rage war
Right here in the streets of New York
Some talk the talk, but don't walk the walk
Like Muslems at the corner store sellin' pork
My little brother still outlined in chalk
They went from forties to the champagne court
Videos and true lies makin' all the birds squalk
Little girls butt naked so the president's stalk
My man say he was god holdin' the devil's pitchfork
That's why I'm throwin' rhymes like Geronimo's tomahawk

[Verse 2: Jeru]
War, many shout it but don't want to see it
I stay low and lay boobytraps like the cong in Viet..nam
Loud talkin' and stares can't do me harm
Know some niggaz want to stop it I'm still droppin' the bomb
Shit is death like Tennessaucee ring the alarm (ring the alarm)
It's still a mystery to you like the 82nd psalm
Some fight 'til the end some sell out like Uncle Tom
So much contempt others that's flow with they jelly like napalm
War, is more than hand to hand and firearms
It's only won when the mind is calm
So I study Sun-Tzu and stopped smokin' chron'
In my left hand riches, long life in my right palm

Jeru the Damaja,"3 in the morning, you hop on the train
3 Brooklyn fiends is scheming on your chain
Mad blunts and licks to the head, you red[?]
Better sober up quick or you might get dead
There's no one around so ain't no reason to scream out
Here's your chance to be a gangsta nigga, back that thing out
The next move you make will decide your fate
Will it be die on the train or live life behind the gate
You framing[?] minor[?] [??], you contemplate prison rate
Your heart skip a beat and you select upstate
It's on, you get a lump in your throat, niggaz weapons are drawn
You so shook, you shoot straight through your coat
2 down, 1 boogie[?] but before you gone
The train stops and one of New York City's Finest jumps on

""Whatchu gonna do.."" [sound of da police, shoots]

2:30 in the morning on a friday night
It's one of those types of nights that everything's goin right
In a club, fishing for bitches, anything tryin to bite
Then the one that you want gets caught in your sight
Face - picture perfect, big titties and fat ass
She's asked if she want to drink and she kindly pass
Her response let you know she's not the average stunt
She asks ""do you got a dutch"", you say ""yeah"", she roll a blunt
Weed[?] and conversation good, you fill the evening with laughter
Then Shorty like: ""yo, whatchu doing after""
She continues what she's doing is outta character
But, she live's alone and she wants you to smash her
You bug, you can't believe that she tryin to fuck
You like: ""let's bounce"", then you think ""Lady Luck""
You exit the club, hop up in your truck
But when you get to Brooklyn East New York, you get stuck up

""Whatchu gonna do.."" [sound of da stick up]

1 a.m. - you in the studio, dropping verses about how you flip kilos
Get paper commit murder and pimp on hoes
Crazy ice around your neck with the thugged out flows
But it sounds like game to the street wise pro's
Cause you be blabbing the [??] that you don't even know
Straight pillow talking, I hope you walk the walk
And be doing all the shit that's blasting out of shortie's walkman
The last verse is laid, your men is like [??] dope fiend
All of a sudden the sound [???] wide open
3 niggaz come in, screaming ""where the cash""
And you know the shit is real cause they ain't rocking masks
They rocking big ass canons dawg, you better think fast
Do you run what's yours or go for yours and blaaast..

Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble

You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd

Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma

And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rock smelling the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it

People were running in the stairs.
They knocked on the door, 
And then they came rushing in
With guns and no compassion, they said
'You have to come, 
One suitcase that's all, you must go now

We ran down the stairs.
Joseph wasn't fast enough, 
They kicked him and he fell, 
And he was only three.
I picked him up, and took him in my arms.
They took us to the train, 
They packed us like cattle.
Rebekah squeezed my hand, she said
'We must stay together no matter what happens'

How can I describe?
Cause when we arrived, they took Rebekah 
And the children aside, and we all cried.
She looked at me, I'll never forget her eyes, 
She said, 'I'll take care of the children'

[Chorus]
Just one of those days
Feelin so much pain
Just one of those days
Wishing that things would change
Just one of those days
I'm not feeling the same
Just one of those days 
Lord have mercy on me

[Jerzee]
When ya feelin down and out
And have so much to talk about
Just remember the Most High
Will never pass you by
When you know a miracle
Simply coming true
Isn't it funny how we don't realize 
Until it's (?)

[Chorus]

[Talk]
I'm not blind
And I can see
I can walk, talk, hear, and breathe
Father, forgive me please
For asking for the things I don't need

[Chorus]

[Talk]
Father, I ask You to shine Your Light down on me
For we are humbly asking You for Your forgiveness
Even though we always beg and complain on the simple things that we don't need
And forget about the others that can't
Walk, talk, hear, or see
All I'm asking you to do is
Open up your heart
And extend your hand
Turn around and say
I'm your friend
And when you know this deep in your heart
Then the war will end 
And love shall begin

That we all will have to come together as one

What you say and do

Goes around
Show them that

I thought it'd take me high

That we could go so far

I know that you say
No war, no war no more
No more battles to fight in this life

Tell me you'll wait till then to find
What races and grates before we explode
And maybe this time we will be fine
And our tomorrow it won't be lost within this lie

So leave me alone, before, the strain, of listening to you
Comes more, than you can bear
But maybe this time, we will, be fine
Unless, tomorrow
Will be, lost

I feel you calling me when when im alone
I feel you calling me its keeping me up
I wanna be with you now

There was a false, I swear, a thought to take me out
There was a chance, that we, could go, so far (the look in your eyes)
And know, you say, no one, no one, no more
Could better survive, in this life

Jesca Hoop,"And the tall trees all have fell down
And they scattered seeds on the ground
And one is lost and one is found
Water is moving underground

When I was a young girl
I would sleep in a tall tree
On the down of bending boughs
And from the mount of his shoulders
I would traverse the valleys
Through his dusk and dawning eyes

""I will let you in,"" says the doe to my arrow
""and you will wear my bones and my skin""
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

And in the nest from the forest
I would carry an ember
And with a burning heart we'd walk
And when he asks me to rest with him
I would lay down my fire
And in that heart we'd sing and talk

I am a racoon
And you are an owl
I will run from you in the middle of the night
And we will stike a truce in the the billowing tower
And we'll eclipse the moon with a fire light
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

You love me in my dreams
It's easier when I'm fast asleep
But I don't want you to come to me anymore
The river bed has married me
So I don't want you to come to me anymore

And out of ashes comes morning
And the ritual of bathing
In the pools at bridal falls
And from the mouth of my lover
I will drink of the river
And kiss his jade and marble walls

You have spilled the red from my heart with your arrow
And you will make my bed under the red grass
And I will give my flesh and my blood and my marrow
And you will wear my bones and my skin
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

And the tall trees all fell down
And they scattered seeds on the ground
One is lost and one is found
Water is moving underground

And you're the one who showed to me the sky
It's so much more than you and I
And darling I wish I had the time
The river is whispering goodbye

Bye",Hunting My Dress,2010

I will try to dodge the rock the valley throws

And when will your vision come

And lightning rods will guide your journey home
And revelations from a fist of bones
And when the rock weighs heavy in your soul
Just tell her that you have earned the right to know

Revealer, how to break the fever
You carried in, like these demons your kin
And you'll render it secret then

Tell me, why I suffer, tell me, why I'm here
I am haunted, I am haunted
Demons in the darkness, just make 'em disappear
I am haunted, I am haunted

White coats surround me, they inject anxiety
Nothing but a memory
Bright lights above, so fascinating
Is that a scalpel coming for me?

[Chorus]

I am the light, I am the way
Just reach out and touch me
Come take my hand, you'll understand
You know you can trust me

Come back to me, come back to me
Just follow the bright white light
I feel no pain, but it's not the same
Something is just not right

Waking up, what the hell have you done to me?
Blackened figures roam about the room
I cannot breathe, I'm sliding underground
They've buried me in my own tomb

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises

In the quiet of the railway station

Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know

I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le

And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence,2018

Possum queen by law, she's been building up estates in east l.A

Is this your first time? That's sweet
Say ""hello"" to looking-forward for me
If I could set your mind at ease
This will last forever
And when it doesn't, love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
The way I used to
If you love it, love it for what it's been
Don't miss it
Don't wish it back
Don't wish it'd last 'cause if it doesn't
Love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
Don't miss it
Don't miss it the way I miss you",Possum Queen,2018

You're caps on some letters the Devil won't recognize
You emphasize politeness
Policy got to me battered but hard to beat heart beating
And I'm deaf and I'm dumb and I'm numb
But I empathize to reconcile and save time
Screaming your feeling repeating your needs
I can read when you seethe
I repeat I know grief when I see it
Believe me, I know
Creature fear creeping up seeking the weak in us
Quit picking meat from us wolf in the sheep in us
Preaching it justice
Preaching adjustment
I should just shut up and cut the
Goddamn lights off
It's too late to turn back now
Trust me there's a few ways to renew faith
It's too late to earn those all (just)
Grab all
Grab all you came for
To rectify your nature to homeostasis
You're making a scene
You're making a scene baby
To wreck the scene
To recktify us
You're making a scene

Jess Haney,"Sugar city come home
Wizard on a weekend
Willing on a weekday
Are you kidding come on
Fed up with the prepay
Looking for a keepsake
I'm no emerald liar
Dying for a card up my sleeve
I'm the gambling kind
For higher stakes and brighter takes I'll play

I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run 'em up

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call when you can
Call me when you're close

Sugar city
Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'
That's a black out ladder
It don't matter anyhow
I'm climbing
Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates
In common we got
Good friends rolled light on split ends
Pretty magic
Traffic addicts

Now I don't really know where you stay at, can I get an address?
Never mind my phone dead forget it
I don't really know where to bake that, less you tryna get in
In which case my phone dead, forget it
And I never answer calls when I'm in the kitchen
Cooking
It's just a thing
It's out
And I never call back when my friends all looking at me in the car
'Cause it'd be all they wanna talk about
Oh you tryna to get a deal? A deal? A deal
Sorry on the real
But my eyes and my ears don't work well
And the floor keeps sliding out my heels
I can't feel 'em am I still dreaming?
Skull on the table a still life
Is this still life?
What's the meaning are we still dealing?
Feel like I can't act right
Oh right

When were you planning on coming my way?
I've been here waiting all damn day to turn the the lights down low
And turn the table on you

Jess Klein,"The air was colder
Eyes were heavy
The day a child who loved died
Your heart was choking on its sorrow
Your 13 year old innocent delight
And me I've spent my life in waiting
On one whose heart knew more than mine
And now the stars are in my window
And on my breath the moon light

Oh Romeo I can't explain this weight upon my chest
That you'd live to tell the story to a girl whose left for less
I have never cried for thinking Verona was not mine
Why am I pacing through her dusty streets?
I pray there is not tragedy this time

Oh how they'll love to claim its magic
How that somehow frees their hands
And they say they'd love to change the world
And meanwhile they watch it from the stands
But you and I are all alone here now
It's not what either of us planned
I'd be the last to think I'd learn to love
Your beauty took so long to understand

Oh Romeo I can't explain this weight upon my chest
That you'd live to tell the story to a girl whose left for less
I have never cried for thinking Verona was not mine
Why am I pacing through her dusty streets?

Jess Klein,"I can see the pain living in your eyes
And I know how hard you try
You deserve to have so much more
I can feel your heart and I sympathize
And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life

I don't want to let you down
I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back
From where you might belong
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say but good-bye
You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me


(Chorus) You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry

Though it's gonna hurt us both
There's no other way than to say good-bye",Goodbye Goodbye,2000
Jess Klein,"My lover looks me in the eye
Says baby you failed me
If your love is really true
Why don't I feel set free

Aw bail me out baby
I'm not meant for this prision cell
So I fought for him
How could I know he brought it on himself

And now I'd like to say 
Final score aside
That even though I failed in your eyes
I tried

I tried
So I bailed him out with all my cash
I bailed him out with my love
Distracted all the prision guards

With stone trumpet from up above
I even pulled the warden over to one side
I said leave for him to foreswear my penance 
For his crime

And now I'd like to say
Final score aside
Even though I failed in your eyes
I tried

I tried it
And with all the pain in this world
That my love could go to change
How could I fail at freeing only one man from his own cage

And though it hurts to think of him
Cursing me for one thing
And it hurts to think of me
No longer believing

But in the end they told me
Sorry he isn't good enough
And it finally occurred to me
Why his life is so damn rough

And now I'd like to say
Final score aside
That even though I failed in your eyes
I know I hurt you maybe a lot

The stars look all too near
Flowers on the razor wire
I know you're here
We are few
And far between
I was thinking about her skin
Love is a many splintered thing
Don't be afraid now
Just walk on in

(Walk on in)
Her eyes were cobalt red
Her voice was cobalt blue
I see no purple light
Crashing out of you
So just walk on in

Her lovers queued up in the hallway
I heard them scratching at the door
I tried to tell her
About Marx and Engels, God and Angels
I don't really know what for
But she looked good in ribbons
So just walk on in
She looked good in ribbons
So just walk on in

Tie a red red red red red red ribbon
Love is a many splintered thing
Tie a red red red red ribbon
Don't be afraid
Just walk on in

Just walk on in

Just walk on in
