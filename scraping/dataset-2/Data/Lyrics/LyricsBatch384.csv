Insane Clown Posse,"To all that are receiving this broadcast, we are now entering the
Thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage
This ongoing event has now been upgraded to a national emergency
It has been a sleepless night past Metro Detroit as panic and terror

Has swept the streets it seems much of Detroit as well as
The rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable
Cloud that still clutches the sky from New York to Honolulu
Miami to Fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided

But a wall of darkness and artificial night still grips the land
Witnesses now tell us thousands upon thousands of people
Are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are painted
And and and they look like clowns

The people are running and screaming but eye witnesses say
They're not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy has overtaken them
At this time we do not know where or why the people are running
But there seems to be an organized plan directing there action

It's like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina
The immense crowd of clowns are now on the move all in unison
Moving in one direction towards an unknown destination
Almost as if they see what others cannot heeding an inaudible call
That silently pierces this calm before the storm

Insane Clown Posse,"Welcome... to the Madhouse...
Here ghost wail and moan
Skeletons rattle trying to escape there prisoning coffins (Wicked Shit)
Grimlins and skulls gasp a death (ICP Tech N9ne)
You have enterd the Mad House

Sombody open the fuckin door and let me in!
The worlds are about to get me again
Shit ain't pretend I'm safer in the madhouse
Clinging to the selene like a spider
I'm out of your mind like frozen fire
Razorblade fingers scratchin my neck
Lost in the maze I found a dragon barbeque in the back
A arm came out of the toilet and squaws my balls
That shirt hurt got me head but holes in the walls
I wanna see you!
I hear you!
I catch spirits and ghosts by there invisible throats and then tear through (tear through)
Never scary boo bitch I'm a kamikaze
Swimmin through the living room watching joni and chachi
And then I realize I'm potsy trapped in the tv 
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me

Your ain't never gettin in and we ain't never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Your ain't never gettin in and we ain't never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

So many dimensions and lines except for these levels of dips and devil
Ain't been alright sense the ghetto better wait for my temper settle
Cause my mind is a madhouse the n9ne fittin spaz out
Player haters don't throw stones if you grind in a glass house
Sometimes when I lash out I pass out how sick and insanse and vain can this be
Wanna fly your little head like a frisbee six six triple eight forty six ninede nine thrisde
This strange and psychopathic homie this is not disney
The madhouse continues to pin you send you psycho bitches to the back of the venue
Then you slitther when like when I'm here in you or off in you
Then my homies 2 dope and Jay do you up somthin real ???
Level of madness extasy shrooms and acid
Beats release but you can't find me in lake placid
Finnaly in missouri dissily struttin with a bad bitch 
Her last kid was disastres ICP on some Mad Shit!

Your ain't never gettin in and we ain't never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Mad...House... Mad House
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

Peekaboo anybody home? where you at?
Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me mutha facka I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror or a different person he was grabbin his nuts and spittin and curseing at me fag!
There somethings in this life that I fail to understand even as even as a grown man I don't comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs and some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl with my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm
What the fuck not a damn single bitch in this place but some ones figgin my nuts
I got it done well sittin with my pants around my ankles dry humpin my hand
A lot of mother fucker claim the insanity plead but not me 
Its this house that's gone mad I'm insane as can be!

Your ain't never gettin in and we ain't never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Mad...House... Mad House
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse! (Let me out the Madhouse)
Let me out the Madhouse
Let me out the Madhouse

Insane Clown Posse,"Let me in this bitch. Let me get some change shit. Man fuck this dress code bitch. I can dance
Muthafucka. I can daaannncccee.

I'm on crack, Walkin alleyways downtown, people drop change so I'm checkin the ground behind a
Nightclub, I can hear the bump outside I hear em' laughin' and drinkin' and dancin' getin' live and
I'm lonely, graspin' on my 55 cent, I don't know where my meds went, they been spent and I'm bent, I
Don't remember yesterday at all, I'm barkin at the moon as I'm pissin' on the wall, people grippin'
New cars checkin' out a few bars, they see me comin' side step a few yards I'm like a bad man, holdin'
Out my crusty ass hands scouldin' an imaginary friend scary and I'm blackin' out just about to lose
All hope, I was peerin through the window of a nightclub scopin', and there she was everything I
Planned for on the spotlight on the dance floor gravitatin'

[Chorus]
She kept her rythum her feet to the floor she dipped down she did the twirl and she shook it some
More she's ruby. She made me happy I tried to refrain I walk off but then I run right back I'm at it
Again she's callin'

I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle, carjacked a mini-van and punched full throttle right back
To the spot then I waited to get her, but when she came out, she had a bitch-boy wit' her no problem,
Hit the pipe and follow em' home and my imaginary friend gone have to leave me alone cause this really
Goin' down I feel it pullin me home knowin I'm a wicked clown I gotta throw it down, she pulled in her
And her fuck ass strolled in, I hit the pipe again and jump out the stolen, jumpin through back yards
Clumsey and trippin', it don't matter where ya go there's a throat slingin', and the way she danced
Split flames burnin me alive out here quit playin games I'm on the side of her house lookin in through
The back den and there she was with him again dancin'

[Chorus]

I walk right in through the front door unlocked, no gun cocked, cinder block, clown paint, I came
Here to dance boogy, umph ahhh, and maybe tap a little nookie, I'm creepin music bumpin in the back,
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack, and here come the punk bout to get champaighned, I
Take the rock and pop em' with the damn thang, hit em' in the back of the head, he dropped the wine
But I caught him in time I had to take his life with a steak knife, I washed it off and put it back
I'm keepin' the place nice I'm comin bitch you want an olive or somethin' I'm fuckin' straight out the
Streets but I'm down with some frontin' I want to tango, but instead I'm still outside the club and it's
All in my head.

Insane Clown Posse,"I've lived one hell of a life
If youre to take it tonight.
I've lived the life of a king.
But so much to darken my life.
Looking 360 degrees
200,000 diseased
How can I lay back and chill
So many down on their knees

But then again who am I
I'm just some typical guy
I ain't no fuckin hero
I've just been wondering why

I've seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a childs mistake

I never question the book
But lets say I live by the book
I'd never eat meat on tuesdays
How much bigger would my wings look

I try to pray everyday
But sometimes get lost on the way
I've seen the holiest spirit
So much to mislead the way

I've gave the visions I got
I've been told I'm gonna rot
Inside the devils intestines
I'm still here holding my spot

I've just been wondering why
I've just been wondering why

I've seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a childs mistake

Come on and open up your door
What if it's a purgatory door?
Come on and open up your door
What if it's a purgatory door?

I've seen some children crossing thy bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a childs mistake

I never really thought about how horrible it really is
Laying in a coffin in a pine black box
The only sound being that of my heart if I'm alive
But I've got no pulse of ever breath for days
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze
But I do recall the funeral them lowering me in
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in
I tried to move my fingers or somethin
Got nothin but dirt hitting the top from them shoveling

Mama a fortune tella, azmerella zella
Anyway they had sex on a oija board
And I was born the next day
(who?) violent j
When I was 14 I tripped on the train track
And I was crushed right there, on the steel rack
I'm out cold, they though it would fuck me up
I got up and itched my butt, and I'm like, what?
Everybody tripped and called me the clown devil boy,
Child of the witch heifer, whatever
Tied me up burned me and threw stones
Had a few scrapes and cuts, smokey nuts
After that they started bowin and shit
Prayin to me, you know how those primitives get
I said get off my dick I ain't a savior
I'm what ya call a juggalo, and all I want is my flava
4 simple things in this bitch before I die

I want a rusty ax
I want to know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridget
And a little sip of faygo too
Till I get my shit in this motha fucka
I will neva die!

(ah, hell yeah, so anyway...)
50 years passed all my homey's are old ass fucks
I ain't even got hair on my nuts
I left the village in the search of my ends,
I wrestled alligators, battled terminators
Nothin ever killed me, nothin could harm me
I fought in the civil war, yankees army
I walked across enemy lines with a mack 10
Man they didn't even have that shit back then
How you just gonna come in my shit and fuck it up?
Well at least make this shit sound real man, damn!
I walked acrossed enemy lines with a, lantern
Steddy takin cannon balls, to the balls
The war ended, I traveled the country horse back
Until this fool tried to horse jack
He put his gat to my head and blew my face up
Didn't even smear the makeup
I took his gun a put a divet in his neck
The sheriff didn't like it, I got endited
87 long years in the state pen
Till they finally forgot why they put me in
They had to let me go, can't hold me on nothin
On they way out they like,
""yo ain't you like a houndred and somethin?""
I'm said yeah that's right,
And I ain't gonna die till I get my shit motha
Fucka!!!

I want a rusty ax
I want to know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridget
Just a little sip or two
Till I get my shit in this motha fucka
I will neva die!

I slept under bridges, lived in a valley
I climbed up mountains, searched the alleys
More years passed and I still ain't died
Now I'm in Detroit on the southwest side
My homie has an impala blue '67
Last night we hit the road pushin one eleven
I stuck my head out the window,
Told 'em forward the most
And let my nugget ping off a light post
Hahahaha hell yeah 'cause,
Yeah it hurts a little bit but then ya gotta straight buzz
The world hates me 'cause of shit like this
They always try and kill me but, miss
I know it's odd 'cause my face is forever painted
When I was born the bitch ass doctor fainted
My tongues a little long I choke people with it
Looks kinda nasty, but chicks dig it
And I told ya my neck can stretch for miles
I sorta look like somethin from the x-files
People want to see me die for then a little bit
But I'm a juggalo, and as a juggalo I want my shit
And I ain't gonna die till I get it!!!!

I want a rusty ax
I want to know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridget
I said faygo fuck mountain dew
Till I get my shit in this motha fucka
I will neva diiiiiiiiiieeeeee!

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood,
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood.
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine,
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my ax in my holster,
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster.
The sheriff at the border, he tried to take me out,
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his adams apple out!
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place,
He opened up his door, and shot me in the face.
It blew me off the porch, and blew my head in half,
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh. (Hehe!)
Ax in hand, I rose like the dead,
And swung with all my might,
I made a thump noise in his head.
Since we out west, I grabbed the shot gun,
And blew his fuckin' tongue out the back of his cranium!
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie.
There's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die.
I might use a gun, (No!)
I might use an ax, (yes!)
The carnivals in town, come and get your piggy snacks!
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick,
And this little piggy is a mutha fuckin' dick.
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a Volkswagon bug 17 deep
Packed full of juggalo's lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in pursuit, like Starsky and Hutch
But there's only 2 of them the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkin Doughnuts to gather up the rest
25 piggy's with a bullet proof vest
We lead 'em on a chase, they bustin' off rounds
but now they all fucked 'cause we at the carney grounds
And they gettin swallowed by their very own greed
Dark Carnival and Wicked Clownz 'cause we need
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothin like the squeal when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun, (NO!)
I might use an ax, (YES!)
The carnivals in town come and get your piggy snacks (2x)
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold,
He lives in a mansion on his own private road,
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait,
I snapped his fuckin' neck in 2 and slammed his nuts in the gate!
'cause this little piggy, must definitely die,
I'm a lob his nugget off and toss it in the sky.
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil,
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel.
People in my city, they fight for their meals,
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills.
A ritchie is the devil, he never will admit it,
So I'm a cut his hand off and slap his face with it.
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed,
I grabbed a brick of gold and smacked it upside his head.
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late,
And tied his neck in a knot and watched him suffocate, 'cause I need
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie

The dj tryna play me rude

I say ""what they call you?""
(i'm dj clay the baddeset dj alive today peep...)

I had to back up and scoop my wig off the floor
It practically blew out the door

I brushed myself off and walked back up to 'em
That's pretty good shit ya doing but (what?)

I'm thinkin I'm a little bit better (oh yeah?)
Some folks call me the neck shredder

'cause I cuts a lot too, so why don't you scoot down

And the thriving mob begins to tear at each other to find a place in lines that stretch out of view
And as attractions open wide to accommodate crowds frantically clawing their way inside
He will come to perform the cleansing 
As the seething masses turn to witness him growing near
Their eyes attempt to make out his face forming within the looming smoke
Suddenly, bang! Like a continuous explosion, he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury,
Enveloping the masses in darkness
Then, pow! A deep, resonating explosion of unparalleled intensity
Those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin, 
Which they soon realize is the blood of the shredded victims
They can only lay screaming in pure, stark terror, when boom!

Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant, horrific energy

Thought about the shower ha ha fuck that

I was awake but my dick was snoring
It was whistling and shooting out smoke
The head was spinning like a Dayton hundred spoke
I started shaking and sweating
I had a fever

It was greenish with purple bungions
And dripping blue skeet and flaking like onions

Then why does it suck so much to be Eric Ritter today? 
I'm like the captain of the football team 
And every girl who's someone in my school, they want to suck my dick or sleep with me 
I get big props, and high fives 
For them quarter back sneaks from the 30 yard line 
I never fuck with drugs, I only drink for the buzz 
I can handle my liquor, and my daddy is a judge 
And he looks out for me 
But what about the prom queen? 
It's been at least two weeks since she's been heard from or seen 
Susan Casada, her momma is a lawyer and her daddy is a doctor 
Her picture's in my locker 
Her body's in the lagoon, underneath the lily pads 
Glow from the moon, dark watery tomb 
Consumed the body, then pulled her below 
I wrapped her in my letterman coat and slit her throat 
Then I let go 
Loudest splash I ever heard 
And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word 

And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word

The marsh lagoon 
So many want to dump their dead in here 
Only the water 
Only the waters know what stories they bare 

My name's not important 
You never thought you'd see the day when you would see me again 
But now I caught you 
I've been abused, confused but uplifted 
So I choose to keep this inside but that shifted to a hate that'd keep me alive 
Until your heart stops 
Then padlock your time box and dropped it in a black marsh 
To hell and back is where my mind has been 
And once upon a time I had a friend I thought I really could confide in 
Flashbacks of the touching 
Uncomfortable feeling 
Can't sleep much at night 
I'm crawling the ceiling 
Got me feeling like I'm sick and depressed 
Cause everybody that I told, they just laid it to rest 
But now I'm twenty five 
And I'm sick of all the talking 
Now I'm stalking you, waiting by the door that you'll be walking through 
No disguise so you can recognize my face 
And all the shame and disgrace will be the reason I dismantle you 
I handle you like a candle 
Break you in half and then I laugh at you 
Soak you in gas and make you flammable 
I burned the body and I gathered the ash 
And then I sprinkle the lagoon every time I get the chance 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I got dark secrets 
Eventually I told everybody 
One day I'ma snap and leave a crime scene bloody 
But they only think I'm playing 
I'm just a Dave from Donut Hut 
They always like ""What up Dave Nut?"" when I show up 
But that doesn't really bother me I suppose 
Yet there's a darkness inside of me 
Which eagerly grows 
When I was younger I murdered off some neighborhood squirrels 
And this abandoned garage was like my own private world 
Now it's ""Honey, I had a bad dream again"" 
I'm tripping 
Demons eating me alive and burning within 
I gotta feed it 
I roll down another dark street 
I'm trying to find something alive so I can smother out it's heartbeat 
I'm thinking a hooker 
You think I'm bullshitting? 
I reach for my leathers, but I only find my wife's mittens in the glove box 
Circle some blocks 
I pick the chick up, I let her suck the dick up, before I cut her neck up 
She kicked for a minute, not putting much in it 
I never thought I'd get this mad 
I'm glad I did it, I admit it 
Feel so much better, a neck wetter, a throat shredder 
I got blood on my sweater and I better not get a head, of myself 
The first matter is disposal of the body 
I found the perfect spot out past my Uncle Marty's 
It's some hidden lagoon where it be dark all the time 
I dumped her there and got on with mine 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Only the trees

Insane Clown Posse,"What up y'all?
This Jed Thumpman
Let me tell y'all a little story
About a muthafucka that I know named Blaze
Now everytime we roll up a joint
Muthafuckas always be talkin' about Blaze Blaze Blaze
Man fuck Blaze
This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller
I don't give a fuck
Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner
Hustlin' on the grind
They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I want to do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope
The law ain't good for a muthafuckin thang
But eatin' mad donuts, and gettin' all in the way
I been gone for more than a day, and some things changed
Some many died and some faded away
I represent the ghetto from Harlem to Pinewood
I ride for the hood, I put it down for the hood

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

I've been dead to the world for the last 11 years
My body's decomposing, I'm missin' part of my ear
Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Psychopathic just like thugs
We ball, and we fight
And just like the freaks I come out every night
Holdin' down the sidewalk
Standin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk
Sippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE
Live from the DET we OG
Pissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'
Stay thug with the throw away in the trunk
Bitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper
Bitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter
Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie
G Blood imbedded in street blocks
That's why I put it down, and blast with many shots
Bullet holes in my chest, it's all good
Man I even died for my hood, muthafucka

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

How do I just turn the other cheek, when I'm disrespected, slapped and beat?

How can I pray true and true, when most of what I pray for don't come through,

They also messed up with,- paradisias fate.

We all felt the pain, we cried, and prayed to our distant gods.
We needed strength and power to fight back.
'cause the people from earth destroyed their own world,
They burned out their beautiful seas.
Now they're bringing to us,- mankinds disease.

We didn't stand up to fight these men.
We wanted peace and harmony.

Paradisia was our home,
It was our life, our world, our paradise.
And I know, that we can bring,
Our lives- back into light!

Our sirens are screaming so loud, we can't even hear our cries.
And maybe we won't live another day.
As time's passing by we cannot deny,
That paradisia's going to die.
So fighting for our world is the only way.

Now we will stand up to fight these men.
They wanted war- now it shall be!

Paradisia remains our home,
Will be our life, our world, our paradise.
And I know that we can bring,
Our lives- back into light!

That clansmen could set fire on the sky.
With hearts made of steel, the history can reveal,
That Scotland fought with courage and pride.

For the Scottish men to bring freedom to their land,
William Wallace was the one, a leader ""one of a kind"",

Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not a actor but the author
Of a modern day opera, where the main character
Is presidential paper, the dominant, factor
Babies cryin' brothers dyin' and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world",Cold World,1995
Inspectah Deck,"A-yo shorty, yo that's my word
Oh, y'all smelling y'all piss now y'all think y'all gold
Yo anybody get caught flinging
Over here, I'm returning 'em, that's my word they getting blasted
Anything from 220 to 140, that's mine
Y'all need to step the fuck off
Y'all niggas ain't crazy for real

Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

I'm deep down in the back streets, in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys,for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got vamped
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn
A kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block that played lookout
For playing predator with a Glock, he should have took out

No neighbourhood is rough enough
There is no clip that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates, and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organized his crime and drug wars

Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

There's no cuffs that's tight enough
There is no niggas that's fuck with us
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload

And if the women love it too well then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that
Bind-in, X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed military is necessary, it's a gamble
MC's bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the Duel of the Iron Mic
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, of massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin style is mad murderous

Well Cash Rules the spot

My preliminary attack keep cemetaries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MC's are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Them God struck, religious niggas call it bad luck
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now bees are stingin, yo that niggas em-singin
I'm just swingin swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MC's be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ the getaway driver
Tried to dip but he dive I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beat box
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father U C King the police

Inspectah Deck,"Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing

Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggaz for coming in my fuckin face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man
Poisonous

Poisonous paragraphs, smash ya phonograph
In half, it be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leavin mics with a cast
Causin ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulta
Rhymes runnin wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp I sliced the mic from the cord
First they criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is i, rebel ins
Ya highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of an eel, truth that I reveal'll
Crush the amateurs who screamed to keep it real
Caesar black down hoodied up and fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack, once I pull back
Then guard you, and bust through like a fullback

Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tappin inside my rap vein causes blizzards
Do I like the kills for ice trife like botta digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The earth spins ruins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggaz gaspin swallowin aspirins
What a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives my post-its hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole clan is on the run like natural born killers
Record-breaking the album thriller
Now access the jig who has bombs and rocket launchers
Float like dope killer bees is what I sponsor
Ya entrepreneur, pens and gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career is based on guns, throwin cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken and passed like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter ya feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Blew my family overseas in mansions
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats
Tax the kingpin of the rap drug traffickin
Village niggaz get slapped in manhattan
For rappin, big ghost steps off laffin

(Were you just using the wu-tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me)

Sit back relax, fake niggaz don't get turns
Watch me massage ya brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who is that? thousand dollar chains and techs
Focus, the brokest niggaz of life shit
These mics is like cocaine sun, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keepin up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off of
Puttin fifty on the land and allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matta of fact just adapt
Tie up, ya black nike's and tight hats
Corners, stay surrounded with foreigners
Whattup dread? feds caught you grudgin for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggaz with charges
Unify layin in the guard with la
My clan done ran from japan to Atlanta, with stamina
Clingers and gamblers, and gram handlers
Tical like the isle, so god, let's get steamed
Infrared guard yo' beem, so seek nuff respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it movin par shallah
Pro black like tar
Designin the fly shit and stay shinin and
The rza pours more beats than cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to black
With 50 other niggaz on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want some
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pullin out macs for fun

The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguin emcees, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggaz are timid, and nobody knows
How we move like wolfs in sheep clothes
Producin data, microchips or software
Undaground and off air, the land of the lost
Notorious henchman from the north
Strikin niggaz where the Mason-Dixon line crossed",Guillotine (Swordz),1995
Inspectah Deck,"It's assassination day

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line
I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter
From the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark
Pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered
My unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible
Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retreat through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God
His shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra
UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops know
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

It's assassination day",Assassination Day,1996

Wake you up and as I stare in your... (repeat 4X) 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember P, the one you got your whole style from? 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me, the one you got your rhyme style from? 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember P, the one you got your rhyme style from? .

Yo it's the P  

Yo, disperse from off this
Who the culprits

And the tech sales through the ceiling,
Let's talk with guns 

Convo til the po-lice come 
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match 
First max like it's Hamburger Hill for real 
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on, my outfit 

Stuck on some wild out shit, all about it 
We move gambit, through the overcrowded 
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips 
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc 

Me and the click-a, sit down and eat dinner 
Wake up every mornin' write a new banger 
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P 
Or the H-A-V-O-C, nigga

I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember Deck, I told y'all protect ya neck 

Fake one, take one, no ultimatum face one 
There's no escape from straight from the brain come the great one 
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head 
Slit your snake tongue, make one false maneuver you a mystery... 

Unsolved, the mob that we robbed's automatically involved 
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs 
Rock turtledove bowery suits and purple gloves 
Me and you can have some fun 

Make it a blast, you couldn't take the impact 
With steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood 
Veteran, covered in mud 
Wounded in the midst of war 
Still tradin' slugs gettin' major love 

Way above you newcomers, I come thunderin' 
With the heat of two summers when I enter the zone 
Move mountains with the presence alone 
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You private eyes home in 
But can't seem to clone 

[Chorus:]
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember Pun, the one you bit your whole shit from? 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember Pun, I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember Pun, the one with over a thousand guns 

Yo, Big Punisher's ready 
Prodigy, Deck and me, QB and Bronx trilogy 
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth
Swing on your world's piece 

Foil your plans, boil your grams, take a shine 
Fold all your hands, spoil your mans, make him mine 
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97 
Drop by your dwellin' got the weapon right behind your melon 

Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger 
I do it to live niggaz and Pulitzer Prize winners 
You wouldn't survive nigga, if I chose you 
Froze you from ear to ear, showin' your whole vocal 

Who told you
You could roll through
My lyrics practically rose you 
From the grave, like the Crow's do

Very ugly from the face up, leave you laced up

We stare you eye to eye 
We tell the truth no lie 
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die

High ranked officials and armed tanks with missiles, blood drizzle 
Simple fact, you slept on the issue, that B-boy started jerkin 
Joysticks a Sega, I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in ?, 2 fine tune it 
Ship enough units, emcees ask, who be those rhyme killers in mask 
No doubt, difficult task, the last in the square, beware 
Infinite amount of darts is in the air, I'm victorious 
With no opponents, I blast through components, with micro-phonics 
Watch the whole world live the moment, anything in time 
Became approaching this, are incompatible of speech, remains motionless

I self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings

Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher

Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect

The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Ain't no shittin when you gotta eat, we hold it down

Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand

High beams flash, promoters die behind CREAM 

Get your face blown, might face the chrome 

We take this more serious than just a poem 

[Havoc] 

I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent 

About the foul shit goin on in my life, current event 

It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville 

Thinkin to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill? 

Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase 

Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's 

So I chill, put my killa niggaz on the battlefield 

On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still 

never follow beef hey beef follow me 

want to settle in the court I say settle in the streets 

like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it 

Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it 

I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute 

Stash my dough secure the funds of profit 

[Prodigy] 

Yo, extreme rhyme niggaz, you wastin your time 

Fuckin with my niggaz, extraordinary line swishin 

your mind out position, tryin to figure this shit 

Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this 

Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song 

Doin this for too long, to not come strong 

You're only a pawn of Viet Dong 

Tryin to form against mines, you musta just been born 

Secluded on a distant farm 

This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked 

Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed 

Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch 

It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck.. 

Chorus One 

Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready 

for a war here, fuck peace, what?

But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic 
Extended clip rewind, bust mine,

Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds 
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze 
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede 
From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast 
Equipped to perform the task

The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust 

We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous

Extravagant, drop a helicopter high 
Up into the sky, lines philosophy

Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Firewinds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cop, hip hop to the limit

The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon ? tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust

Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut

Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
Wit turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over

In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy

Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch

Surrender your thrown, there's no room for pretenders
Bystander pollyin worldwide with nine members
Distributin, my verbal sharp shootin
While I execute the deadliest moves with fine tunin
Duel of the Iron Mic bound to spark fusion
Movin at the speed of light, nice at what I'm doin
Drop it in ya brain like spice, without the five mics
Heads roll off hilltops when I strike
Sniper aim, stick you up for your price of fame
Like the flame, watch you get hot inside the game

Strictly, Streetlife, I never play a fan of the fame
Just build on my name, and master the slang
I'm hittin harder than a lot of artists in the game

Than any MC who ship platinum or gold
And only recoup to pay back what you sold
Over budget your video, got pimped like a hoe
My niggas move slo-mo like robotic clones
I'd rather be alive and paid, than dead broke
My life is like a thin line, on a tight rope
A fiend with no dope, wrong way to provoke
The man behind the scope, tucked, ready to smoke
>From the same place you from, different hood, the same slum
Mother's third seed, father's first son

Throwin rocks at the ghetto birds circlin the urban
Workin overtime, you notice the shine
Niggas scope mine, models won't work Capone nine

Got money on my mind this year, by all means
Put an end to your cold stairs, crush your small dreams

I provide you with street music you can ride to
Push through, sound blastin through the sun roof

(Feel... baby.. sweet love.)

Ghetto princess told me she settled out in Flushin' Meadow
Fly chick rockin' size six Skiletos
Drapped-out in tailor made leather and suede
A serenade for the moment, then we part ways
What a child girl, quiet at home, huggin' the pilow and phone
Now you're grown, rollin' bones, holdin' your own
I admire, attire be bold just like her attitude
Jewels from head to toe, glowin' natural
I'm after you, your style's what I'm attracted to
Realize it and keep it movin' when you do pass through
Knowin' when we bump heads, we will soon bump hips
To be swimmin' in an ocean of love that sunk ships
Homin' with the tight grip, come thunderous
To wake up reminicisin' and spark the blunt clip
Have you lovin' it, wonderin' if I shall return
Forget me not, enternally the flame burns

[Inspectah Deck]
Last August, I met this hard chick, caught a carbon pick
'bout to visit her, man, in month six
Just comin' home from a two year trip
Now we 'bout to do two 'cause her man turned snitch
She under pressure, want me to come rescue her
but Inspectah is no haven for the rester
I feel you breakin' out but it's the path you chose
Fuckin' your foes will have sons breakin' your nose
I see her once or twice now as weeks went by
She'd slide by tryin' to hide the black eyes
Lookin' right though, I might go for her seduction
Dangerous curves, I must avoid bein' sucked in
Lustin', I caught her at the function
Slid out the side, saw the ride and jumped in
Later on, the fox unlatched the black box
Got her rocks then collapsed from the backshots

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
(Last night...) changed it all, I had a ball
First of all, I got an obscene phonecall
All I heard was heavy breathin', laugh sounds and moans
An intimate kiss followed by the dial tone
Repeatedly, this person kept callin' my home
Givin' graphic details of her sexual jones
No clue of who, must've been a total stranger
Annoyin' me, yeah, but talkin' me out my anger
State your name and stop playin' games
If you want to spark flames, it can be arranged
On your side of town, right around now
What you workin' with, let me know how it's goin' down
Then the phone clicked, then once again, it rang
with directions to the lab, where she's doin' her thang
To my surprise, when I arrived, she had her legs cocked
I got her red hot and blessed the wet spot

Check out the avenue  New York  New York the Rotten Apple 
We grapple in the streets to stack loot and slip the shackles 
I'm currently  servin twenty nine to life 
Duckin the searchlight  no sleep for like the third night 
The big life is trife  got the young kids hyped 
Cops shoot on sight  heat pipe be blowin through the night 
The land where you ain't fam  there's no pity 
Similar to Chocolate City, ten times gritty 
Hittin hard, liquor's God, niggaz plottin on the come off 
and come off, quicker than the clothes on the stripper 
and slide like she doin up and down the railing 
Bitch tailing in the Range with Golden Arms smooth sailin 
The clock's tickin, somebody's on the block snitchin 
The plot thickens, phones are tapped, cops listen 
Too hot for prison, plus too cold to hold my girl 
cause I married this life and she's my whole world 

Chorus: {unknown singer} 

It's just a sign of the times 
Calmly listen - to these lines.. 
I'm goin out of my mind 
Livin - the street life.. 

[Inspectah Deck] 
Aiyyo, aiyyo 
Make me want to holla way they do my life 
My life, is like a carousel one endless night 
Where most die for pies, some holdin their chrome 
A large percent die for causes not even their own 
When the Inspectah Deck be long dead and gone 
long live the I-N-S song they workin on 
Til then, I hold a section, I stand alone no co-defendant 
Showin the weapon, this saga had no story endin 
It's ghetto heaven, and at the same time hell - shots propel 
The one that missed me got Chanel 
In the future ruled by computer, I self tutor 
The music is the simulator, facin the user 
I do it for those who walk the same road 
And no regrets do I hold for the path I chose 
No sleep since the intro, patrol the windows 
I reminisce, with the chalice and my eyes half closed 
If I could do it again, I'd probably do it the same 
Thought I was through with the game, I'm goin through it again 
The hood life, I'm in it to the limit 
Couldn't quit it for a digit, die for it cause I live it 

Chorus 

[Inspectah Deck] 
Yo, been around the world but just can't seem to leave 
the state of mind that causes tangled web I weave 
Made my home in the heart of it 
Move like Seagal, ""Hard Target"" 
Most want no part of it, it's logic 
Cutthroat party in the Shark Pit 
Cold blooded souls carry bulldogs and oxes, knowledge this 
Maintain and remain sane 
In the cold world where the rules ain't changed 
Still Rebel to society, government be eyein me 
They probably watchin me right now as I'm speakin 
But all I'm guilty of is teachin you the truth 
They got proof, so you know I'll be home before the weekend 
The hood life, I'm in it to the limit 
In it from the scrimmage, livin it, lovin every minute 
and every hour, til the powers that be 
eventually stress me to the death

Smooth getaway, yeah
One time on my ass (getaway)
'Bout to make this hundred yard dash...
with the cash

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm fleein the crime scene on the major decon
Power steerin, lost the handle in the Jeep spin
Deep in the seat, high pursuit by the precinct
My co-defendant turned stake and let the beast in
They rush my old Earth lab, grabbed 50 g's cash
in the stash and let the glock splash
Sun dash down the fire escape past the weed gate
the weed gate, thought it was a sting, popped the tre' 8
Jakes givin chase, now the dread's my 'space
I was creepin down the staircase, we met face to face
In the lobby, cold stares, show no fear
We out for now, but next time we might go there
'cause po's here, must've turned down the walkie talkie
I thought I heard one tell the other that he caught me
Damn, they got my man, he knows shit
Bitch nigga that I rolled with told shit
I laid low, 007 'til I get dark
He told where my wiz lives and where the whip's parked
Got my address off the license plate
That eliminates, headin to my next restin place
Uncertain, my wiz peaked from behind the curtain
It seen the high beam from the chicky lurkin
The high speed chase, got my swervin
I needed a diversion, crashed in the side of a suburban
In the mirror, I'm starin at the eyes of the lord
Couldn't jump out, fucked up the driver side door
Called China, meet me in a half with the pathfinder
No time to talk, I'll fill you in when I find ya
Stopped at a neighborhood diner, brought me some attire
And swore to hold me down under fire (echo)

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
The word on the street, they can't trace my rap sheets
Still I creap swift, tryin to slip all heat
The word on the street, this thing's way beyond deep
Promise me you'll keep ya mouth close and don't leak
The word on the street, the evidence's concrete
My cold thief mysteriously got set free
The word on the street, the photograph
let the beast splash through the projects, the last you weap

[Inspectah Deck]
You bein watched like you new on the block from roof tops
Get your moves on these hot shots, pop, music stops
Party's over, bold soldier move for his holster
Shot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder
hard times for po-9, can't control the mass' sweep
for move backstage, we sling V.I.P. passes
Jakes sprayin mace, riots takin place
When the Clan show they face, the fans show they place
Get your blunt rolled, fuck the 5-0, they want it dun' know
Bitches get tripped over, niggaz wildin the front row
Fire marshall catch a beat down, tryin to cut my sound
Radio dispatcher, back-up, bustin rounds
without intermission from a crowd's position
Bullets ricochet off the strobe-lights, strikin Christians
My nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition
to bust back, fuck that, them out-of-town cats gon' take the rap
It's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4
Before we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door
Gats for the beast, high pursuit down the side streets
Shot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass
Flew the head rest off the passenger seat
I grabbed the heat, catched in the wif in and escaped on feet
While the locals interrogated for names and photos
work for 5-0, swappin info for dough

Hustlin' to be a man and feed my fam
My wife, my seed, my land, completes the plan
Please understand, either legal or scam
I see the thieves in the van, I can't beat the man
Still monster ballin', eatin', speakin' ebonics

Obey street laws, careful what you say
You can play, but you might not make it through the day

Foreigners talk funny, friends they want from me
But all I need is long money and a strong honey
I need it ""fast"", I'm ""furious"" like Vin Diesel
I'm lookin' at my plate wit food for ten people
So, do what you gotta do, do what you want to
The blocks hot like a sauna, cops try to pawn you
The fiends trick you, dude behind you want to get you
On the grind, your best friend'll talk for a figure
Walk wit a nigga, see it, don't talk about it, be it
Don't walk around, then beat it, we all bound to feel it

Then the spot was blown, cops rushed in, shots were blown

Undercover chased me down for three weeks
He ceased to interrogate like I might speak
But no, I won't tell ya who I work for
And no, I won't tell ya who the work's for
You can hit me with the book, brick, hammer and all
I dig a tunnel or just scale the jailhouse wall
Your honor..

[Chorus: unknown reggae artist]
True me ???
Dem a see me push weight and dem claim dem see me, dem try frame me
But me nah snitch, they try and test me me bust my clip
Me on de blunts all de time and de gyal dem a wine
True dem Rebel I and I, we bust down de sign
Try frame me but nah me nah snitch
They try test me me bust my clip

[Kool G. Rap]
They got me framed, locked and chained
'cause some lame on the block was slain
Cops came but I ain't pop a flame
Hear me ya honor? I ain't dropped a thing
I was cuffed, they told me that somebody dropped my name
And the time they tryin' to match me with is not the same
I was knocked from 8:00 to the time the shot went rang
When I woke up, I smoked up and watched the game
Then I laid up with my bitch and got rocked with brain
Release me from this Elymer Fudd shit, the glove don't fit
Too tall for the cop description and slugs don't fit
He was hit with a nine right? I bust slugs with a fifth
You got any of my D.N.A. or blood up in this bitch?
I'm not the guy aligned to fall, this not my crime at all
You lock me up, I'm climbin' the wall
You want me scapegoat, so stay close, alliance will call
With some grimy niggas schemin' on the shines in the hall
Fuck that, you and the D.A. spit-shine our balls
You can catch up with me some other time, from mines to yours

[Chorus]
[Killa Sin]
Come on a plea bargain for what, your honor?
Nah yo I ain't do shit, the only thing I'm coppin' is a new whip
The night it happened I was lampin' at a deuce flick with two chicks
Kim and Chris, we guzzle Cris' on some Rush Hour 2 shit
I knew the kid, yeah we had problems, yeah I robbed him
Now it's '98 though and the handgun was a revolver
You tryin' to play me on an old case but I hold no weight
Turned myself in, I skated on them keystone jakes
Right description, right Killa, wrong case, I didn't hit him
Here's the verdict, not guilty, not tryin' to see a prison
Got my life on the line, you want to grind me through ya system
And have my family and my wiz cryin', I miss 'em
You buggin', you the same judge that framed K with the drugs
Somebody came up dead and now you want to blame us?
This shit is too much, aiyo before you screw us
I'll grab the bailiff's gun and light this whole room up {*gunshot*}",Framed,2003

Get money, get fly, get busy, get live
Get over, get by, get women, get high
Get right!

[Inspectah Deck]
Think you can stop us, really? Ya'll niggaz got to feel me
Peel out Suzuki's, make those Kawasaki's pop a wheelie
'cause only I could hold me, V.S.O.P. control me
Better watch those rollies, yo, we crash spots, warn the police
You think you know me, cool as Coolie High, co-chief
Roamin' the streets, black like no justice and no peace
Keepin' the pace, not gon' lose my place, in this paper chase
Smell this pie we bake, make your plate, take a taste
Make no mistakes, though, some toes gettin' stepped on
My name is tephlon, hook 'em like it's methadone
Whenever the record's on, set the bomb, test my arm
I'm never alarmed, the best are harmed when the pressure's on
Back on the block, pull up on the spot, drunk's pop
Once a drop, echoin' through ghettoes like gun shots
Pull out that twenty spot, what we got's above hot
Killa Beez, we run shop, runnin' from the top, it goes

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Listen, baby, work your dance, to this verse I chant
Victim of my circumstance, get at me, first chance
Bet it's a short deal, good, how ya'll feel
Ditech, it's all wheel, gonna make 'em all kneel
Givin' the play, million shipped today, who got shit to say?
Poured it in Broadway, check me out in the big display
That's overlookin', Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn
Staten, Manhattan, wherever there's a hood in
I dig my foot in, men of honor like I'm Cuba Gooding
You was bookin' when they jumped off, but who was lookin'
Via satellite, I broadcast the fast light
That's right, pass the mic, load me up, I'll crash it tight
When in the zone, I lose it, I'll put them blown in fuses
There's no explainin', no escapin' and no excuses
Move if you true, the kid is due, let my niggaz through
Gettin' physical and the streets continue to

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, yeah
Ya'll, and that's right ya'll
And we goin' no where, it's all night ya'll
I love my ladies with jeans that fit tight ya'll
For all my fellas on bikes with chrome pipes, ya'll
Ya'll from the north, west, south to the east side
We really don't mind, we rep each side
Haters get mad, they left outside
You feel what I feel, then come inside

[Inspectah Deck]
The eyes like David Caress, so check my following
Move with The Movement, that's your only option
My coalition, all in position on this mission
No quittin', slowly inchin' closer to this vision
won't you listen, couldn't inflict your system with conviction
Stop your bitchin', hard times is all you're gettin'
See the fire in my eyes, desire in my vibes
Liar in disguise, never measure eye and eye
On any of us, what, bounce, before you get touched
The town's not big enough, give it up, get it shut
Down like Studio 54, you know that this be raw, you know that this be war
I'm ahead of the game, why lose, it's better to gain, no darts
Are ever the same, Deck's my name, I never changed
On the road to riches, out to foe the snitches
I roll wit chicks who pose for pictures, they rich and hold the figures

feat. DJ Kay Slay
[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Yeah, this that brand new Rebel I.N.S., back on the set
This shit is off the dial, Shaolin Style, better hold on to something

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, S.I.N.Y. and what
Hit 'em high, hit 'em low, head or gut
Yes, us, Lexus and next trucks
Flesh plush, land plus, extras
Cess, dust, whatever get you messed up
Test us, get crushed, next up
Better luck, we takin' off with jet thrust
Under pressure, they can't take the head rush
Talk to me, go and take the walk through me
Or yours truly, will screw you like a tour groupie
War duty, after I'mma call Suzy
Tall cutie, she'll do me like a porn movie
I burn thousand degrees, nothin' match me
You think you out of my league, now how can that be?
Son, you follow my lead, playin' the back seat
Ya'll ride dicks like a taxi, it's like that
Here we go..

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
I roll fat, holdin' a stash (it's like that)
Home girl, blowin' my jack (like that)
We boys in the mist of the noise (it's like that)
We big boys whippin' them toys (like that)
We up late, runnin' from jake (like that)
And still got money to make (it's like that)
From now until we finish the game (like that)
The world gonna cherish the name (it's like that)

[Inspectah Deck]
Downtown blowin' my sound, blew out your Alpines
Feel me, I did it for dough, this ain't about rhymes
Cash on delivery, not leavin' without mines
Face tried to powder my shine, it's about time
To politic, poppin' the clip, bust off the hot shit
Holler this, monstrous hit, and stop ya gossip
I rep, what you expect, I took a set back
Crept back, nursin' my wounds, lookin' for get back
Forced to bring the pain, make 'em say my name
Rings have changed, shinin' like I'm Ving Rhames
Or King James, hustlin', I sling game
Sting lames, this money makin' things change
I bless heads, push past the full macs
Left for dead, raised by the wolf packs
Black hoods, leathers with the wool hats
Draw blood, don't even pull gats, it's like that

[Interlude: DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyo, ya'll better kick your shoes off
And come on in!

[Chorus]

[Interlude: DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyo, this is all for my Metro card, one dollar cab niggaz
Niggaz who walk here, and all the ladies who stood on line in the rain
With the bouncers who let the thugs slide, come on, come on..

[Inspectah Deck]
The streets watch, ya'll gon get ya teeth knocked
The heats hot, bustin' til the beef stop
Preach not, our goal is to reach the top
Knees drop, I light it up and clean shop
Built with better design, clever mind
Verbal tech 9, light years, ahead of my time
And I, walk with, criminals who talk shit
We talk business, the blocks is our office
Many have come, few that could walk this
Roam too far, catch static like a cordless
I'm off this, pimpin' a broad, beyond gorgeous
Gettin' lost, dippin' in twin Porsches, it's like that

Ye-yeah
Smooth like a green Caddy, ya fiend badly
Heads spin like Giovanni's on the Navi
Hammers spit, quick as the darts, niggaz part
Like the Red Sea, test me, I'm sick with the art
Been held back, it's either rap or sell smack
Black Knight like Martin Lawrence run tell that
It's the I-N-S-P-E-see-T-A-H
Livin' life on the line, I hope I see daybreak
This is ground level, rounds echo out the Special
Be easy, U.D.'s out to get you
Throw it in a mash (so fast)
Known to spaz (so as)
We like strippers makin' niggaz (throw cash)
Smoke the blue green (call it Joe Cash)
Fake thugs (hold ass)
You be the next rapper (callin' Onas)
want to measure my size? I rise above the norm
The urban icon ridin' on the eye of the storm, fool

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
All my people from the front to back
If you want it like that just.. MOVE!
Get ill, no time to chill
Yo, you feel what I feel then.. MOVE!
Girlfriend, you love how it sounds
Put ya drink down and.. MOVE!
COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!

[Inspectah Deck]
What ya do now, put ya loot down
You can bet it on the new sound
Heavy like a Hummer on deuce pounds
True hounds, on the loose in ya town
Bound to the move the crowd, it's The Movement (you down?)
Scream at the top of ya lungs
Pop one for Aaliyah, Left Eye, BIG, 'Pac and Pun
Ride with my shotgun, rock with son
Heads bop to the drums, still shocked and stunned
Comin' live y'all, gangsta like white walls
On the blue Snoop Deville, watch ya eyeballs
Blade stay choppin' the track, game top of the pack
I spit flames y'all acknowledge the fact
Find out Big Rug get it poppin' like that
Throw it down like Stackhouse, cockin' it back
So ladies? Is you wit me now? Don't fake down
Everybody brace yaselves, it's a shakedown

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
I do this for dough, but it's really for love
Feel me, it's love for hot girls, willies and thugs
My groups cross seas, call us junglin' thugs
And it's sure to move ya feet like a gun in the club
I blaze like a ounce and a half, stay countin' the cash
For all lames that doubtin' my craft
He's no pretender, he won't surrender
(He's a rebel) Don't y'all remember?
A major player in the game
Play the frontline, ain't afraid to make a change
I stay way beyond range
So far from the norm my code name's Doc Strange
Now get down with the get down
Sendin' missles to all my dogs in the big house
Make 'em wig out, Spiderman still on the web
Log on like ya clickin' the mouse, yeah!

Yo, what's poppin' off out here son?
Yo, hold up, I think that's my baby mama on the phone
Damn, yo, hold on, yo hold on for a second
Yo, man, you see shorty right there (look at shorty right there)
Yo, I'mma call you back in a second, aight?

[Streetlife]
Yo, excuse me Miss Thang with your nose ring
The way your body swing, you make a nigga wanna sing
I can tell by the bling-bling, you like the finer things
And you highly motivated by what money brings
You got a dope fetish, attitude to go get it
A little athletic, no need for cosmetics
A little bowlegged, street smarts and good credit
You got the best part, that's why you actin' hard headed
It's a man's world, baby girl, don't forget it
But what's a thug without his ladybug, I must respect it
I know a woman's worth, ladies come first
I'm the Sun, you're the Earth, mother of the universe
I know what you like, you go for the street type
Who keep the g tight, and hit the G-spot right
I just might, call my wife
Tell her ""Baby, I'm not comin' home tonight""

[Chorus: Streetlife (Inspectah Deck) {both}]
Damn (yo look at shorty right there) nah, look at shorty right there

(Yo look at shorty right there) nah, look at shorty right there
(Look at shorty right there) damn
{In my life, my life}

[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, checkin' baby girl with the wavy curls
Precious lady pearl in the shady world
Please to meet you, your dress fit as if see through
Niggas treat you like royalty and dream to freak you
Diva in your own right, keep your home right
Bad bitch with the switch, let's trip the strobe lights
Tight with the Power-you, I'll devour you
Everything about you, make me scout you
No doubt, boo, make me fiend for a taste
Your hot like a fireplace, shows in your face
Now, come out the closet, baby girl, it's safe
Just a taste, of sex, lies and videotape
Let's skate, but late on the way, sound clever
Drinkin' brown leather, she down for whatever
We he call tomorrow, that's the question asked
Call it love at first sight, til the next one pass like

[Chorus]

[Streetlife]
Look at shorty right there, with the six-pack
Lookin' like a fruit snack with the shoe strapped to her knee caps

[Inspectah Deck]
Look at shorty right there in the blue Range
With the two bangs, high in the eye, she's a true dame

[Streetlife]
Nah, look at shorty right there, with the mini skirt
With pink finky shirt, the way her body jerk make my jimmy hurt

[Inspectah Deck]
Nah, shorty right there, the amazon
Six foot three, with the glasses on, built for a marathon

[Streetlife]
Look at shorty right there with the big hips (where?)
With the group of chicks, aiyo, lady who ya'll rollin' wit?

[Inspectah Deck]
Shorty right there, with the white dude
In the sky blue, knowin' she fly, friend is right too...
Look at shorty right there!

Inspectah Deck,"[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
2009!! Geez
Yeah, this be that old school type shit
Yeah, that Blaxploitation shit (Afro picks, Cadillac whips)
We gon' hit you like Truck Turner, with the burner

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm the Stereotype, in the zone where chrome meet chrome
Hard heads call it home sweet home
I rep that, hat to the back, chrome blaze
Low fade, blazin' the haze in the hallways
Young black nigga, bout to come back bigger
Rap action figure, that's strapped with the spitter
I serve mankind like a super hero
Gonna move the people, with sharp darts to the ear hole
And terror spin, veteran style, ghetto child
Call his name, hear it echo for miles
Check my fouls, before you get wild, reconcile
Trust, I touch kids, but I'm no pedophile
The Superfly, I, O'Neal, holdin' the steel
With the ounce from the greenhouse bent behind the wheel
What's the deal? Dick riders on board
In this Bloodsport, I'm like Jean Claude, yes, lord

[Chorus 2X: sampled singer (Inspectah Deck)]
This thing, is gonna be alright (alright) here comes the Stereotype
It takes, time to get it right (that's right) count on the Stereotype

[Inspectah Deck]
The Stereotype, this life, I'm knee deep in
The creeps keep creepin', the heat streets sweepin'
The greed keeps feedin', the seeds need teachin'
Police be seekin', all the ones free speechin'
Guns be blowin', young g's holdin'
Nerve control 'em, they say that son be zonin'
I'm half Huey, half Malcolm, part Martin
Mixed with Mark Garvey, sharp as Sharpton
A known fact, that I stay pro black
I go back like Kojak or Bobby Womack
Or maybe Jim Brown, been down from Ground Zero
Crowned reknown hero, sound pounds your earlobe
Mean daddy like a '69 green Caddy
Seen daddy soakin' that fox, she beam badly
With more drama than you find in the flicks
I'm Dolomite, without the afro picks or flyin' kicks, it's...

[Chorus 2X]

[Inspectah Deck]
My chain hang loose like I wear my jeans
I got soul like Rakim and Grandma Green's
I represent The Projects, everything hood
Big wolves in the woodwork, everything good
In the bright lights, Big City, it's ten times gritty
Doin' life on the streets, whose biddin' wit me?
Regardless, I'mma hold mine down, load my pound
Target on the unknowns who roam my town
There they go on that bullshit, when it go down
You know who the culprit, sure enough
The are-E-be	-E, L, yell it freely
I, call him Stereo, T-why-P-E
Greasy, on the hunt for the big easy
Switch the game like plantin' cracks on the D.T.
Say what you say, G, hate don't mistake me
Or play me like a must paid fee, that ain't me

Yeah, back from the dead
It's the Rebel, I Soldier, I told ya
I shall return, yeah

Ya'll done fucked up, lettin' me live, something's got to give
I'm positive, you're gonna all pay homage
Believe me, I ain't lyin' down that easy
And that thought applies for those who proud to see me
Through the distraction, I was wounded in action
An act of betrayal, but I knew the assassin
Now I pack a vengeance like Steven Seagal
I'm back from the trenches to even the odds and...

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
You hear the rockets red glare? The bombs burstin' in air?
Gave proof through the night, that I stood through the fight
Yeah, the Rebel's still here, what?

Ya'll better rock ya'll hoodies
And hold your girl tight, before we pop that pussy
It be so real, I don't need no deal
My mass appeal make a marvel out how he so ill
Ya'll time is up, try your luck, ya'll wind up
Fucked up, before you even recognize I struck
Roll with the live dozen, got all eyes buzzin'
With strong rhymes cousin, been a long time comin'
Break your weak links, in the chain, fuck your mink, and your reign
Son is lame, plus he thinks it's a game
But, we about to apply the heat (the heat)
And snatch him up out the driver's seat
I put my life on it, post up like who want it
Blast off with the force to send ya'll in orbit
Wild like whitey's in the mosh pit, yeah we gon' start shit
Pack 'em down, then corner the market

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
To all my real M.C.'s, the ones without a deal M.C.'s
The ones who kick the real life music
Let's link, them niggas can't move no more units

[Inspectah Deck]
For life I'll be underground, their first thought
Was yo, ""How did he survive with no commercial support?""
Damn right, I miss the corporate politics and tricks
Where the SoundScan is rigged and contracts are fixed
I sit in the pit where the grime exist
Legendary, they still lovin' my rhymes from 9-6
Now I'm back, that's my word as I reveal this shit
By choice or by force, ya'll gonna feel this shit, ya hear?

Yeah, what, it's a Shaolin thing y'all, get familiar


[Inspectah Deck]

Truth scholar, you holla up the few dollars

I work it overtime, whether white or blue collar

I prove my honor, 'cause I been through the drama

Wu-Chronicles, and I continue the saga


Chart topper, rhyme tough as body armor
When I speak, I hold the globe like a Dhali Llama

The flow is aqua, pa, you swimmin' wit the known piranha

The soul father, get to know my whole persona
Like Shaquana, from Guyana, stay lace in cabana


Fiend for the block opera, your top sponsor
For papa, she shake her tata's like maracas

Got you locked in the scope of the rocket launcher


Stop your offers, cop mine, I drop it monster

Let the rhyme inside your mind like chocolate ganja, it's the worst



[Chorus: sampled singer (Inspectah Deck)]

He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)

He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs, he..

I supply the fire, let your headsets be the bomb

One song, give you pipe dreams like Cheech & Chong

Got dough, cop and go, all else breeze along

Be strong, the high last four weeks long

Get your eat on, she'll hold you til the fever is gone

Got you cold sweatin', and up creepin' til dawn
Wide eyed, off the side, no sleepin' on morn'

O.D.'ing, just the side effects, so, please be warned


Son, I raise your blood pressure like tight jeans and thongs

Guaranteed like throwin' the bomb to Keyshawn

Put your peeps on, I spice it up like Dijon

We be, ease to calm, to the streets we belong

Don't be alarmed, 'cause indeed the heat is on

So hot, to touch me, you need tweezers and tongs


If I breathe on the mic, it's left weakened and torn
Til he gone, you'll be leanin' like your sneakers are worn, off the worst



[Chorus]



[Inspectah Deck]

I got the works, like a Burger deluxe, you heard it was us

Got You All in Check like Dirty and Bust'

Play dirty and rough, remain thirsty for bucks

Seein' dollar signs like today's the first of the month

Dunn, it hurts when I touch, flames burst off the verses I bust

Some wanna scuff, but ain't worthy enough


What? I burn you up rookie, just hang your jersey up
I'm on the east side, workin' at a Mercury truck

Seen me servin' up the uncut, that certainly crush

Murderous, first to bust, expert in the clutch

That's my word up, loose links, lurk in the cut

On the re-up, be sure to catch a third degree rush

Here's your beat up, I keep the cut, verbally plush

Keep a burnin' Dutch, heat tucked and burgundy chucks


Won't you turn it up, them wit the girlies, they lust

It's the dopeman, my jams run your thirty and up, it's the worst

Never talk to a teacher in school
You might think that this environment's cruel
Fuck it, this what I decided to do
Started stealing anything I could move
Now I'm thirteen, with something to prove
Buddha hit me with a twenty-two
That started my career with a tool
Nothing to it, get up on 'em, tell 'em ""pass it all""
Since you short, if you move, blast it off
Like a rocket, if he falls, dig his pockets and run
And if you get caught, just rep where you from, little nigga
I know what's it like out there, you strugglin' and you grinding, let's go

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Thug paradise, drugs, gats and knives, life sacrifice
Nickel dime grind, catch a full clip, half price
Kings tumble in time, it's like a jungle sometimes
I play it humble, gotta rumble sometimes
Big timers taking numbers with nines, with the bundles of dimes
You wind up, with a gun to your spine
And the coppers never solve the case
Them gorillas in the mist, war, and get lost they hard to trace
Man this cold world'll scar ya fate, so I stay awake
Late night with cigars, and jars of haze
Half my comrades dead or in jail, most said I would fail
I'm still alive, getting checks in the mail
Still cowards wanna force my hand, eating off my hand
Boiling water, never lost a gram
Cash Rules, I'm pulling off the scam, catch the bossman
Sure hand, on the dice, in the game of life, life

[Chorus]

[Hook: Chico DeBarge]
You don't know... what it cost to pay that ride
You don't know... what you lost til it pass you by
You don't know baby, that you could, til time is fading you by
And you don't miss, all that's in your way, til you circle or try

Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe

The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You want to bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'

Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street niggaz is dyin for

Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13

Check my Dogs at the Reservoir
Gourmet special of the day is n*gga Souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggaz in the P.J.
To Klingon, bring on, the Good Times for Keyon
Hood rhymes that's be-yond ya thinkin
For eons, I've been hear to shine on the black minds

Well groomed, dance hall
Packed, full bloom

Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon

Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you

Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

Point blank as I kick the square biz

Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style

Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin

Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap

 Look at mama baby boy actin like he grown
 No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
 Killa bee, that be holdin down his honeycomb, loungin son
 Wu brother number one, protect your neck
 Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
 Hard times and killer tactics, spittin words plus
 semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
 novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
 shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
 To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
 Hand on my nutsac, and spittin lung-ghies
 At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
 When it come to RZA tra-cks I don't know how to act
 Real rap from the Stat, killa hill projects
 How to be exact, break it down
 All and together now
 Things are getting good looking better now

Inspectah Deck,"After laughter, comes tears

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

After laughter, comes tears

Inspectah Deck,"What y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
I'm the Osirus of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God

No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds

Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers

On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check

Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods
Drops jewels, from a street corner level, young brother, I'm a rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Ya'll rap cats had your last win, toast the kings

The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece
Moving through them housing with more ki's
Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles
Niggaz want the problems, we back
It's time to take over the game, it's nothing
I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules
Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war
I do this all the time, all the time, all the time
Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby
Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving
Fast pace of a CREAM chasing team
Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens
Let them other niggaz wear that, we take the credit
While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites
Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors
Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors
Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming
I'll be on the line with my iron
Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas
Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pijamas
You live like a slouch from vouchers
Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers
Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing
Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone

The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots
The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop
The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand
Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand
Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes
Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life
Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared wiyh lead
Gamble with off track betting instead
In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it
Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office
And the thought is to be boss of all bosses
The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas
So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up
It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just'
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing
It's sick in the slums and niggaz are stunting for nathin'

Ayo, my gun been in more niggaz mouths than a whore had dick
With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw
It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports
Riding on niggaz like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende?
Yeah, I'm kinda off cuz my guns was dirty
That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty
Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance
More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence
Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word)
Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire
It's them disco kids that clap iron
Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying
We crack eightballs with pool sticks
Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks
Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks

In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra

This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you give the jewelry up

And what is your answer base
Be careful cause everything can change
Head up
Matter of seconds all off
Your recollections might
Become all that you've got left

It feels like fear
Like someone slapped me in the face
And then punched me in the stomach
My security erased
Its like alone with one subtle impulse
Has no subject
No object
Just a rest without a pulse
And I want to do it all again

Dumbstruck and disenchanted
I won't take anything for granted
That was the worst mistake I made, I made
Harmless remarks
For example these
Wet behind the ears and weak behind the knees
Well they all never seem that harsh
A simple call for concern
But now it hurts so much
Its the hardest way to learn,
Its the hardest way to learn

Promise
Whatever happened to you
Take care
Ambition and put it all into his mouth
No
There's some days I can't get out of bed
Cause I'm reminded what it's like to doubt you

Whenever another second passes
And I'm expected to be some merry god of strength
But lets hope I make it through this week

I'm In the backseat of this car.
My belt is buckled, locked and clasped.
And I'm not sure how long this ride will last.
I've seen so much. And I've had dreams
But I can't tell you what they mean
And I've been far. Too far to see.
And where I've been is part of me
And if my life goes flashing by
Like they all say I hope that I
See my entire family.
It's so much bigger than you'd ever thought it to be.
And I've heard songs and harmonies.
I've kept them here inside of me.
And I've had friends-The best indeed.

And I only want to stay

'Cause at the times that I'm feeling down
And left out in the rain
My heart is filled with you.

If I'm lost in time- I'm by your side
No longer wandering- I've found my home forever.",Immortal Beloved,2001
Inspection 12,"Been stricken sick. She could be the cure
And I felt quite sure. I opened every door.
It makes me sick; the things I do for you.
The shit that I go through, but I can't make you secure.
For once make it go away.
Give me what I want and I'll be fine.
I need some attention. You can help me clean my wounds.
Gotta lot of sewing up to do.
And I know what it's like when they're twisting your arm.
And it's difficult I'm sure when you don't know who you are.
But they don't own you though they may seem to.
But isn't that what it means when you belong?
Isn't that what you wanted all along?
Hadn't you realized you might be wrong?

Everyday I look in the mirror and I'm never quite the same.
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But words will never hurt me, I'm told.
Well, I'm not so sure I believe all that hype.
I suffer from things that I hear all the time
To tell you a little bit about me.
I'm clearly a fool full of uncertainty.
But I've no intentions of closing my eyes or my ears.
I'll work my way through overcoming my fears.
Time moves on and I do too.
Why waste my time wondering what else there's to do?
Expecting the worst is the best thing I've found.
Good intentions are paving the way.
Don't you remember back in second grade;
All of the attempts they made?
They taught us of the golden rule.
""Please take it with you after school."" They told us.

It's finally started to make sense to me.

I'll be fine.

Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fuckin' projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were dere
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops
For his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashin' checks again
Back to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington

Babies cryin' brothers dyin' and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

Yo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Clicks control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin' fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
'Cause niggas main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not a actor but the author
Of a modern day opera, where the main character
Is presidential paper, the dominant, factor

Herbal vapors, and biblical papers

Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin

Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin for a serum, to cure em

Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut

Sorry but I had to fold her, like a pornography poster she showed her

My music keeping me sane
They say it’s levels to the shit
I say it’s levels to your brain
You can’t acquire the higher
You’ll always remain the same
Regardless of all the money
And bitches yanking your chain
What good is a private plane to a man who can’t walk the plains
Hip-hop is now gen-pop, populated with lames
Attacking you with these frequencies
Meant to destroy your brain
I’m fitting to go supernova
Expose em to superflames
Soon as I pick these locks on these psychological chains
The answer is in the question
The question comes from the pain
And the pain is just electrical signals sent to my brain
But the brain is just a box where information remains
As I try to remain a soldier, the voice in my head explains

I’m still shadowboxing lungs and oxygen
This an icebreaker, no bubblegum was popping
Another hot concoction trick, ya might need amoxicillin
The kid’s too sick, You're gonna need shots to kill em
My method is ill, Doc admit him
When I see you, ICU can get em
Your boy give em bars until the judge acquit him
The court can’t convict him or find the gloves to fit him
That’s OJ, I mean OK, I mean, I’m not kidding, no play
Jealous ones still envy, That’s Jose
Peace to Cartagena, I flow hey
But I don’t speak Spanish, yo no se
I’m a seasoned veteran, obey
Obtain a freestyle, it’s cold pay
The old me, resort to my old ways
My old man was stuck in his old days
Still he wanna blaze like John but rapping ain’t in his forte

Look how we did it to ya
Y’all just don’t get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
Im’a get it to ya x4

My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
Im’a get it to ya x4

It was only the elite who could walk these streets
With jewels and not get stuck
Niggas didn’t give a fuck
Real G’s know I’m talking about
Taking what you making, stripping what you wearing
Caring about nothing
Gun barrel in your face, cold steel on your cheek
This is how we meet and greet
Enemy across the street
Leaning on his Rover jeeps
Smiling, showing all teeth
Seeing son in my hood, it ain’t all sweet
And you haven’t earned the respect
Of those who come, creep and take money
So you just food that niggas come eat
And they don’t get no chain back
You might see em rocking that
Fuck you looking at? Problem needs solving
You see that big 357 thing revolving…revolving

Yeah, you niggas ain’t street
My money talks word of mouth
I figured you out
The life I live, you’re not about
Price on your head, I’m taking cash advances
I’ll take my chances, then deal with the circumstances
Livin’ off the land like a land shark
I’m on the lamb like the gyro with the white sauce
Idle times a devil
Playground, make moves
Watch me kill your whole vibes, crush groove
Hands high, say hello to my little friend
Point the finger at the bad guy, it’s me again
Who are they to criticize me?
I do it like a G
I’m a nigga from the mutha-fucking streets
Throw me in the fire, watch me bubble
I was built for the struggle, my knees never buckle

Look how we did it to ya
Y’all just don’t get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
Im’a get it to ya x4

Forcing conscious to conscious every small attack

Confrontation complication needs a foundation
I'm calm baby, I'm calm

So sour?

La tierra lo está esperando
Con su corazón abierto
Por eso és que el angelito
Parece que está despierto

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su centro
En el brillo de una rosa
O de un pececito nuevo

En su cunita de tierra
Lo arrullará una campana
Mientras la lluvia le limpia
Su carita en la mañana

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su diana
En el misterio del mundo
Que le ha abierto su ventana

Las mariposas alegres
De ver el bello angelito
Alrededor de su cuna
Le caminan despacito

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma va derechito
A saludar a la luna
Y de paso al lucerito

Adónde se fué su gracia
Adónde se fué su dulzura
Por qué se cae su cuerpo
Como una fruta madura

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca en la altura
La explicación de su vida
Cortada con tal premura
La explicación de su muerte
Prisionera en una tumba
Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma se queda oscura",Rin del Angelito,1990
Inti-Illimani,"Desde el hondo crisol de la patria
Se levanta el clamor popular,
Ya se anuncia la nueva alborada,
Todo Chile comienza a cantar.

Recordando al soldado valiente
Cuyo ejemplo lo hiciera inmortal,
Enfrentemos primero a la muerte,
Traicionar a la patria jamas.

Venceremos, venceremos,
Mil cadenas habra que romper,
Venceremos, venceremos,
La miseria (al fascismo) sabremos vencer.

Inti-Illimani,"De nuevo quieren manchar
mi tierra con sangre obrera
los que hablan de libertad
y tienen las manos negras.
Los que quieren dividir
a la madre de sus hijos
y quieren reconstruir
la cruz que arrastrara Cristo.
Quieren ocultar la infamia
que legaron desde siglos,
pero el color de asesinos
no borraran de su cara.
Ya fueron miles y miles
los que entregaron su sangre
y en caudales generosos
multiplicaron los panes.
Ahora quiero vivir
junto a mi hijo y mi hermano
la primavera que todos
vamos construyendo a diario.
No me asusta la amenaza,
patrones de la miseria,
la estrella de la esperanza
continuará siendo nuestra.
Vientos del pueblo me llaman,
vientos del pueblo me llevan,
me esparcen el corazón

No canto ni por encargo
Ni por tener buena voz

Cantó porque la amistad
Cantó por la realidad
Cantó por el sufrimiento
Cantó porque su talento
En la música desgarra
Cantó porque las amarras
Se soltarán de la gente
Se le oyó decir ausente
Cantó porque la guitarra

Tu vida encaminada
Por un ideal diferente
Por estar entre la gente
A la muerte llevada

De la fuerza y la opresión

Que fuiste traidora, enfame, e enfiel
Que tan fuerte sera este reproche
Que ni el mismo fuego ha podido cojer

Ayer prendi fuego a la casa
Why al ver tu retrato quemarse
Me puse a llorar

Oye que mi pobre guitarra
Entre llamas lloraba
Alli se quedo entre las llamas
Perdido en cenisas
Su llanto de metal

Solo ha quedado el reproche
Que fuiste traidora, enfame, e enfiel
Que tan fuerte sera este reproche
Que ni el mismo fuego ha podido cojer

De lo que fuimos los dos. el dolor se termino
Y cada baldosa que yo piso al alejarme 
Me renueva la ilusión de ser libre de tu amor 
Y tu perdón

Laberinto con tu alma en cada calle siempre esta 
Y aunque busque una salida esta causa esta perdida 
Y se cerro
No. puedo creer que el sol no nos ayudo 
Solos nos dejo
Cobarde si me quedo, cobarde si me quedo, cobarde si me voy

Fueron esos años la felicidad sincera pero un día termino 
El fracaso como un tajo nos marco
Y esa herida eterna que llevamos en la cara 
Es la marca del amor, una carga que me llevo si me voy

J´ai les mêmes cheveux que Dalida
La barbe de Fidel Castro
Et un gros berreta!
La guimbardine de Columbo,
Les lunettes d´Elton John,
Et la dégaine distinguées des frères Dalton.
Les lieux sont repérés, 9h devant la banque,
J´suis devant le sas,je sonne et je rentre,
Je fais la queue comme tout le monde,
Mes potes m´attendent 2 rues plus loin,
Je suis opérationnelle dans 30 secondes.
Je guette le vigile, et vue qu´il me regarde bizard,
Je m´approche vers lui et je lui dit ""Qu'est-ce que t´as connard?""
Je lui met un coup de plafond et de suite je sors
Mon arme et je braque la grosse,
Vue qu´elle se trouve derrière le comptoir,
""Ferme t´as gueule on va pas en fire tout une histoire.""
D´ailleurs, hey ouvre le sas (ouvre le sas!)
Y a mes potes sur le trottoir,
Je sors les sacs de sports en un temps record,
Met juste l´oseille et dans 5 minutes je sors

On fait notre entrée dans la banque sans faire TOC,

On est entré dans tes pensés, remarque l´entrée des artistes.
Artistes cagoulés, je donne l´ordre que tout le monde se mette à terre,
Je tire une fois en l´air,
C´est bon on à le feu vert!
Bonjour m´sieur directeur,
On vient relever les compteurs,
On va pas passer une heure à attendre les inspecteurs.
Assez parlé et passons aux choses sérieuse,
J´ai pas le temps de m´attarder, chaque secondes me sont précieuses!
Pendant qu´on est dans les temps, je m´occupe de l´argent de surface,
Du travail de pro, t´inquiète on laissera pas de trace,
Je remplis les sac à bloc, et là, la pourriture veille,
Si ça tourne au drame on va laisser des cervelles.
Direction la salles des coffres, j´emmène le directeur au sous-sol,
Mais là y a un petit problème, ce bâtard ne veux pas cracher le code,
Obligé de séquestré,y a refus d´obtempéré,
Il a fallu que je lui fasse montré des photos de sa femmes ligotée!
Je prend en otage 1 client qui a voulu faire le justicier
Canon sur la tempe on fais plus ça sinon je vais te tuer
Ça risquerais de finir en boucherie
Y a plus de temps a perdre on se dirige vers la sortie.
On monte les escaliers les sacs chargé
On peut y aller je crois que les gars on a touché un gros paquet de billets.
J´allais oublié je prend le directeur pour couvrir la fuite
Ce on vas le lâché sur le périf
Ok on se barre (on se barre) dans les sacs plus de 100 barres
Je préviens le D, le M qui sont resté a l´écart
A la sortie de la banque
On se précipite à la planque,
Le D prêt à partir avant qu´il y ai une descente.
Y a rien qui manque?
Non! Le D est là?! Ouais!
Le M est là? Ouais!
La pourriture! Ouais!
Le colonel? Ouais ouais vas y on se barre,
Vas y tous dans la voiture.

Une sortie plutôt fracassante,
Mes membres en attente
Dans l´attente d´une couille imminente,
Je garde le contact et mon one (et mon one)
Plus que 10 secondes,
Putain ça me laisse juste assez de temps pour finir ma blonde

Drive au volant je vous conseille de vous accrocher,
Frain à main, tête à queue, trace avec mes complices,
DR6, 1, 2, 3, 4 j´aime la police.
Je reprends le volant, sans avoir fait le contrôle technique,

Avec Démon, D.R.Y, dissipés, défoncés
Peux mieux faire, peux mieux faire
Ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros

Pour toi c'est difficile, tu rappes c'est inutile
Ca sent le bas résille, on aime pas trop ton style

Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire, qu'est-ce que tu peux faire, frère?
Intouchable et Booba, y a rien à faire, y a rien à faire, frère
Comment t'exprimer ce qu'on ressent, quand t'es jeune tu dors dehors
Squattes les caves la où ça pue, ça sent le symptôme d'une vie hardcore
Quand t'as faim, pas un joint, aux yeux des gens t'es rien
T'as rien, pour rien tu pourrais tuer en fait tu deviens comme tous ces gens
Que gamin tu méprisais, en combattant des enculés
Tu peux devenir sans t'en rendre compte toi-même le pire des enculés
Ma vie, un film d'horreur, de drame, de guerre, de bals
Mon corps s'emballe, au cœur j'ai mal, trop de potes à moi sont tombés sous les balles
Au final j'en porte les marques mais dans les unes des autres se démarquent
Du ghetto j'en ai sa marque, ses halls, son dépôt et la BAC
Le béton gris m'a endurci, gros m'a rendu plus féroce
Élevé au sky, au spliffs, dans ma tess j'ai vu des scènes atroces
Faut pas grand chose, juste un mot, un regard, tu peux t'en prendre une
Dans le contrat y a aucune clause qui dit qu'on fume pas pour des thunes
Le jour où je partirais, une part du ghetto s'en ira

Intoxicados,"Nunca quise a nadie tanto como a vos
Por eso es que empiezo a dudar
Si seremos hermanos que nos separaron
Y nosotros sin saberlo nos volvimos a juntar
Tu sangre es roja, la mía también 
Creo no me equivoco, algo tendremos que ver
Somos indios latinos con guitarra eléctrica
Y comunicados a través de internet

Para odiar hay que querer
Para destruir hay que hacer
Y estoy orgulloso de quererte romper
La cabeza contra la pared, sí

Y por todas esas cosas que tenemos en común
Hace tiempo ya marchaste de acá
Te cansaste de mí, yo me cansé de vos
Pero cuando nos miramos sabemos que no es verdad
Porque tanto te quise y tanto te quiero
Siempre una marca tuya llevará mi corazón
Disculpa si te parece raro
Pero comparto la opinión que escuché en una canción
Let it be!
""Si la amas déjala ser, si la quieres déjala volar""
Nunca fui tu patrón, no quisiera cambiarte
Y no quiero que pierdas tu personalidad

Para odiar hay que querer
Para destruir hay que hacer
Y estoy orgulloso de quererte romper
La cabeza contra la pared, sí

Para odiar hay que querer
Para destruir hay que hacer
Y estoy orgulloso de quererte romper
La cabeza contra la pared, sí

Para dejar hay que beber
Para morir primero hay que nacer
Siento ganas nuevamente de tirarme a tus pies
Y llevarte a mi morada otra vez

Y si esperás vas a entender

I figured it out when I caught that hickey

Between yo' legs with yo' chocolate slippy
Now Bob busy, gotta taught you like Frisbee
Out the window, off and away you go
Ain't got no time and no love for hoes, fuck

How many project sluts wanna nut or get touched?
And ramped up in the back of my truck
Or to eat the Benz up when yo' girlfriend would
Have her knees to her ears so I can slip in good

Bobby now walk the block with black hoody hat
Dog on the prowl upon to snatch the little putty cat
Red Red Riding Hood and I'm the Big Woof
'Bout to puff off these pistols like I'm George Bush

And push, push through your power you
Goosh, goosh explode my load
Have it running down your toosh, toosh
Now you speaking the round like a crook, crook
Trying to look inside my phone book, book

Oh, you take me for a fool, I shit my sister for you
Claim on sneaking, sleeping, creeping, cheating, you bugging, yo
Listening to yo' cousin now because she a lonely hoe

Siffle fickle minded dizzy trying to insult I
Now you wanna go and turn around and to ask why
Peace be out bounce, spread yo' wings fly
Me loud, c'mon, how? That ain't God's style

c'mon man, you don't know me by now?
Three years in, I should've messed around but somehow
I kept it real, girl, I was ya nigga until
Ya switched the whole current and if that's how you feel

Inure,"I feel sick and I try to disguise
This pattern often lies
In mind I cannot pry 
To slip inside denied yet penetrates the eye
No simple reason why
Still something will collide
Shake as I touch to find
These thoughts ennui will bind
In short there is no time

Staring From the walls within
This disease surely could 
Not face the fear that seals more of
My heart sometimes than should

I feel sick and I cannot hide
This torment from my eyes 
And fear will never see it's here inside of me
As much as I believe 
And try to rearrange
But would it ever change
Or just remain the same 
A test or what I will
Know that I want it sill

Staring From the walls within
This disease surely could 
Not face the fear that seals more of
My heart sometimes than should",Sick,2006

Invertigo,"When I reach out, you move away from my hands
You're never telling me why
We make time to spend
Time you forget and the days are just passing us by

When I ask you, you never understand it
You don't know what you haven't done
And when I try to explain, it sounds like complaint
And the words only make you more numb

Is there a fire you don't see the smoke?
We can't get higher if you don't let it go

How did your heart ever get like that?
How did someone ever hurt so bad?
That you can't see it
You've been kicked inside
You're desensitized
How did you heart ever get so cold
How did someone ever get so close
They you just don't know
How if feels inside
You're desensitized

I want to believe that it's a phase you go through
That only gets harder to tell
And sometimes I think, it's an easier thing to believe
That there's someone else

Is there a fire you don't see the smoke?
We can't get higher if you don't let it go

Invisible,"Temprano el durazno, 
Del árbol cayó 
Su piel era rosa, 
Dorado del sol 
Y al verse en la suerte, 
De todo frutal 
A orillas de un río, 
Su fe lo hizo llegar 

Dicen que en este valle, 
Los duraznos son de los duendes 

Pasó cierto tiempo, 
En el mismo lugar, 
Hasta que un buen día, 
Se puso a escuchar, 
Una melodía muy triste del Sur 
Que así le lloraba, 
Desde su interior 

Quien canta es tu carozo, 
Pues tu cuerpo al fin, 
Tiene un alma 

Y si tu ser estalla, 
Será un corazón, 
El que sangre 

Y la canción que escuchas, 
Tu cuerpo abrirá, 
Con el alba

La brisa de Enero, 
A la orilla llegó, 
La noche del tiempo, 
Sus horas cumplió 
Y al llegar el alba, 
El carozo cantó, 
Partiendo al durazno, 
Que al río cayó 

Y el durazno partido, 
Ya sangrando está, 
Bajo el agua",Durazno Sangrando,2004
