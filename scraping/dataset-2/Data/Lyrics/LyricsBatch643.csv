B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself",Express Yourself,1990
Madonna,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat 
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Hoo, like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine 
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Like a virgin, ooh ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me 

Oh oh, ooh whoa",Like a Virgin,1990
Madonna,"It's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away

Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good by myself",Oh Father,1990
Madonna,"I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

With you I'm not a little girl
With you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me
Comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious
You see that I am weak
You see that I am silly
And pretentious and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope

With you I'm not a fascist
Can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate
You're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry
For a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart
When she's demanding
You bring me to my knees
While I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer
And deliver and despise
And right while I am standing there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe
Life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Stop me from drowning
Baby I'll do the rest

Rescue me (rescue me)
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me (rescue me) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope

Rescue me (rescue me)
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me (rescue me) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope (baby throw out the rope)

Ooh aah, ooh aah, love is understanding
Ooh aah, ooh, aah love is understanding

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe
Life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Rescue me, rescue me

It's not my business to decide
How good you are for me
How valuable you are
And what the world can see
Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage
To love me for me

I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe (I believe that you can rescue me)

I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe (I believe that you can rescue me)

I'm saying I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe (I believe that you can rescue me)

I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, I believe that you can rescue me
I'm talking, I'm talking, I believe in the power of love
I'm talking, I'm talking, I believe in the power of love

I'm singing, I'm singing I believe that you can rescue me
Hey hey hey, R-E-S-C-U-E  M-E, only you can rescue me
Hey hey hey, I believe you can rescue me
I believe in the power, I believe you can rescue me",Rescue Me,1990

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time

I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby
This I know 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love was all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said

True love

I'm the brother with the short short dreads

He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself

Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
It's in my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden",Secret Garden,1992

Madonna,"Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can

Madonna,"I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about

I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you
In case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
""Finger lickin' good""
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood
Are you still hungry
Aren't you glad you came
I'm glad you brought your rain coat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is
That's where my love is
Come inside, that's where all life begins

Cut into my life

You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Madonna,"Made your acquaintance late one night
You were floating around, you know you gave me quite a fright
You didn't seem like an ordinary man
More like a ray of light

You transcendentally imposed yourself upon my bed
You know you didn't say very much
I'm out of body and I feel so good in my head
You know I'm really quite touched

I wake up with your fragrance and it's all over me
What cologne do you wear?
I walk around with a smile on my face, 'cause you're close to me
Well I know you're somewhere

And I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined
You know just what I want and I don't have to ask
Are you reading my mind?

You're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare
You're not the least bit obsessed with your hair
You're not upset when I come home later than ten
For a ghost you're a very good friend

I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

I can't see you [so hot]

And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein

And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works, I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men

But have tested those who call themselves apostles
But are not and found them to be false
I know that you are enduring patiently
And bearing out for my namesake

And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned the love you had

I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews but they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping, praying for you to justify my love

And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bears

And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne, and great authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshiped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshiped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""

And the beast was given a
Mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against God

It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain

If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Then, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them and they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them

He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For these things will have passed away

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone""

And he said to me, he said to me
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near, let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy""

The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

You'll always be inside of my heart

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down

Who needs the sky, when the ground's open wide
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth
Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

Who needs to sleep (I hear your voice)

With your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat, make it loud
Let it hurt, run it through me.

Get this, just look at me dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show

Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up
With your nights, watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess

It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town, I love you
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown and silence.

You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death, you are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

Madonna,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days

It's happened at last, I'm starting to get started
I'm moving out with my man

Now Eva don't get carried away

What are you talking about?

She really brightened up your out-of-town engagement
She gave you all she had, she wasn't in your contract
You must be quite relieved that noone's told the papers, so far

She's made up her mind, you've no choice
Why don't you be the man who discovered her
You'll never be remembered for your voice

(Magaldi:)
The city can be paradise for those who have the cash
The class and the connections, what you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up in the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class ...

(Eva:)
Screw the middle classes! I will never accept them!
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight, hidden from view at his funeral.

(Eva's brother:)
Do all your one night stands give you this trouble?

(Magaldi:)
Eva beware of the city
It's hungry and cold, can't be controlled, it is mad
Those who are fools are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become what they should not become
Changed, in short, they go bad.

(Eva:)
Bad is good for me
I'm bored, so clean, and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here, so why oh why oh why the hell can't I?
I only want variety, of society

[Chorus]

(Magaldi:)
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say, ""You have your way, come to town.""
But you'll look at me with a foreigner's eyes
The magical city, a younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down

(Eva:)
All you've done to me, was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city games alright, didn't I?
I already know what cooks, how the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn't I?

Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Of basking in my spotlight

If the bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rock n roll
And can music save your mortal soul
And can it teach me how to dance real slow

'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes

With a great carnation and a pick up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck

I started singing

Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy
But the levy was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing
This will be the day that I die
This will be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well I went down to the sachet store
Where I heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
Well now in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all broken
And the three men I admire the most,
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
I started singing

Will take us away from here

Sometimes I want to tear it all down

And hard to go away from the crowd

And I know that love will keep us together

Madonna,"There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
I gotta give it up

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

How many times I've died

I'm not that kind of guy

I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I feel closer to the light

To improve my life

Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Just take it from me

It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Madonna,"I don't like cities
But I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork

Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby you can keep

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

If you don't like my attitude
Then you can F off
Just go to Texas
Isn't that where they golf?

New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat
Then get off my street
Get off of my street
Get off my street
You get off of my street
Get off my street
You get off of my street
Get off my street
Just get off my street

Other places always make me sad

Madonna,"Staring up into the heavens
In this hell that binds your hands
Will you sacrifice your comfort
Make your way in a foreign land

Wrestle with your darkness
Angels call your name
Can you hear what they are saying
Will you ever be the same

Imminilalo Imminilalo

Remember, remember
Never forget
All of your life has all been a test
You will find the gate that's open
Even though your spirit's broken

Open up my heart
'Cause my lips to speak
Bring the heavens and the stars
Down to earth for me

Madonna,"You can call me a sinner
Or you can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden
You'll be the snake
All of my fruits
Is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because
This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no

Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox
And it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the femme without the fatale
Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot
Under the vine
Fill up your cup
And let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true","Don't Cry for Me Argentina, song (for the musical Evita)",2006

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Madonna,"I have a tale to tell

I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard
That it sends your body flying across the room
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge, isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world, I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside he loved me

It was a time I suffered so much
I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms, not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain
That was eating me inside, nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and it invades me

I believe we are messengers on earth
I believe in Angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much
To become who I am today

Now you have to realize not only do I have a family
But now I have a whole hood and that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang, I just wanted to fit in

But one day I was forced to do something
That made me open my eyes and realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap

Hope I live to tell

Madonna,"I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

[Chorus:]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

[Chorus:]

Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmmmm, mmmmm

Now I find I've changed my mind

My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it

If I'm in charge
And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain

I can see you understand me
Tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

I don't think you've gone that way
I could bring you so much pleasure
I'll come to you when you say

I know you want me
I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm not gonna hurt you
Just close your eyes

Erotic, erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
All over me

Can make you feel better

Can take it away

Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when earth shall be as one

You were the sun
You taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees
I didn't know why
I started to breathe
I wanted to cry
I need a reminder
So I can relate
I need to go back there
Before it's too late

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

Madonna,"I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe those things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

All my dreams they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

So far away

When no one's around then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart,
When we're six thousand miles apart

Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we’re at our best when we're miles away

Madonna,"I should have seen the signs way back then
When she told me that you where her best friend
And now she's rolling rolling rolling
And you where stolen stolen stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it won't be the same)

I should have seen the sign when you weren't here
Under a different light it's oh so clear
She was stealing stealing stealing
And now your feeling feeling feeling
She started dying her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She's started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The feelings are momentary
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it wont be the same)

She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh devoted for life make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time I guarantee we are fine
She's not me

I know I can do it better
If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up all the things you like
You gonna have to watch your...

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (it wont be the same)

Never let you forget (She's not me)
She's Not Me and she'll never will be (repeat 2x)

Pharell-
Gotta find a new way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit say you love me love me
Guess my expectations hit the ceiling
When you come back it will cost us trust, trust me

She's not me, She's note me, She's not me and she'll never will be (x2)

Never will be",She's Not Me,2008

Treat me like a curse
And tell me I'm your savior
I'll never know the stranger
I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

First you say you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you
When you sold it to yourself

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up

Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter

Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey

I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept my big mouth closed
I could have just done what I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you
I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
Do you wanna know how to make out loud
Telling your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Fill it up with Warhols
It would be so cool
Coulda gone buyin' estates in the countryside
With a pack of great things
Kissing eye to eye
We coulda do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We coulda found a mountain seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda got a building built on the echo run
We coulda got ourselves arrested and sold our mum
We coulda live like crazy til' the day we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Je suis desole
I wish I could take you back but I can't

This is your life
Children on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messengers, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multi-task
Connecting to the WIFI
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweetin’ on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don’t even feel the pressure

I’m gonna be okay
I don’t care what the people say
I’m gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I’m gonna live right

I’m moving fast can you follow my track?
I’m moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don’t give a

You were so mad at me
Who’s got custody
Lawyers suck it up
Didn’t have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the biters have to go
Standing in the front row

And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?

Madonna,"When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can’t get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I’d write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

Feels like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love
(I’m addicted to your love)
(I’m addicted to your love)

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It’s like MDMA and that’s OK

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don’t care if you think that I’m strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I’m ready to take this chance
I need to dance

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Madonna,"If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move
It seems to me is what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seem to me is what you're like
The ""look but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

You can call my name and I’ll be a around

The way you think
But I don't miss
The way you used to drink

I miss our talks
The Universal Law
You had a way
Of seeing through my thoughts

It's so confusing I thought I met my match
An intellectual would telling for a catch
You always said we be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regret
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the country side where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it

You wrote me poetry
You had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets

I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I lost my very best friend (lost my very best friend)
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend

Saved the best ones that I have

But it wasn't always bad

I feel an ache I’d kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure so sure I’d struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark

See our hearts are intertwined
Then I’m free, free of mine
I’m falling free

And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love

And when you lift you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over Hope and Love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again

Madonna,"I live my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say ""told you so, told you so""
Why can't you be like the other girls
I said, oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me
All of the things I did, just to be seen",Rebel Heart,2015

Madonna,"Life was so crazy
You've been through a lot
I tell you stories some times you know

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize, my every single move
But then I realized, I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise, when I became the news

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark

I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

(Talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say your little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two 
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybpdy
And trapster, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messaiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark

Madonna,"I've lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say,
'Told you so, told you so!
Why can't you be like the other girls?'
I said, 'Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be'

Thought I belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Trying to fit in but it wasn't me
I said, 'Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for'

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say,
'Look at you, look at you!
Trying to be so provocative'
I said, 'Oh yeah, that was me'
All the things I did just to be seen

Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, 'Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be'
I said, 'Hell yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be'

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart

Life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell your story sometimes, you know

Seem like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower East side
I threw my tag around, let b-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became my muse

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh I came, I saw, I conquered

I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I know I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (music saved my life)

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh, I came, I saw, I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two bigaloos
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
And trappers, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark

Madonna,"In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between

Life is like a desert
An a oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razors edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

Turn a blind eye, try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or running away from all this madness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me

Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You could thread a needle with a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice to be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me
From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come

Madonna,"I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with a fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist
Put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil
Watch you slither away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh so divine

Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

A smiling face, a warm embrace,
Two arms to hold me tenderly.

And I know he's looking there for me.
 
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine,
Then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine.

Era o dia da festa
Maio de amores

Era o dia de cantar
E uma falua andava
Ao longe a varar

Maio com meu amigo
Quem dera já
Sempre no mês do trigo
Se cantará
Qu'importa a fúria do mar
Que a voz não te esmoreça
Vamos lutar

Numa rua comprida
El rei-pastor
Vende o soro da vida
Que mata a dor
Anda ver, Maio nasceu
Que a voz não te esmoreça
A turba rompeu",Maio Maduro Maio [*],1995

Ai, é menos um dia a perder

E cantando andei menos mal
Se calhar mudei bem sei
Que não fiquei Igual

Tanto que passei tão longe daí
Que em mim um país construí
E assim foi melhor porque
Não senti o medo

E a minha canção lá deixava ouvir
O vento no mar o mar a bramir
À minha canção
Chegava esse mar que eu canto

Lá por onde andei
Nem julgo saber a viagem é
Um só lugar mas onde eu cantei
Ficava um sabor a sal

Houve até um dia em que imaginei
Que sempre que eu vinha cantar
Vinha a maresia boa
Para me ajudar

E a minha canção lá deixava ouvir
O vento no mar o mar a bramir
À minha canção
Chegava esse mar que eu canto

If you ever wanted to punch a hole in me
And find out what's in me
There's really nothing in me

And nothing stays the same
And nothing ever happens to you that will happen to you again
Or is this the way it was?
Was it this same room, this same fight, this same scene?
With us dancing on the kitchen floor
And the wind climbing in through the open window

I used to hear distant cracks out in the city night
I could swear some one was being shot down
Now we hear that all the time

So do you like where we're headed?
Does it make sense in your eyes?
Do you miss me, baby, when I fall asleep?
Do you reach out for my arm?
Do you find it's too far away?
Do you?

Now tell me I'm handsome
I will tell you we are really not old at all
There's no use to complain

Still you and no one else

So put your warm little hands where I can see them
Put those hands on my face
Now if you get any out of this
Then that's the thing that makes me sleep all day
And I'll explain my love for you
On another day",Hands Up – I Love You,2001

Adjust to what it takes

Irgendwann holst du sie ab
Du sehnst dich nach der weiten Welt

Never will he boost loose Phillies with the barcode
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or slit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip

DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha'd, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beatbox
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it

Doom! The Madvillain killin mad boom
Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The beat conductor smoke twenty-four/seven
Shady you can even ask my reverend
Willie knows, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my last dough, to pick up the sticky gold
I spark the lah, but don't {fuck} with speed or trees with seeds
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat when you try to react
Even your pops got smack
Even your moms got crack
Meanwhile!! While my bowl got packed

After you who's last, it's Doom, he's the worst known
That'll have your boom blown or even thirst bone
Rock it to a worst clone, just don't curse the throne
Own his own microphone, bring it everywhere he go
So he can bring it to you live in stere-ere-o
Pan it, can't understand it, ban it
The underhanded ranted, planned it and left him stranded
The best, any who profess will be remanded
Yes sir, request permission to be candid? Granted
I don't think we can handle a style so rancid
They flipped it like Madlib, did a old jazz standard

Don't mind me, I wrote this rhyme lightly
Off of two or three Heines, and boy was they fine, G
One Black, One Spanish, One Chinese
It keeps the woody shiny year round like a pine tree
Don't sign me I'm about to get a mil without em
Grab him off the shelf, he's the villain, and what about him
So and he's a jerk and you don't know him
Mad how he expand work but won't show 'em
Poor guys, what a sight for old, sore four-eyes
Now hook me with two apple pies and a small fries
All rise, so far art as a Rupple
So raw break it down and make quadruple
It's crucial, you could see it in his pupil
And this time when he get it he'll waste it on somethin' useful
Like getting juiced off a deuce-deuce of cokey
Keep it low key, known to pull a okey-dokey
Silly Goose, Doom is too jokey
Damn he could really use a room or a whole key
Egads, he got enough styles to start three fads
True dat, she bad, I wonder do she come with kneepads
What a call, what a real butterball
Either I get a strike or strike out, gutterball

And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses

Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll

A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off and ended it and dip
And if you spoke soft we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw, no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power

Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter of fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'

On a diamond mine grind, she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought, it's too thick
His assistant said: ""Doom, you sick,"" he said ""True"" through acoustics

They better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
During tornado time with no coat than I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child to finna smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient ""It's all in your imagination negro""
Ahh, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin', to date the Metal Fellow been rippin' flows
Since New York plates was ghetto yellow with broke blue writing

To rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton,"" alright, then

Yeah, check, it's enough

How M.E.D. hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Leave you with more holes than a dartboard

My niggas take no like Kobe
Even with the the arms of the Hulk, you couldn't hold me
From gettin mines, stogies be rolled, smokin and gettin by

Rien ne sert de courrir, il faut partir à point 
Pourquoi faire aujourd'hui c'qu'on peut r'mettre à demain 
Parfois peigner la giraf, c’est loin d’être malsain  

J'ai tendance à procrastiner 
Non j'peux pas fuir ma destinée 
je me l'fait souvent reprocher 
le monde est tout l'temps prêt, sauf moé 
Ok demain j'me lève plus tôt  
Je vais avec ma blonde chez l'gynéco 
Compter mes factures pour l'impôt  
Prochaine paye; j'règle le bill d'Hydro   

La dernière fois j'm'en souviens 
j'ai r'poussé l’tout d’une année  
parce que j'le sentais pas bien de travailler pour rien 
Envie de faire le malin  
De tout r’mettre ça à demain  
d’me pogner l’bac à deux mains encore procrastiner  

Que celui qui n'a jamais atermoyé 
se lève et me lance la première pierre 
car c'est dans la nature de l'être humain 
c'est d'apprécier rester assis sur son derrière  
je l’avoue, Je l’accepte et même j’en suis fier 
je l'sais que j'me répète; vous commencez à l'savoir 
J’m’en fais pas avec ça, parce que de toute manière 
Comme Bouddha, je vibre avec l’univers   

Ça m'arrive bein trop souvent de m'enfarger dans les lignes du tapis  Commencer mes journées par un trois heures de plus au lit 
perdre mon temps à m'occuper de trucs qui n'pressent pas aujourd'hui Flâner, glander, y'a toute une panoplie 
d'expressions pour étirer le temps à l'infini 
j'peux pas toujours être pro-actif, faut relaxer aussi 
savoir prendre une pause, un décalage choisi 
lentement mais sûrement, moi ç'a j'ai tout compris

Rien ne sert de courrir, il faut partir à point 
Pourquoi faire aujourd'hui c'qu'on peut r'mettre à demain

Quand la farniente m'envahit pas question d'faire la fourmi 
Non y’aura pas d’compromis  
j'dépense pas d'énergie
Pour tout un système maudit 
qui ne nous donne pas d'répit 
ma nouvelle idéologie :  
«ne rien faire m’enrichit»  

Même au moment de ma naissance 
pas pressé j'me faisais attendre.  
Y'a fallu qu'ils viennent me chercher 
c'est par césarienne que j'suis né.     

Bukowski pis Lebowski m'ont tout appris  
ç'a sert à rien de courir, j'carbure à l'ambroisie
je branle dans l'manche et pis j'avance comme la Zamboni

Une journée, une journée, une journée sans t’écouter
Pour moi l’ragga n’est jamais trop vite, ni jamais trop lent
Il est tout l’temps juste à point, comme les frites des Flamands 
La tentation de faire du ragga était si forte
C’est pas de notre faute, c’est la musique qui nous transporte
Notre esprit flotte à cause de toutes ces vapeurs fortes
Ne t’inquiètes pas c’est équitable, c’est une forme d’art que l’on importe.  

C’est une substance qui se promène dans mes veines j’suis un malade-man pour le ragga. Ça me donne à la fois chaud et froid.  Sur la rue Mont Royal, quand une voiture aux allures de soundsystem se ramène moi je n’ai pas le choix, je groove toujours à point sur le son du ragga.   
Tu peux me faire confiance mon gars c’est le style qui marche à chaque fois

J’ai la mémoire ben pleine de trous, moi-même j'suis flou
Faudrait quasiment qu'j'me call une civière

En train de me traîner les pieds, ses yeux m'ont enfargé

Accrochée comme par un fil invisible, accotée dans le vide

Moé pis une couple de chums, on fait d'la muz
Ça paye pas l'loyer pis ça coûte cher de booze

Quand on tourne, on ramène 50 balles
Les cachets, c'est pour payer la van,
La bière, le gaz pis les nuits au motel
Viens pas m'dire que la vie est pas belle
Après la gig, des fois, on part su'a cruise
Des filles willing qui nous ouvrent leurs blouses
Moé pis une couple de chums, on fait d'la muz
Ça paye pas l'loyer pis ça coûte cher de booze",Gig Brune,2012

Pas question d'aller en camping, on va au centre d'achats
Laisse faire la marche en montagne, on s'en va dépenser

J'ai besoin d'Armani, Lacoste dans mon garde- robe
Masseratti, Hummer, 4 x 4 dans l'entrée d'cour
Parle- moé de Blackberries, iPhones, ou parle- moé pas pantoute
Caviar et Dom Pérignon, Luis Vuitton pas d'imitation

Le dernier jeu vidéo, la guerre en Nintendo
J'serai jamais rassasié, même en ayant tout acheté
Tacheté de marées noires le globe en a assez

C't'un monde de cartes de plastique...relents d'arsenic
Alléluia pour le gros fric tiré des fonds publics
À fond la caisse, avancer, l'premier qu'y'a tout brûlé
S’affaire à poser, fier de son brasier

Un arrière-goût de cendres voilé de chirurgies plastiques
De magazines glacés aux photos retouchées
De drinks énergétiques, de céréales toxiques
De vision à court terme pour faire un max de fric

Mais dis-moi donc pourquoi faire j'aurais besoin de toutes ces affaires- là
Cumuler sans limite, sans bon sens, j'en ai plein les bras

Patentes, patentes à vendre!

C’est la caverne d’Ali Baba, ça fait tout un tapage
On investit la ruelle, on parle le même langage
C’est la business annuelle, y’a pas de gaspillage
Panoplie d’trésors à rafler dans ma vente de garage

Y’a des cossins de toutes sortes, de la cave au grenier
Les trucs s’empilent à l’année, pis je n’ai pas l’cœur d’les jeter
Malhabile, j’essaye parfois de les recycler…
Ça traîne au point d’en faire déblatérer tout le quartier

Ma voisine d’en face crie : «Georges! Range ta ferraille!»
Ça pas rapport que j’y dis, j’m’appelle même pas Georges, tu dérailles
Elle passe sitôt me vilipender de son regard glacial
Mais drette en arrivant, elle fait 100 000 trouvailles
Elle me dit :

« J’te donne mes cennes si, j’te donne mes cennes si…
J’te donne mes cennes si t’as un bon deal pour moé! »

Y’a des racks à muffins pis des peluches à babines longues
Une machine à pop-corn jaunie des années cinquante
Un vieux toaster chromé à portes battantes
Des piles de vieux vinyles usés de musique de matante

Blazers, poteries, déshumidificateurs
Fire starters, pis des cartes de Guy Lafleur
Un casse de Chef Boyardee, moustaches du Bonhomme 7 heures
Un livre de Blaise Pascal, y’a tout pour faire ton bonheur

J’ai un poster presque neuf d’la Jamaïque
Original vintage plastique de Jabba the Hutt
Y’a tout le kit pour faire fonctionner ton Jaccuzzi
Pis tout s’envole plus vite que le flow à Jamalski

J’ai sûrement la bonne affaire, j’ai tous les n’importe quoi
Le paradis d’la patente, du bon deal à chaque fois
Ça laisse les bouches béantes, tu peux passer par là
Ici y’a pas d’arnaques, tu peux te fier sur moi…

J’ai des trucs aussi rares qu’un film québécois branché
Sans Rémi Girard, un faux vase Ming importé
Un vieux casse de motard, une p’tite statue du King plaquée en or
Perruque de Passe-Montagne pis un suit de toréador

Quand j’arrive le matin; méchante pile de cossins
Quand j’arrive le midi; y’a un peu d’stock de parti
Quand j’arrive le soir, ben là c’est facile à voir
Y reste pu grand chose icitte pis y commence à faire noir

Smoke-filled casinos, but what do we know we'll take a chance
Looking for cheap thrills and fast rides
Spin till we're dizzy, the gamble, the sleep and now we dance

We stumble up and down the concrete
Led by distraction, the empty attraction keeps us blind
Never intending for the complete
Like shadows and alleyways, the unknown continues biding time

We're chasing heaven as it fades into black
Can't get it back, no, we can't get it back
It's like we're running crazy 8s around the track
Can't wait to come back, can't wait to come back

Could you stay with me tonight?
We sleep for dreaming and away it goes
And I'll make you believe one last time
And let you feel it as my heart explodes

We sit and drink up on the cop car
Playing illegally, the boredom of fantasy, we're done
I've never, ever loved you so hard, but is that reality
We can't face the battle in the dark

We're chasing heaven as it fades into black
Can't get it back, no, we can't get it back
It's like we're running crazy 8s 'round the track
Can't wait to come back, can't wait to come back

[Chorus x2]

We sit, we think, and we figure out just right where to start
As these waters rush together, we keep ripping them apart

Have we now reached the end...just to find the beginning again?

Just one more chance
To get me anywhere
Been running down any road but home

I know I'm running and I'm moving too fast
So we will go home
And where I'm headed to it's nobody's guess
So we will go home
So when we go home

I saw the map like any other one
I cannot find and follow lines
That led me to question

But I can see it in the symmetry
It's what was really always meant to be
The singularity is clearer from the distance
So I'd die here to fall in love with home

Staring into mirrors
Lost in the design

Where the future and the past cannot contain

Oh but I was wrong
This fair comes with a price because tonight I'll wake up twice and
Both times find you gone

Is all we have and when it's over
Reflections 
Of the path that sends us searching over and over again

Too quick to fall asleep again to find you
I'm rushing through a dream I can't control
This house of mirrors beckons us to walk through
But instead again I have to let you go

Stuck here in this stare revealed beyond the glare
Again you're gone
So throw a stone through these reflections scatter light in all directions
And sing this song

Where does the physical meet with the spiritual?
Is this the typical question?
But down below and up above
It looks the same so I'm not sure of anything
Where will love come from again?

Got to thinking that how easy it could be
But then the fear and the chains became a part of me
And waiting

Always waiting
For my ride to pick me up on my time
Seems I'm staying 
As the others cross the finish lines
I could break into day I could set into speed
But to tell you the truth I'm always waiting
Always waiting

Caged in like the beautiful view
And I was waiting for the night when I could soar with you
But when you picked me up released me to fly
I found I couldn't hold my own wings dry

In the back of my mind there will always be the catch and throw away.
But this moment's got me thinking I could reach you. And I'm waking up alone and echo the song sung yesterday and begging you to come back home.

Cause you're my boomerang. My repititous twist of fate. But unexpectedly this time you don't come back to me. Still you go on and on for someone else.

This back and forth gets me going around and round. And I'm so worn out and dizzy while you knock the good ones down. Now I want to know the truth- do you even miss you?

Cause in the back of my mind I could always feel the push and pull away. And now I can see that you were leaving me. 

When you're my boomerang and I tried so hard to make you stay. Without a doubt I see this time you won't come back to me. 

So fly, fly, fly like a bird in the atmosphere. Glide, glide let the breeze you're feeling take you there. Fly away from me. 

In the back of my mind there'll always be the catch and throw away. But this time I'll let it fly and not try to reach you. Because getting up alone will help me grow my own pair of wings and the time has come for me to fly. 

Oh boomerang,I'm down to let you go, cause you're my boomerang. And the fun we had was all in vain. But unexpectedly this time you won't come back to me. Still you go on and on for someone, go on and on for someone else. 

Fly, Fly, Fly like a bird in the atmosphere. Glide, glide let the breezed you're feeling take you there. Ride, ride on the wind the gets you out of here. Fly away from me.

Mae Barnes,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

You'll be so lonely
You'll be so lonely, you could die

Well, though it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom
And they'll be so, they'll be so lonely, baby
They'll be so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die",Heartbreak Hotel,1956
Mae Glover,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.

A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

Mae McKenna,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Poet, angel it was his idea

I've got a view nobody's seen
I read Burroughs but I keep it clean
I go places inside my head
With an eye on tomorrow to keep my soul fed
I came here of m own accord
I came to witness the unexplored
Green valleys and a fertile sea
I came to rediscover the real me
I like it here at least so far
I've got no plans of saying au revoir
Elevated visions when I close my eyes
Stretched out underneath these amaranth skies
Make me feel...
Closer than I've ever been to being alive
Since I've arrived in Bohemia
Late afternoon is a time to dream
I like to listen to Coltraine's ""A Love Supreme""
Then I leave my rented room and I walk
Through the fading light down streets that talk
I always meet someone I could call a friend
Prejudice is something we must transcend
Coming into season this world will flower
With the power of love, not the love of power
And I feel, closer than I've ever been
To being alive since I've arrived in Bohemia

Past the shops now long closed down, walk with me again
Wrap this night around your memory and close your eyes
Can you feel the Russian wind blow through the city sky?

Fall with you
(High above the ground)
Leaves spiral down and I
Drift and fall with you

And when it rains a grayer canvas, you have never seen
Stand beneath this canopy of crimson laden green
Wait inside the shadow cast by summer's long retreat
Walk with me back along this late September street

Fall with you

Leaves spiral down and I
Drift and fall with you

Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest

Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

Amiga te pido que te quedes un poquito mas presiento 
Que voy a decidirme a decir la verdad amiga 
Más late el corazón si estoy cerca de ti 
No miento y él sabe que yo a ti no te podría mentir 

Y es que tú no entiendes que te estoy amando 
Que este amor se crece y tanto me hace daño 
Me duelen tus besos como tus abrazos 
Yo te quiero amiga como una mujer 

Para poseerte y para acariciarte 
Y hacer el amor contigo cada instante 
Si miran mis ojos verán tu reflejo 
Y esa indiferencia a mi me va a matar 

Quiero ser tú dueño
Quiero ser tú amante y la ilusión que tienes de sentir que te amen 
Tuyo es el amor perfecto en toda parte 
Y yo estoy tan cerca y no puedes sentir este amor amiga

Contigo aprendí a vivir 
Este amor en silencio cada anochecer 
No ves que de rodillas estoy diciéndote 
Tu beso en mi mejilla desgarra mi piel 
 
Amiga te pido que te quedes un poquito mas presiento

Preguntaste nerviosa cuando me aleje

Penas y alegrías todo disfrute

Regrese
Porque a pesar de lo lejos serias para mi 

Al final
La distancia no importa si he vuelto por ti

No, por amor de Dios quédate a mi lado

Te encontré en la vida 
No te dejo escapar

Que mi nombre en su pecho grabado deje

Maelo Ruiz,"Yo no entiendo como pude acabar un día 
Tanto amor que tu jurabas por mi sentías
Y después de tanto tiempo no consigo 
Comprenderte pero sigo de ti estando enamorado 

Como imaginar que yo no me daba cuenta 
Que lo nuestro lentamente iba terminando 
Hace tiempo lo sabia pero no quería creerlo
Yo decía que sin ti no viviría 

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos en mi mente 
Quédate un día en mi presente

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos por un día,un día
Un día solamente un día 

Anda tu a saber que cosas tiene el destino 
Que cuando menos lo piensas rompe un cariño
Y que frágil es la vida no consigo comprenderte
Por que sigo de ti estando enamorado 

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos en mi mente 
Quédate un día en mi presente

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos por un día,un día
Un día solamente un día 

Te amo es tu amor caminos con espinas que después de tanto amor no queda nada 
Se acaba se acaba 

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si te vas un día llorare
Yo no quería creer que sin ti no viviría 
Llorare por si te vas un día llorare

No se como pudo acabar el amor que tu sentías

Si alguien te lastima debes pensarlo dos veces
Y al final de cuentas paga la misma moneda

Amor con mas amor se devuelve

Me diga ya no manda
Pero si ami me duele te duele
Me entrego hasta que el corazon me diga
Ya no mas, pero si ami me duele te duele

Que a ti tenia que hacer pensar que si me lastimaste
Tenia que curarme solo las heridas super que el
Amor fue solo de mi parte como no arrancarte
Lejos de mi vida si tu amor me ah dicho basta el mio
Te hará la despedida

 This joint's dedicated to all emcees 
 Yo, stay focused with this 
 A'ight 
 Stay strong, stay dedicated 
 Maestro 
 Check it out, yo 

 Yeah yeah, yo 
 I'm still smashin' it 
 So compassionate 
 House of Commons want me on the cabinet 
 The graduate who got the phattest shit 
 I splatter shit 
 Niggas better scatter when I'm splashin' it 
 Flashin' it 
 Pass the record books and watch me shatter shit 
 I made the city hot 
 Rhymes makin' niggas drop 
 Even free-stylin' when CKLN was fifty watts 
 Then I built the strategy 
 Gradualy, I planned to be 
 The greatest from the city 
 Brothers started stabbin' me 
 Made your backbone slide to this, glide to this 
 Brothers jealous 'cause their sons couldn't shine like this 
 It ain't my fault that my song's phat 
 It ain't my fault that my pops loved my mom, black 
 I made the bomb track 
 Kids were jackin' for beats when my rap hit the streets 
 I went to church and even signed my autograph for the priest 
 When my track was released, you noticed me 
 Toronto prodigy of poetry 
 Even white chicks were faintin' over me 
 The flyer boss, toured like Diana Ross 
 It kills me when I see you young brothers tryin' to floss 
 You got a long way to go to keep the hip in the hop 
 I left in ninety two, it's like the fukin' industry stopped 
 But it's on, don't panic 
 Emcees stay frantic 
 It's automatic, we makin' audio dramatic 
 Lyrically I'm a bill, at the top of a hill 
 Show my sons how to chill, and make the city stand still 

 [Chorus: Wade O. Brown] 
 We're gonna make it happen 
 We're gonna make it shine 
 We're gonna make it happen 
 It's a race against our time 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 We're gonna make it happen 

 [Maestro] 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I remember when my pops took me to this lady 
 She said she couldn't believe how many shady people want to slay me 
 She said they want to wreck you, they want to wet you 
 But don't sweat it, your ancestors will protect you 
 Many nights I woke up, frozen stiff, couldn't move 
 Stayed calm, bible open on the twenty third song 
 Who could it be now 
 A brother that I ripped, an old school shorty that I used to hit 
 (go figure) 
 In life I learned cats'll try to hurt you 
 That's why I gotta stay tight with my family, and keep a small circle 
 Many broads said to me, that my seed they wanted to carry 
 Didn't love me at all 
 But to shine, they wanted to marry 
 Sayin' ""let's sex tonight"", but I'm a skeptic type 
 It's a rougher world 
 That's why it's tough to trust a girl 
 Never the less I'm maintainin', with pure determination 
 Two junos, plus ten nominations 
 No way I'm gonna crumble, I stayed humble 
 I reminisce when K-4CE teamed up with MC Rumble 
 T-dot, nineteen eighty six, turned the party out 
 Gave love, but didn't have to sweat the brothers down south 
 It's on, don't panic, emcees stay frantic 
 It's automatic, we makin' audio dramatic 
 Lyrically I'm a bill, at the top of a hill 
 Show my sons how to chill, and make the city stand still 

 [Chorus] 
 [Wade O. Brown] 
 I know, for sure 
 That we're bound to make it 
 In time, we'll find 
 It's the sky of ?
 Oh oh oh 
 We're gonna make it happen 
 We're gonna make it, We're gonna make it 

 [Maestro] 
 Yeah 
 You could never make the city smile 
 You're Conway Twitty style 
 Silly pile for real 
 You ain't a willy child 
 I cap your dome, everytime I rap alone 
 Plus the way I chaperons, make the feds tap a phone 
 I elevated you, you know who educated you 
 Peace to Ron Nelson, he put me on in eighty two 
 Now I'm comin' back 
 I got the stunning tracks 
 Spreadin' love to all my peeps and show the younger cats 
 Hit 'em with the phattest songs 
 Fuck the sprint, it's a marathon 
 I seen a lot of shit, now I'm passin' it on 
 I love Redman and Naughty shit 
 But now I'm on some Barry Gordy shit 
 I need another forty hit 
 It's on, don't panic 
 Emcees stay frantic 
 It's automatic, we makin' audio dramatic 
 Lyrically I'm a bill, at the top of a hill 
 Show my sons how to chill, and make the city stand still 
 It's on, don't panic 
 Emcees stay frantic 
 It's automatic, we makin' audio dramatic 
 Lyrically I'm a bill, at the top of a hill 
 Show my sons how to chill, and make the city stand still

Maestro Fresh-Wes,"This is a throw down, a showdown, hell no, I can't slow down
It's gonna go down, first offense on the mix down, go on and break down
Okay, party people in the house, may I have your attention, please?
In a moment, the beat will be played in many parts, come on and break
Many parts, many, one, two, three, come on and break

This jam is amplified, so just glide and let your backbone slide

You listen to every word I say, I, every verb you heard
I play snaps a vertabrae, you try to cover, a hover me, a roast, a fake
A flag, then I run a post, toast, I'm the most, D-E-F's how it goes
No X's or O's or tic-tac-toes, L-T-D knows,
This ain't a game I'm on a mission,
Call me a hip-hop, tip-tac-tition,
I rap just like a slab of clay, that's shapeless,
Champagne no shimmer no glass is tasteless,
A universe without light is light less
That's why I always take time to write this
I mold it in my hands before I start chiselin'
Could be a rain or brainstorm or drizzlin'
Sun could be shining, sun could be showerin'
Practice make perfect and I'm powerin', flowerin'
My lyrics are awesome, tunin' from human, bloomin' a blossom
Blowing away blockades and barricades, make ya black and blue
From the blast and the blaze, it's a bloodsport, bloods builds up back
I make your vision go blurry while your brain goes black into oblivion
Beats from box to box to bates, rocks from blocks and blocks
Let your backbone slide

Just let it slide y'all, I don't give a damn, damn, if ya backbone quiver
Man, oh man, watch ya swiver,
Wind some twine your spine while you're slither,
It's contagious, a epidemic,
You try to lift you're cool but it fell again,
Rap scholar, soul like a Dominican
Butt like I said before, ""I'm not American
It's who you are not the where you went, we all originate from the same descent""
I make a lot of cents, sense and pence, gold, myrrh and frankincense
When I'm in France they blow me francs, Frank
With your Swiss account is the way I bank-pank, at home I make bills
Are brown from my sound in the States, green like the grass
In the ground when I'm in England, they pass me pounds now
I clock cash in every town, so I slide but nowadays, I'm trapped
Why's that? So many suckers on my sacroiliac
It's like a rap-sack, backpack, wic-wic-whack, give me some slack jack
Rap is like a jungle, where rhyme for rhyme is like a vine to vine
Swung line to line of mine, I'm colossal, you'se a mosquito
I'mma play Tarzan, you play cheetah, cheetah, bitter love to forge
Better yet, I'll call you curious George 'cause curiosity cold killed the cat
Can't hide so black to the side, let your backbone slide

The keyword is synchronism, yo, check out my homeboy dance to the rhythm (Hey)
This ain't Forte, I'm coming Double-F, Fortissimo, FF for funky fresh,
My DJ is LTD, mellow-flex
You listen to the poetry, big jumbo jet,
Vocabulary golden beats from my rollin'
Stone cold lyrics with the microphone
I'm holdin', words I rip, egos I strip,
I make sucker crews kick Dick Van Dyke flips,
I get busy, they're dizzy, they start to collide they should've stepped off,
I let it slide, but now they got brazen
Dry like a raisin, I glaze like a vase, I smash you like days until
They realize, they shouldn't have ripped, it's '89 y'all,
Not Beethoven's fifth or sixth, it's a throw down, I'm conducting it
Because like a high rise I'm constructing it,
T'was once thoughts, pen and paper
Now it's a tower, a soul, a skyscraper,
It's getting out of hand after I've created a monster,
My musical monologue makes you wanna move with the Maestro,
You feel hot so you set the blend the crescendo is nice yo,
I'm the guy, the rhythm is a ride
To the fresh side and let your backbone slide, this is a throw down",Let Your Backbone Slide,1996
Maestro Fresh-Wes,"(Sugar, sugar, sugar) ( 4x )

[ VERSE 1 ]
As I walk into the room, it's easy to assume
A brother like me loves the girls with a boom
Coolin with my fellas, talkin how we makin ends 
Walkin through the 'valley of the skins' like my nigga Trendz
Seen a hot dame, I had to kick game
Not a regular type of hottie I be seein on the train
Voluptous, I was presumtuous
So I had to step up, step up, step up to this
She said, ""You can't handle this
I'm livin far from scandalous
I don't drink beers, don't smoke cannabis
Don't need a man for shit 
I'm an independent chick
Salt-N-Pepa type of heffa, yeah, I'm on my own dick
Never actin pompous, I'm strictly conscious
Got goals in life that I'm tryin to accomplish
A real good looker, far from a hooker
My first name's Brown and my last name is Sugar""

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2 ]
You shoulda seen it, hops, she raised my eyebrows
The way the titties went bang and that ass went pow
She said, ""My hair's always done, nails always polished
Got knowledge, plus I go to a all-girl college""
I had to step in and started tellin her
""Baby look, all-girl college pussy ain't no better than the regular""
( Laughter ) She started laughin and said I was cute
But I ain't cute, you're cute with that skin-tight suit
You see what I'm sayin, I wasn't sweatin her
But my game was on point cause I was gettin her
Wettin her, lettin her
Check me out with her retina
Scopin that ass just like a predator
She said, ""Wes, you're a real cool brother
Damn, why didn't I met you earlier this summer?""
I asked why, she said, ""You got mad flavs
But I'm goin back to college and I leave in two days
But don't get me wrong, word to my moms
I'll be back for Thanksgiving, so you know I put you on""
You know I had a front like I was chillin
But deep down inside ""Let's hit in now, money, fuck Thanksgiving""
I said, ""Baby doll, don't play 
You know a brother like me gives thanks every day""
She said, ""Don't even try it, I'm far from a hooker 
My first name's Brown and my last name is Sugar

[ CHORUS ]
	No additives, no preservatives 
	Strictly 
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	A granulated, often imitated, never duplicated brown

[ VERSE 3 ]
She said, ""Wes, don't look at me as just sexual
I mean, I know I look good, but shit, I'm also intellectual
I caught ya peepin my behind
But we got so much in common, let our minds intwine""
""I hear what you're sayin,"" is what I told her
""And it seems like you got a good head on your shoulders
And yeah, I must admit that your style's slick
But fuck that Janet-Jackson-Let's-Wait-A-While shit""
She said, ""The more we talk, the more I'm with this
But don't get me mixed up with all these other bitches
I just met you, I ain't with it, but I'll admit it
When I come back I might let you hit it
I can't play myself and look soft
Cause in 1994 you know I'm comin off
I got my act down pat, proud of bein black
Don't need a nigga for jack, and my pockets stay fat

Maestro Fresh-Wes,"[Chorus]
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock rock
To the beat that I drop when I flip my hip-hop
Put this in yo' collection
Fresh Wes without a rhyme is like certs without the retsyn

I'm coming straight out of Canada
Far from an amateur
LT's my DJ, Flex is my manager
I flow so nice so they're calling me the Maestro
Just pass the microphone
Fuck the light show
Real rap is in effect
And I'm out to get wrecked on the mic-mec
When I make a mic-check
Not on the sloppy tip
I'm harder than a hockey stick
Exciting niggas like Italian's in a Rocky flick
Adrian
Watch me flow slow or flow fast
I'll even make a Spanish brother say no mass
I'm wrecking you, disconecting you, disrespecting you
Hold your smoking ass cheap shit, it'll eventually catch up to you
I can make the phony retire, tendoroni perspire
She's on my back like my name's Jacobey and Myer,
(what's your name?)
It's Fresh-Wes with the sweeter beats
I make you smile like the brother on the red box of cream of wheat

[Chorus]

I got more rhymes than Brits in a cathedral
My cerebral is lethal
Nobody's equal, my people 
Want to hear a funky new style so get with it
No dibby-dibby-dibby MC's are permitted
I'm wrecking it good
(what else)
Collecting, injecting, and checking it good
(where?)
Lake Edna or your neck of the woods
I'm getting more blow than Chuck Mangeony
Not a phony
But Joanie wanted me for holy matrimony
Girls like my flavor cause I jam harder
Let's have a nice quiet date
You, me, and my camcorder
It's like a power-burst, I'm more than just an hours worth
I get down and dirty, but uh honey
Take a shower first
You can't tell me that the bro's soft,
I do the cabbage patch, butterfly, and boggle with my clothes off
But that's a different chapter
I've even got more rhymes than there's groupies of Jack the rapper,
On the microphone I slice you and make you say
(I knew his rhymes was phat, but his beats are kind of nice too)
Now is the apocolypse
MC's are clocking this
They say they got skills but all I'm seeing is a flock of lips
Acapella, or over a drum track
I'm funkier than a group of Jamacians after sun splash

[Chorus]

The word Maestro is teacher in Italiano
I'm from Toronto, causing drama on the the verazono
So come and check a real pro
Grab the piece of steal, yo
I make a Black activist say
(yes, that's my neigro)
When I said the mic's my piece I really meant it
So just like the Blue Jays, I'm out to win the pennant
So sucker chill, 'cause every head I struck I killed
Oh, I don't know, is it just me, or am I really that fucking ill

[Chorus]",Certs Wid Out da Retsyn,1998
Maestro Fresh-Wes,"My rhymes are stinging like a killer bee
My cometition are wishing that killing me
For my similies and solioquies
They garbage, but I'm the largest
With the hardest style to disregard
Check your cartridge, on your tech-niques
Wes speaks, over the best beats
Fresh until the next week
I'm outlandish, I bandage the mic bringing anguish
I'm sturdy when doing the dirty language
And, it's time for me to raise my velocity
No animosity, my philosophy's a prophecy
Hipocracy, no that's the cameleon
How old are you evenin ?, they rhyming like comedians
They make me laugh because they styles are scrupulous
My body is my temple, my brain is my nucleus
A great exapmle of Allah's perfection
You're moving to the sounds of my fat selection
I'm simply spectacular, smooth like an Acura
Yo, check my vernacular

You need to devote more
Time into rhyming if you're hoping for dope scores of folklore
Creating a style and grow with it
Be prolific don't solicit
Be scientific, if it's wack go visit
The department of labour, the harder flavour
You can't savour, do rap a favour be a waver
In the front row, where the stunts go
'Cause the chumps know you can't flow
Plus, you're too gun ho
My rhymes are bionic, far from demonic
My phonics are supersonic, you're embryonic
I spray you like insecticide or pesticide
Let's decide the best vibe for Wes to ride
Cool, time for me to synchronize bass and highs (for my enterprise)
I'm simply spectacular, smooth like an Acura
Yo, check my vernacular

Break it down
I'm smoother than the Philharmonics with my killer phonics
And melodic, shit I'm fucking iller than a fill of chornic
On the streets I'm known, I use a sheet to bone
On the sneak, Dominique Simone
Thicker than Hagan Dasz, bitches stop and pause
Niggas stocking yards, pass me cars, I'm knocking jaws
Biter flee, recognizing me
Wrecking title gee, 'cause inside of me is like Hepatitis be	
I'm a whirlwind, fireballs I'm hurling and swirling
No discussion, I'm crushing walls of Berlin
Seen many thesauruses, pleny clitoruses
Ready to score with this, huh, packing punch like Terry Norrises",Check My Vernacular,1998
Maestro Fresh-Wes,"Yeah, going out to all my peoples, you know what I'm saying
Now move to a higher level, I'm sprint
First I inhale, then I exhale Allah's name
You never see me pointing to the next male
Never seen me judge my 'cause, I'd rthter show love
'Cause poverty's got a grudge and the grudge won't budge
But nigga's gotta do what a nigga's gotta do
What's nigga gotta do to make dough and watch the zeros grow
I'm working hard, I make a beat I make a rhyme
Trying to make a dime, black man change your state of mind
Peace! to PE, BDP and X-Clan when I give a pound
It's never with my left hand
Styles are living long, you know my word is bond
'Cause my rhymes are cock strong
Like the fruit of Islam, word to God yo
Times is hard yo
I'm just a regular brother coming straight out of Scarborough
Fresh Wes'll never perpetrate and be a gun man
That shit'll be funny like Aaron Hall catching a suntan
I just be myself, maintain my health
Concetrate on my wealth, 'cause you know I go for delf
G-O-D's the only one who dictates
And before I plant seeds you know I got to get my shit straihgt
Concrete jungle's could trample
A little nigga without a father figure, or an example to follow
Young minds are getting swallowed by the devil
We got to help the youth, elevate to a higher level

No shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind
I ain't blind, I know the time
No shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind
I ain't blind, I know the time

Check it
I made a record hitting hard like a wall
I say without togetherness we got nothing at all
Progess will stall, the blackman will fall
And if you don't believe me, check the Final Call
I'm getting bolder 'cause I'm getting older
Some say I told ya, I known he had a chip on his shoulder
Nah, I love my people like a passion
Give me the opportunity, I write about unity
The community will prosper, or should I say grow
When brothers and sisters know the right way to go
I make beats and I'm all about peace
Refuge is what I seek from anxiety and grief
My mind stays focused, my vision stays clear
I concentrate on my career, successs is near when I say my prayers
I take a deep breath, I'm tired of being oppressed
I always try my best, Fresh Wes won't stress
I'm sharper than a shank, rhyme's heavy like a tank
I want to put my money in a blackman's bank
Point blank, I even met Queen Elizabeth
(You didn't bow did you Maestro?)
Money don't be ridiculous
That's some silly shit, you know she ain't significant
I only got to bow to Allah the magnificant
Through bass and treble, I never back peddle

Yo, I walk tall like Hanibal Adley
Hit a grand slam like my man Don Mattingly
Come prepared if you ever try to battle me (why)
I got rhymes coming out my anal cavity
Straight outta Scarborough
Ready to swing blows, niggas want to quit
Wash my nuts and my windows
I'm on your tape decks, rhyming to my apex
If a nigga don't like he can bite me with a latex
Because when I'm rhyming, heads are declining
Like Brian Mulroney, niggas are resigning
Competition ain't in front of me
Maestro where'd you get all these dope rhymes from?
I don't know, they just come to me
You fucking with a crazy brother
I don't kiss and tell, but I know your baby mother
I ain't bullshitting
Mmm, why did Gill cook a mean Curry Chicken
Time for me to get mad check(?)
So wack motherfuckers step to the left
I'm fat like a Cadillac, cut like a battle axe
I got crazy freaks, wash from BC to Halifax
Yeah, now the Maest is known
This beats alright, but now I thknk I want a xylophone
With my cipher grown, many mics are blown
You're in the Maestro zone
Now I gotta flow, hurdle any obstacle
Rhyme to show, and clock the dough
So many people try to stop the bro
But I smoke competition like an octago(?)
It's Maestro!, Fresh W-E-S big up to fly Ju(?) and my nigga big Jess
Yes, my peeps from 1-6-2
I met her last summer on Jamaica Avenue
Now every beat I made is a hit
But tell me, how many styles can one nigga flip?

Yeah, ha ha

From the lungs of the Maestro, hail the funk hail the phelgm
Niggas getting grim every time I begin
To bring the funk to radio stations to bump me
You should have never let my ass into your country
Word to God, I'm real hard
I'm even deadlier than Tony Montana with a green card
Fuck you and your demo tape
Instead of tryin' to imitate, innovate
I pull the mic but I don't pull cards
Bust your ass plus Julio down by the schoolyard
Don't try dissing me, because your style is history
I'm packing more flavour than the kernel's(sp?) rotisserie
I injure bone and I injure limbs
I've come a long way like Virgina SLims
I do a show with the Bandstand, never met the sandman
Chicks with the big tits give me a gland stand(?)
Older broads want to jock me, Elanor from Fox wants my rock
Let me stop, and burn styles
Chumps want to turn wild, you say you got dope
But why was your pops jumping turnstiles
You ain't got money 
I'm so dope, this shit's funny
All my jams is the shits
But tell me how many styles can one nigga flip?

Yeah, 1994 baby

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
First I learn to crawl, then I learn to walk
Then I learn to talk, then I learn to rhyme
Suckers try to hock my lines
But I'mma serve ya
On the microphone I murder
Killing chump rappers
Since the days of eating Gerber's baby food
The crazy dude with the pablum, the bad one
I grab the mic just like a Magnum
Fly girls was jiggling, clinging to my ding-a-ling
Wes, you was hitting skins as a baby
Yeah true but I was fingering
Yeah, check out shorty in the diapers
They're some big motherfuckers rhyming at the ciphers
Grown-ups knew that I be wealthy
They used to say
""that baby boy gots talent, but his mouth is so filthy""
I worte creazy rhymes to the beat
Had the, freedom of speech
But I still couldn't reach, the tall glass of milk
On the table, my lyrics were stable
But still I wasn't able to get it
I didn't sweat it, I paid it no mind
I wrote another fat rhyme at the drop of a dime
Now I'm hoping for the day to come
So I can hear my Dukes say, ""Wesley you son of a gun""

CHORUS X2
[Maestro Fresh Wes]
No time for chilling black
I wrote a killa rap, made an illa track
Knocking back the similack
Graduated from the formula, I had a scheme
Milk was calling me, just like the pipe to a fiend
But still I had to play cool, couldn't play a fool
So many MCs, are dropping out of pre-school
To get a record deal, forget it gotta hustle
Yo yo yo, how did money fall off?
Got lost in the shuffle
Ho thought he was a prankster
Every chick he'd meet he romanced her
Acting like a private dancer
But the music industry Hobbes, is serious as cancer
No place for a rapper, that still wearing papmpers
Even if you're signed, you'll still got to struggle
And making fat beats is just a piece of the puzzle
So props to the brother that made the Soul Clap
because my labels gave me flack money had my back
Forget the pacifier and your beachnut
Came out with three cuts
Now everybody's on these nuts
I got another rhyme, won't you check it
So fine tune the mic, engineer and I'mma wreck it

CHORUS X3
[Maestro Fresh Wes]
You know you got to go for self, support yourself
Like KRS said, you got to promote yourself
that's a fact not a fable, (word)
Get out the cradle
Or you'll be grippling with your record label
No time to play clown, if you want to stay around
Learn the business, and this ain't a playground
No time for Dr. Suess, or Mother Goose
You can rhyme and produce, but now you got to get loose
Just a piece of advice, now go your own path
And that allowance that you're getting money ain't gonna last
(What's this?) another fat beat that I build
You know It took a long time
But the borther's drinking milk

Be able to get a label to blast your procraster-
Nating the laughter, has to wait
After you pass the snake, stay awake Hobbes
That's the breaks
You want to make a record, check it
You need more than your boys around your way giving you credit
'Cause you can have a spectacular, vernacular
But take your contract to a lawyer to look after ya
'Cause labels have mastered the
Skill of gassing ya, after ya, dropped the flip like a spatula
Snatch your Acura
And all the bitches you wanted
Are flaunted your riches are laugh at ya
Cut you off like a dagger, support you like a laddere
Your pockets ain't fatter, you be sadder
So you better have a better strate-gy
Can't you see
It ain't healthy, nobody could tell me it's hell see
Takes more than a dope LP to be wealthy
Let me show you the path, you're going too fast
You're choking your promotional staff, ain't no knowing the half
They look and they laugh, and take time off
Cut ya off, no loss you're just a write off
Now you're feeling neglected and rejected
Check it, it's all about makin' records

Forgetting black man attacks man's upsetting and sweating ya pops
Ringing the bell, ringing 'em hell

You're outta here like flash dance
You and your wack stance
Regroup from your advance, fat chance!
You're say that you're only playing with your soul
You're innovative, but they got creative control
You're a puppet on a string, ain't got a fucking thing
You can sing so they cling, 'cause they know thay going to bring
Money with your rhyme but you're def dumb and blind
Don't waste time nigger, sign that dotted line

CHORUS X4
[Maestro Fresh Wes]
Now in the studio, you got the stupid flow
It doesn't matter tho, it's who you know
You think you got it bad, girls got it the harder way
Labels love to see a black woman in lingerie
What's a broad to say when a label say we'll make you millions
Buy clothes for your children, you know she hit the ceiling
They sing for me, we'll bring you G's
But injuries in the industry, could come instantly
I see the way they make a G a day, but what a fee to pay
Throwing and showing your T and A
You're taking a blow, your ass you shake it to show
Is raking the dough, but they played you and make you a ho
You're a piece of meat, between the sheets
'Nuff brothers seek to reach you, to freak or so to speak
Your Moms can't believe this, her daughter showing cleavage
She's speachless, and says oh help me sweet Jesus
Exposing the punanny, just to win a Grammy
But when that ass is flabby, you gone, word to daddy
Stop the degradation you're facing
This information I'm raising to the Queens of my nation
The shit can't prolong, goes strong
And when you sing a slow song (baby keep your clothes on)
Times are hard, many hearts are broken
Some start to smoke, Farrakhan ain't joking
When he said we're being setup
So black men and women keep your head up
When you're makin' records

CHORUS X4
OUTRO - Farrakhan sample
 ""The greatest musicians, the greatest rap stars. The greatest black 
artists, are sitting here today. But I want you to know, you're being 
setup. By the smarter that is coming down.""

Fresh Wes is on the mic mech, trying to catch wreck
Check the way I step to the set, then I gotta jet
Heck, chicks are getting kind of sexual
Always getting spectacles, glueing 'em to my testicle
Do yourself a favour don't step to the (Fresh guy)
Like TLC I put my Jimmy in your (left eye)
Ain't to proud to beg, beg for this
I'm gonna catch wreck, break a couple of necks
Cash a couple of checks, for the rhyme put together with the beat
(Showbiz) put together for, the streets and the jeeps
Fresh W-E to the S is (nice yo)
Don't say my name unless you going to say (Maestro)
Calling me an amateur I'll damage ya
Suckers saying (Naaah, dis kid can't be from Canada)From Amtrak, stages are sparked well

Doper than a South American cartel

The real steel when I reveal, they say (wheel)
And they eyes, be on the size gee
But don't try to milk me, or even homogenize me
I pasterize trying to skim through my papes I carry thee
Marry me for my salary, giving up your mammaries (naaah)
That ain't my type of event, or how my money is spent
I ain't Babyface payin' no rent
That's on the corny wack, Brady Bunch
Leave It To Beaver, Wally tip
My bozak ain't dangerous, so stop playing like Marley
Grip, skip to another Louie or Dewie or Ronnie
Donnie you're Johnny baby, yo kick that to Tommy
The softer guys, lost their eyes, off the prize
So stop the lies, you're wise or you're ostrosize
Drop your draws, lift the jaws
Because I'm in effect like Das and DMC, pause
The style I kick is uncategorical
You're prehistorical, go check the oracle
Damn I'm metaphorical

With real raps and feel that I should kill wack 
Niggas that peel caps and that ill crap 
Bigger threat than you with your tec when I rip the set 
Niggas get smoked like a cigarette, so hit the deck 
Watch ya chin, nigga, Ho-chi-min when I rock my shit 
When it comes to props I get lots of it 
I can get Madonna, money, your threats are minor 
And bet you find your girl with a wet pijama 
Drippin with my cassette behind her 
Got more band trail than your hand's sellin

Get real applausesteal broads' hearts at will force 
Hate a mark, skills lay a squad, and pray to god

Speed up a bastard's heart, great like jurassic park

Bringin my peers into tears, don't interfere 
Critics know I pack a wicked blow 
I put you in a clinic, so forget it like Riddick Bowe 
Nigga, go to hell, I flow so well 
Find another brother or mother or hoe to tell 
Or a bro to jeal', how's my jam gonna sell? Very well 
I send you back because you bring the wack 
I'm into rap, I interact with empty tracks 
Locked in, wack muthafuckas are blockin 
The Top 10 while the black radio jocks spin 
The calmer vibe, the modified 
I like the harder side, Jeffrey Dahmer tried, but died 
More words than a hour of scrabble, I got the power to battle 
Skadaddle or get devoured like the Tower of Babel 
Adversaries are snotty, some compare me to Gotti 
I bury a body, then carry a shotie 
The maestro rips the psycho shit 
Brain like a microchip, and I'ma excite you with 
The smoother rhythm, sendin mad crews to prison 
Who choose to listen while I use my you-4 missiles 
Collectin the pesos from a stage show 
Gettin fellatio from a h-o (why) because I say so 
My ratio expands as I wreck lands 
Makin def jams like Redman and X Clan 
I'ma nail the genitalia from Australia to Somalia 
Cause I'm smooth, just like a sailor 
I damage em all, bitches give me casual calls 
I'm slammin and jammin and rammin they vaginal walls

You know I smoke it like the flame to the tip of that bud, we just twistin' 
From another dimension, did I mention 
That funky, that's the only way we know how to get niggas 
Rhymes belimminent like a partial scholarship 
But my style's so heavy it make you lean when I drop 
Leave you spinnin' like the washin' machine before it stop 
Goin' all out, have to seal these motherfuckers fate 
On a mission from Cleveland, ridin' it from outta state 
So ready yourself because it's on full scale 
I heard some put Jamar to bail down to New Rochelle 
Now Rule, that's where we scheme and we plot 
On the late night, blunted in the basement with Sadat 
And we discussin' your demise, know it's gonna come 
Sure as the sun's gonna rise, send me the drum 
And Serge is buckin' off a shot from the mental insight 
Air tight, throw a worker from cradle to gravesite 

I feel lick a shot pum pum, push up on the one 
Original Flatbush style, and solo jam 
Like beep Han Solo man 
Yes-a, Mr.Intellect-And-Sex in the flesh 
I'm rougher than the hair on your girl's chest 
Maestro Manny one verse, time come in 
My ??? ??? scab when they go flurry 
You don't concern me, your style can't burn me 
You's about as hardcore as Big Bird, Bert and Ernie 
My steelo fat like your girlfriend, pregnant with twins 
After Thanksgiving then they're eatin' pork skin 
I don't give a fuck about your section, just watch your murder flexin' 
Step correct to the brother with the dark complexion 
6' 1"", two weaves and cocked diesel 
You can see that hair is curly, ain't no fuckin' up like ??? 
See!!!! 

When the corrupt stuff in my mind starts to erupt 
Even the hard niggas will be yellin' ""That's enough"" 
But what about my style, ooh child, I switch em up 
Rearrange em up, in other words I change em up 
Snagglepuss, I make a nigga fall like the season 
So exit stage left 'cause you ain't on my level, leaf 
You want to battle? Here's what happened to the last kid 
His wife became a widow and his kids became bastards 
In the rap profession, I'm not the one for testin' 
I'm the first to let'cha know I'm way dirty like mudwrestlin' 
So bring all the flunkies you roll with 
So when I set it on your ache, you all be like ""Oh shit!"" 
You want more so here we go, peep how my rap flow 
I'll have your ass sneakin' out the backdoor 
This is some trouble you don't want to get your ass in 
So watch your step and don't come out'cha mouth in the wrong fashion 

Feel the wind blow through your hair 
My aim is square on your backbone 
You're home alone and your mom work the double shift 
Just enough time for me to hit that off 
""Bounce on a nigga"" said my man Wop 
Peace to the squad, One-Eighth, Fo' and Teepee, check it 
I'm the type of nigga that'll walk down the street 
On some casual shit, even my kid could flip 
Hear me on the wop tape bam!! Hit 'em 
Hear me with the rhythm, yo you better go get em, check it 
Anticipation, you're waitin and waitin 
Peace to Courtland Ave., Teepee wheelnose in 
Satan, the early bird, aiyo that's my word 
My man Joon with the 'erb to the moon 
Eh Shawn Black, nigga, where ya at? 
No type of daydreamer or a nigga with emphysema

Não desvenda em teu riso um chorar tão magoado

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

Mafia & Fluxy,"Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyze the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier, in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America

Dreadie, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe yo, yo yo woe yo, woe yoe yoe
Buffalo Soldier, trodding through the land
Said he wanna ran, then you wanna hand
Trodding through the land, yea, yea

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America

Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland
To the heart of the caribbean

En una balanza puse los buenos y malos tiempos 
Para mi sorpresa me vi sonriendo 
Pero ala misma vez sentí mis lagrimas cayendo
Entonces me di cuenta 
Que yo nunca podría odiarte 
Nos hicimos tanto daño

Aun nos quedan las cenizas y memorias imborrables 
De un fuego que se apago

Mafia K'1 Fry,"Ne crains surtout pas d'être toi-même quand certains y voient faiblesse
Garde une balle pour ton rêve, en dépit des soucis, du stress
La mort ne paye pas son homme et le cœur de la ville bat toujours
J'rassemble mes forces et poursuis, tue les fantômes de l'amour
Ghetto fait son cinéma, qui en fait la queue devant le hall
Partout y a des fous, même les plus fous sortent de taule
Dessine-moi un mot nouveau, des thèmes comme on les aime
Oublie folie, car Fleury et La Santé nous freinent
J'voulais t'offrir ma vie et même plus, chaque texte un nouvel opus
Doit-on sauver un homme parce qu'on ne pourra les sauver tous?
La vie c'est des roses, pas besoin de daille
Pour prendre des pascals
C'est plus marrant maintenant que de changer à Châtelet-Les-Halles
Dis, qui est le voyou, le boss?
Dis, qui est l'as des as?

Machination comme les machines à sous de Las Vegas
Une forte pensée pour mes potos partis trop tôt
Quand la faux te fauche, dans le journal y a pas ta photo
On est trop à partir sans prévenir et quand la mort se dessine tu décèdes
Tu peux pas revenir, éviter les cris et les pleurs pour le futur
Chaque jour les mauvaises nouvelles déforment les figures
Tu joues les durs tu finis entre quatre planches ou quatre murs
Ça c'est pour mes négros mûrs et tous les quartiers
Faut être rusé
La rue c'est rasoir, poto

Trente ans sont passés et j'mène plus la même life
J'suis encore dans ce truc mais doucement quand je drive
Moi j'recherche juste l'équilibre, et pourquoi se faire la guerre
Alors qu'il faut déjà lutter pour vivre
Et non pas poursuivre le chemin de ceux qu'ont échoué
Que mon cœur batte chaque matin, c'est mon seul souhait
Garde le sourire malgré les douleurs du quartier
Précieuse est la vie, trop courtes nos amitiés, mon frère
Je suis partout comme la haine et la misère
La rue c'est rasoir

Les potos trop tendus comme la corde du pendu, trop têtu
Entends-tu la caution qui vient du ghetto
Resserré dans l'étau, à l'étroite à la gamberge de ce mec au détroit
Tu sais compter sur tes doigts, tu veux pas de sale boulot, c'est la routine
C'est la rue, c'est ""va te faire encoulo""
Cri du cœur, j'en bégaye, ça va vite
La rage partout où je vais me suit à la trace
Dans ma tête, dans mes tripes
Faut être rusé
La rue c'est rasoir

Constate, certains se contentent de dire que la fin du monde est proche
Pendant que d'autres ne cessent de se plaindre
Pourtant l'oseille mettent à gauche
Constate, l'obscurcissement du shéetâm, te bouffe, t'effleure de ses flammes
Tu te retrouves appât guidé par l'alcool, les drogues, les femmes
Ta vie c'est juste ce que t'en as toujours rêvé d'en faire
Fais-le, dis-le, aujourd'hui j'ai l'impression que c'est une faiblesse d'avoir du cœur
J'ai l'impression que trop de joies deviennent peurs devant trop de pleurs
Constate, les jours se déguisent en semaine
Les mois pour des années se prennent
Les décennies côtoient les siècles
A vingt piges j'gamberge la trentaine
Faut être rusé
La rue c'est rasoir

Tu crois que t'es tombé sur la bonne
Tu l'as à la bonne, t'es surpris comment elle donne
Pour son tarpé tu charbonnes
J'te vois tu bandes, tu bois, je l'vois pour ta bombe
T'aboies à chaque seconde quand des séries de rumeurs pleurent sur toi
Ainsi va ta vie, tu penses plus trop à tes vieux
Tu ne vis plus d'embrouilles, d'envieux qui ne cherchent qu'à te vé-cre
Le cœur creux tu crées, à ces conneries tu crois
Sois pas trop love, sois rusé
La rue c'est rasoir

Souvent dans mon cœur je ressens cette douleur intérieure
Venue d'ailleurs, elle me rappelle que mes plaies sont encore fraîches
J'attends que ça cicatrise, j'ai l'air triste
C'est seulement aujourd'hui que je réalise que sous l'emprise du mal et de l'alcool
J'respecte plus le protocole
Je regarde les petits de la tess cramer les bagnoles
L'infection s'étend facilement, tu peux prendre sept ans
Faut être très rusé car tu vivras pas plus de cent ans
La vie c'est rasoir

Mes cris, mes pensées, mes couleurs, mon bonheur
Toi, quand je t'aperçois, toi, quand on pleure
Ce que je ressens à l'intérieur
K'1 Fry du côté Mali, trop de mal à l'extérieur
J'marche, pourtant fort, la tête baissée à l'ombre
Des démarches que je rate et c'est mon cœur qui tombe
Mouso hot tesé, Ka ne ba
Molaségi, Djama
Ahé yayama m'ba sara
Djeneba
Seul, faut être rusé
La rue c'est rasoir

La rue c'est rasoir
Tu l'apprends vite à tes dépens
Dès que t'as plus de bavoir
Des bagarres
Dans une ruelle t'es arrivé au fond du tunnel
Pourtant dans un futur, une maladie comme la tumeur
Gros pour de vrai tu meurs, gros sois sincère avec toi-même
Car au fond ta vie tu l'aimes
La rue c'est rasoir
La rue c'est rasoir

Nous on dit pas ça en frimant
Du côté de chez nous, les calibres sont encore chauds et fumants
En passant lors d'une rixe tu peux te manger une balle fuyante
J'ai eu des millions de souhaits dans ma vie
Mais vu aucune étoile filante, en silence on souffre
On s'essouffle, on est friand de sensations fortes
Y a des jours où tu peux finir dans le coffre
Pour les brigands que la mort emporte
Pour les milliers de mères en pleurs
Rappelle-toi que tu pars seul gros, sans escorte
Les plus chanceux s'en sortent inchallah que ce soit dans nos cordes
La rue c'est rasoir mon pote
Sur ce morceau j'referme la porte, Mafia K'1 Fry, 9.4",Rusé (La Gamberge),2003
Mafia K'1 Fry,"Moi j'suis posé sur le living-room
3 heures du mat on frappe à ma porte
Ouais gros c'est moi Project
Est-ce que ça va? T'as des gadgets?
Viens dans la petite pièce dans le fond y'aura ce qui faut
Hey, tu veux
Quoi? Un couteau de cuisine ou un 11.43?
Non, on cherche du matériel lourd, genre scanner portable
Une gov' pour mon pote Dry
Dans le coffre de ta grosse berline allemande y aura de quoi mettre toute
Ta bande, attends 10 ou 15 minutes, et puis les vitres on les teinte
En même temps rajoute-moi des gants de chirurgien
J'en veux 16 pour éviter les empreintes et dis-moi, y'a des planques sur le côté?
Le moteur il est gonflé?
T'inquiètes il est gonflé à bloc, t'appuies à peine sur l'accélérateur et ça déboîte
OK, salut M'Key, j'ai RDV faut que j'me casse

Ouais, en fait tout a commencé sur un coup de tête
On a monté une équipe tu vois, une équipe solide
Chacun sa spécialité
Toi tu bouges pas, tu restes à ta place et t'attends ton coup de fil

Mon téléphone sonne
Popa, ouais gros j'suis opé, dans un quart d'heure à BP
OK j'suis dopé au sum, c'matin j'suis chaud bouillant
J'ai l'seum j'pense qu'à brasser, j'vais l'braquer
Moi et mes couilles que je ne cesse de gratter
Dans la caisse pas d'armure mais des gants
Juste un vieux pétard rouillé qui tire, poto putain j'prends la tire, j'me tire
Dans ma ligne de mire l'oseille
Pour ça j'tire les rapports, par rapport à ceux qui tirent
Moi j'tire sur les portes qui se tirent pas quand je rentre dans le P.M.U
J'suis rentré et sorti d'emblée, mec sans trembler j'ai largué les decks, le bolide impec
Mais putain faut que j'le tej, faut que j'm'allège de tout, ainsi que d'mon 3/4 beige
Tout ça fait, j'me défais de tous soupçons puis trouve AP
Pour qu'il me garde ma fraiche le temps que ce soit calmé

« Ouais, en plus, j'connaissais 2 mecs, 2 pointures
T'as vu des gars sûrs, pas trop grillés qui font dans la discrétion
Ouais des habitués de ce genre de boulot, des frères siamois, des mecs hyper synchros »

On fait pas dans la came ni dans les pilules
Même si on fait le sale boulot
Des sacs de sport, des thunes, des lolos, des bolos, des euros
J'connais un mec à qui la mettre au casse-pipe
Même pour un dolo, tarot, barrette sur barrette dans l'créneau
Ça craint, dans l'coffre ou sous l'capot
Sur le carreau les mecs finissent défigurés, parole de salaud
Personne parle au sens figuré, hein Demon?

Moi j'suis pas posé dans le living-room, j'suis recherché par le shérif du comté
Vas-y Rim'k roule T'inquiètes poto, j'bombarde, j'suis actif
J'ai un œil sur l'rétro et un autre sur le spliff
Tiens, tu veux fumer poto?
Non, pas trop après le coup quand on aura des sous
Quand on sera avec des fouffes en caleçons et qu'on sera saouls
J'ai trouvé une petite baraque pépère aménagée à ma façon
Pas un truc de crasseux, y'a de quoi tenir 3 saisons
Et gros, y'a combien de mecs qui savent on est où?
Y'en a qu'un, un ami à toi? Non, un ami à nous
Papou c'est bon, y'a plus qu'à attendre les hommes de main
Dès qu'AP ramène les thunes, j'enterre les sacs dans le jardin

« Ça devient trop complexe là, j'ai été obligé de jeter le sac
De donner le blé aux gros bonnets, là d'où tu sais
J'suis filoche, faut que j'éteins mon portable et RDV où tu sais »

J'suis paro, j'marche en solo et j'porte un blazer
Démarche de bonhomme, moi j'm'affiche pas comme Sauzé Kaiser
J'récupère le sac il était pas loin de 19 heures
L'heure tourne poto pour tout ça j'ai qu'1/4 d'heure
Pour pas qu'j'me fasse péter, j'me fond dans la masse
En plus j'suis un peu pété mais faut que j'laisse aucune trace
J'ai des clés dans une consigne à la gare j'suis rusé
Faut qu'j'récupère une voiture banalisée, bien organisé
Tellement de choses à ne pas dire que ma mémoire est pleine
Tellement voulu oublier que j'en ai perdu le code P.I.N
La fin de mon parcours je vous la raconte pas, les balances tu sais comment c'est
J'dois vous laisser, tracer ma route car j'suis filoché

« On pensait qu'ça allait foirer, mais heureusement qu'il y avait les 2 comoriens là
Les 2 comoriens qu'étaient là pour rattraper le coup
C'est les gars qu'il fallait pour ce boulot de toutes façons
Allez, à plus tard »

J'récupère OGB sur ma bécane de sport
On m'paye pour gêner les porcs, j'ai tous les passeports
Après notre diversion, direction l'aéroport
On va pas te raconter 10 versions, personne n'est mort
Toujours calme, jamais en sueur même affolé
Le temps qu'ils élucident notre manège qu'on a décollé
Notre histoire s'évapore sous un soleil orangé
Tous postichais à bord, on compte tous se ranger
On s'est fait la malle, comment on leur a fait mal mais restons sur nos gardes
En cas de mandat international et que tout le monde ferme sa gueule
Ou tu finis comme Bennie Seagle Hôtesse, un whisky, on est des pros de Mayer Landski
Même les ritals s'demandent c'est qui
C'est la Mafia K'1 Fry, d'Orly, Choisy, Vitry
Que personne touche à la came on va s'auto-niquer
Qu'on prospère notre filière dans l'pétrole, les chaînes hôtelières
On a fait le coup du siècle, on a exaucé notre rêve
On parle toujours la main devant la bouche pour pas qu'on lise sur nos lèvres

« Tant mieux, dans c'boulot la devise c'est vite, bien et sans bavure
Et surtout toujours penser à effacer les preuves",Story Mafia,2003
Mafia K'1 Fry,"On l'a pas souhaité, on l'a pas voulu
Après nous avoir pillé, la France continue à nous humilier
Discriminations sociales, raciales
Inégalités économiques, répressions
Ouais la France nous mets la pression

On veut pas s'laisser faire, on veut notre part et du respect

Depuis qu'y'a l'euro, on souffre, c'est la guerre
La France est au bord du gouffre, c'est la guerre
Y'a plus d'thunes, nul part, c'est ouf, c'est la guerre
Bien sur c'est aux plus pauvres qu'ils ont déclaré la guerre
Rabzas ou renois, on sert de boucs émissaires
Ils n'ont qu'deux projets pour nous : prison et misère
Si tu veux des sous et du respect, fais la guerre
J'ai beau aimer la paix, mais j'peux pas nier qu'c'est la guerre!

Huit Mesures (?), mon frère, c'est la guerre
Comment réussir à s'en sortir avec un p'tit salaire
T'as toujours l'impression de marcher les couilles et le cul à l'air
Sa mère, c'est l'champ d'bataille sur l'ter-ter
Unités, char d'assaut, tanks, hélicoptères
L'état nous met un max de pression, mais on lâchera pas l'affaire
Car j'ai trop mangé la gamelle, côtoyé la misère
Le seum se libère quand les menottes se resserrent

La guérilla urbaine pour mes barillas
Guerrier 9.4, toujours en série A
Cruels sur nos ruelles, nos keufs, nos politiques que cherche le duel
Juste des larmes et des corps au bout du tunnel
Des halls s'enflamment en banlieue, en haut lieu
Ça s'liquide dans le milieu
Ca tranche dans les zones franches, ca en devient périlleux
J'm'entends même plus crier, ça tire, tous se déchirent dans ce brouhaha
Tellement de faits d'armes et d'faits divers dans tout nos trous à rats

On l'a pas souhaité, mais c'est la guerre

Issus de la classe ouvrière, on a les armes pour faire la guerre
J'me rapproche de la trentaine et toujours là sur le ter-ter
Mafia K'1 Fry, Black Panthers, 40 ans après c'est la même
Levez vos flingues, serrez vos poings, visez la tête si nécessaire
Que celui qui veut la paix prépare la guerre, croise le fer
Je démarre tellement vite, qu'évite de regarder de travers
Alors je m'habille treillis kaki avec une capuche sur la tête
On tire en l'air pour faire la fête, on tire sur toi pour faire la guerre

C'est la guerre, dans les rues les jeunes charbonnent
Pour un regard, ça s'cogne, corps à corps entre nous et les forces de l'ordre
C'est la guerre, y'a des pules-cra, des seuses-cra, et des cistes-ra
Dehors c'est la jungle, ça hésite pas gros
C'est la guerre, l'Etat nous donne des restes depuis tout petit
On mange des miettes, on a tant d'donnes mec, frotter dans l'assiette
C'est la guerre, on est souvent sur les nerfs, décidés, armés
A l'aube combien se lèvent pour aller jobber?

Dans c'monde d'opportunistes, Mafia K'1 Fry résiste
Hardcore pour qu'on existe, encore vivants, trop d'racistes
C'est la guerre, faut qu'on s'unisse, surtout pas qu'on se divise
C'est la guerre dans nos rues, jusqu'à l'industrie du disque
C'est la guerre du plus gros biff pour la mif', faut qu'on s'en sorte mec
J'suis resté authentique, j'veux qu'le fric frappe à ma porte mec
C'est la guerre, j'baisse pas mon treillis, mon quotidien n'est pas fashion
Sois déterminé, sois brave, ta gueule, mon pote réaction

Demande au maire, d'Choisy-Le-Roi qu'est-ce qu'il a fait pour sa jeunesse?
C'est l'insurgé K'1 Fry du mois, si l'chômage est à la baisse
C'est la guerre, dans nos ghettos l'Etat nous a délaissé
S'en battent les couilles d'la situation, au Karsher ils veulent nous débarrasser
Même en GAV c'est la guerre, entre Chiraquiens et Sarkozistes
Baise leurs discriminations positives, leurs lois racistes
Ne parle pas d'intégration, viens dans nos banlieues c'est la guerre
Rappelle toi des émeutes, demain ça sera pire qu'hier

C'est la guerre, voilà comment on débarque nous

On représente toutes les familles nombreuses élevées par une femme sans homme
J'réponds à l'appel, j'ai la haine
Ils m'ont coupés les vivres, c'est ma raison d'être
Cette guerre c'est ma raison d'vivre, rien dans l'bide, c'est sec
Et les soucis nous creusent tous la tête, ici tout s'achète
Marre des dettes, TVA, impôts, taxes c'est la guerre

C'est la guerre, 3andek la policia yshoufek 40 degrés, cul sec

I been checking you out right, what
You can't tell, check this out then
This what I want to tell you right here

[Chorus: A3 and Noke D]
Hey there shorty, can I get with you
Because we came here to party, and do what playas do
I've been peeping you all night, your booty's feeling right
I ain't trying to be your man, cause a playa's down to understand

[Mafia Mike]
Baby I been peeping you, for a real hot second
I know you got a man, and I trying to disrespect him
But check it, I get the message when you tell me that you need him
But baby, I ain't trying to change your lifestyle either
Your people steady telling you, to leave dude alone
But it's hard, you just pictured a new car and a home
A new phone to talk on, when you ride down the street
Your hair stay fixed, manicures smelling sweet
To me, all that beauty poo I know that you sick
It's the small things that count, and that's what you miss
I came back to get a kiss, and to tell you good night
And to really show you, that's it's goin' be alright
Kinda like Prada hot, to set the mood straight
Baby I'm your cow, goin' taking you away
Ok, go on ahead and lay your head on my chest
I know that's what you want, that mean you through with all the stress
I confess

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Shorty I've been watching you
Can you be my baby boo
We can bang Screw, all night
Floss in my Navigator, on chrome
Let me show you around my hood
Where the block stay hot, and it's all good
I'ma flip it, like a real playa should
I can't explain, what's understood
Understand, you can't be my wife
Cause I'm still young, trying to live my life
See things, that I ain't seen
I'm on a mission, trying to live my dream
We can chill, anywhere today
If it's real then it's real, baby girl why wait
My partner needs me, I ain't got time to play
I'll do anything you want, just say

[Chorus]

[Tyte Eyez]
Peep game, I ain't the one to jump fly
But since I stepped through the do', you been giving me the eye
I'm trying to figure out why, a girl so thoed
Want to mess with a nigga, that'll dig in her soul
I'm in control, let's keep it on the low
Watching your g-string, move across the dance flo'
While Moe over fo', screwed up moving slow
Only pulling bad hoes, that's down for losing clothes
I suppose, one I get up in your mind
Two, lay down then get up in your spine
Three, that's me a bonefied G
I smash and then free, that's the taste of a ski I-P
Are-O miss, to lace your bubble bath, in Don P and Cris
Watch us made that switch, but I'm far from a trick
I just like to make your wish, to live like this cause I'ma player

Get that ak slug through your vest
Forget your dog, get bucked
Wind up and see you with all the garbage stuck
Now you in the depths of Hell, feel like damn it ain't my lucky day
Never shoulda looked my way, motherfucker
Don't trust your bitch ass fool as far as I can thrust ya
Don't make no sudden moves fool and I won't have to bust ya

Yo dog I hope you cleaned your strap
""Uh huh, 'cause I puts in work""

Fatal how the hood'll hate you, caught up in drama
Colors and ganja like black autototes for armor
Millies and macks never the same pocket
Kept his phillies and crack how the streets rock it
Switch em, b cases like he fathered the system
Organized block cinemas away from the prison
With souls, lost rows and so on
Fall victim to the streets and so much can go wrong
Rebels meet crumble and majesties for salaries
Out of towners and goose downers introduce pounders
A lay loot for power evil roots shoot through cowards
Lettin other niggas just regulate they hours
Coke or chronic, philly roll millie by his scrotum
Barrel x to g packs
Never got along with cops, like it was Brett Favre and D backs
It's how rap cats believe that
""Just puttin in work""
And it's on like that
Castro, you know it's on like that
""Huh huh huh huuuh work""
And it's on like that
Yeah y'all we gettin it on like that
""Puttin it in y'all, puttin it in y'all""

Check it, I get deep voice like Barry

Forgot I got permit to carry
All you sleep
Look at me, his face I'll bury
I look at you and say that's what happens when cousins marry
""Work""
Hate that funk shit, don't show up
Tore up from the floor up
My gat's so fat it needs to loose weight like hold up
On the run huh, it might be bailin in a Bronco
I be layin low from Rocko
In a condo outside of Toronto
How I feel about y'all poppin shit
Like a constipated port a lot of noise but you ain't droppin shit
This is me here, it ain't no other man
Always into somebody's business like you was

Nigga I puts in like ten men
Kick up more dust than dirt
Drinkin more gin than Vin

Couldn't drop up on me so we got to fuck over Tommy

Je suis souple et mince et je glisse
Entre les mains de la police
Pour moi tous les gens sont pareils
C'est du fric et des po-ches
Bouclez bien vos grilles
Chacun m'appelle ""l'anguille""

Parmi la foule
Je me déroule
Et je ramasse

Que je recueille
Dans ma vieille paillasse
Je sais que c'est un paradoxe
Tant pis si c'est pas orthodoxe
Malgré mon surnom de poisson
Je m'en vais à la pêche

Planquez vot' jonquille
Voici venir l'anguille !

J'ai beau être un vrai spécialiste
Pour moi y a pas que'le fric qu'existe
Il faut que j'l'avoue j'ai du goût
Pour les brunes et les blondes
Un regard qui brille...
Aussitôt je frétille...

Les sous du voisin me passionnent
Mais le coeur d'une jolie personne
C'est l'coffre fort le plus fort
Qu'on puisse trouver au monde
Ca tient d'la Bastille
Mais on m'appelle l'anguille

Sur la promenade
Je me balade
repère
une coquine
à la taille fine
Une sacrée bergère
Je lui fais comprendre en souplesse
Que son caractère m'intéresse
Et quand elle mord à l'amorce
En douceur je la fer-re

Planquez-vous les filles !

L'amour traîne, au coin de chaque rue
L'amour passe, ne l'avez-vous pas vu
Le voici qui s'envole,
Dans une danse folle
Oh, l'amour, je veux vous suivre.
Il se moque, et fait des pieds de nez
Il vous croque, et rit de vous croquer
Il vous accroche au coeur

Oh l'amour est un farceur.
Où est-il, est-ce dans vos yeux
Qu'il me fait un petit signe
Tire-t'il d'un air malicieux

Venez ma joie mon âme
Venez ma belle flamme
Oh l'amour que je vous aime.

Où l'amour est le roi
Jamais ne s'arrêtera.

Et vos lèvres ont le goût du jasmin
Et vos mains serrent mes mains.

Here's my captain now relax, let him do what he do
Okay, who rolling spinach? cause I'm reeling the anchor
Smoke up up an acre a grass wake up in Jamaica
Couple nautical miles, I call my cubanos to cop
Puerto Rico for women, hit Barbados to shop
Living larger than life call this the yacht club
Before ya join us bitch ya gotta get your stax up
Shes walking back and forth, shes just itchen to fuck
And then I heard her whisper: ""Girl you know he 's rich as fuck""

Man overboard cause hes goin overboard

Put up in Costa Rica, I get the most of features
She no speakay no englay, maybe Fat Joe could teach her
Smoking barrels of reefer, only the yacht club

Her head above average, my head above water

Im in ta fine fish with a slight lime twist
Veggies on the side of course, kush appetizez
Let your Mercedes chill, roll wit a navy seal
This the yacht club, wanna trust me your lady will,
Still spillen champagne, or is it merlow
Fuck it its fine wine, my bitch a vergo
I don't do the signs, unless there dollars on em
I'm the boss a theboat, cashmere collar on em,
Thinking a last year and all the moneys made
Now its corporate invest in, and amongst the other things
No one agrees with me, but that's just how it goes
