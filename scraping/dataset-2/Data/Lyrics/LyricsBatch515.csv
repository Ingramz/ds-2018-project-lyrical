Julia DeMato,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last,2003
Julia DeMato,"If tomorrow all the things were gone, I worked for all my life
And I had to start again with just my children and my wife
I’d thank my lucky stars to be livin' here today
‘Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can’t take that away

And I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free
And I won't forget the ones who died, who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
‘Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U.S.A.

From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say

That I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free
And I won't forget the ones who died, who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
‘Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U.S.A.

I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free

Julia Dollison,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

And good enough for the whole world to hear
Sweeter than honey and beneath the blood

To soothe away all your doubts and your fears
From every angle within and above

When promises are never broken I'll know
When every last word has been spoken I'll know
When every last deed isn't token I'll know

If I could have a pound for every moment I've spent worrying
On all the little things in life that frankly there's no hurrying
Then I would be a rich girl I wanna be a rich girl soon
But going at this rate I think that it might take
Till there's life on the moon...

Where does the time go? Does anyone know?
Where does the time go? Does anyone know?
Where does the time go? Does anyone know?

If I could have a sneak preview to all the earthly reasons
It takes to make the theme of time then I'd be a girl for all seasons
And I wouldn't have to worry I wouldn't have to worry oh no no no
It just seems kind of funny that there's some things I'll just never
Know

Like where does the time go? Does anyone know?
Where does the time go? Does anyone know?
Where does the time go? Does anyone know?

We were only just saying just the other day
How it's really amazing how the days just seem to slip away
And it's right before my very own eyes
Oh there's some things that we'll never, we'll never know, like

Where does the time go?
Where does the time go? Does anyone know?
Tell me where does the time go?
Tell me where does it go?
There's some things we'll never know

If I could have a pound for every moment I've spent worrying
On all the little things in life that frankly there's no hurrying

Oh where does the time go? Does anyone know?

Oh tell me where does the time go?

Where does the time go?

I've been counting all my days, I've been counting all my nights
Tell me where does it go?
Where, where, where, where, where does it go?

Are you meaning to tell me that you still love me too?

I need, I need another good friend
Like I need, like I need a hole in my head.
And I want, I want, I want your loving in my heart
And I want, and I want, I want your loving in my bed...

Oh did I happen, did I happen, did I happen to mention?

She happened to mention you'd said that we were through

Julia Fordham,"I cried the Solent, the Tyne, the Severn and the Rhine
The Thames and the Seine over again
But

I won't be crying anymore, a lake of tears like I shed
Before
For you, only for you

The Ganges, the Clyde, the Amazon, the Nile
The Avon, the Trent, the tears that I spent!
But

I won't be crying anymore, all these tears like I shed
Before
For you, only for you

A sea of love runs deep in these veins
Flooding my heart with anger and pain
The depth of reason, a wave of regret
But the times that we had I'll never forget

But I won't be crying anymore, all these tears
Like I shed before, for you, only for you,
Only for you, only for you, only...

Julia Fordham,"Island...

If you make yourself an island, I'm gonna sail straight out to you
If you burn your bridges one by one, I'll not give up on you.
But if you scratch, scratch the surface, underneath the skin
Under the armour of that iron woman
So many things lie within...

So don't you test my love like you test the love of your boyfriends
Oh don't you know the love for a woman, for a woman, for a woman
Is there to the end, there to the end...?

I know you're feeling bitter and twisted, I've seen it
Seeping out of every pore
Rising up beyond the goodness of a perfect human core
And if you peel, peel away the wisdom, underneath the skin
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what lies within...

Oh don't you lose my love, oh don't you lose your love my friend
Oh don't you know the love for a woman, for a woman
Is there to the end, there to the end?

I just wanted to say you know I love you...

If you bite, bite the hand that feeds you, don't think he'll
Keep coming back for more
'Cause this is real life not the movies girl, I've told you that before
But if you scrape, scrape at the bravado, underneath the skin
Under the armour of everybody, so many things lie hidden...

So don't you, don't you, don't you doubt my love
Like you doubt the love of all your friends
Oh don't you know the love for a woman (repeat 11 times)
Is there to the end, there to the end?

You make me feel like a teenager dressed in a woman's clothes
And I ask you, and I ask you, where do we go from here?

All my life, I've been the one who's big and strong for everyone
Then you come along, a towerblock for me to lean on.
And I ask you, where do we go from here?

You've got me so I'm curling like a kitten in your hand
You've got me so I'm clawing like a tiger caged and bound
And I ask you, and I ask you, where do we go from here?

All my life, I've been the one who's big and strong for everyone
Then you come along, a towerblock for me to lean on.
And I ask you, where do we go from here?

Julia Fordham,"Your lovely face, your lovely face, your lovely...

I'm standing in my kitchen, I'm driving in my car
Lying on my bed in my room wondering where you are
I keep meaning to call you, but I never find the time
Doesn't mean to say that you're not weaving through my mind!

What I wouldn't do right now to see your lovely face
What I wouldn't do right now to see your lovely face
What I wouldn't do right now to fill in all this space
That I've gone and built just for myself.

Sitting in this restaurant, I'm running 'round some park
Swimming in some clear blue water wondering where you are
I keep meaning to tell you that things aren't what they seem
Doesn't mean that you're not weaving through my dreams!

What I wouldn't do, what I wouldn't do,
What I wouldn't do right now to see your lovely face...

Your lovely face, your lovely face, your lovely
Your lovely face, your lovely, your lovely face

Smiling on the ocean, I'm flying through the air
You know I'm travelling so much travelling these days
Then what should I, should I care?
Finally arriving where I was born to be
Doesn't mean to say your lovely face can't be with me...

A shot at happiness

That old devil is calling
Alarm bell light is on
Standby in my busy head
In case I might be wrong

And I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I?
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I?

I pinch myself I'm dreaming
Too good to be true
That I'm the girl with everything
And everything to lose

And I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I?
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I?

I'm looking out for something
I might have missed
Who knows what it is?
The honeymoon, the honeymoon
The honeymoon is over

I heed the voice of reason
Like you're supposed to do
And looking down on everything
I still came back to you

And I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I?
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I?

You see what I've come to? I really should know better

But I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you
I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you

I lie awake at night to savour every moment I've stolen

But I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you
I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)

And the funny part is I feel no guilt and no shame
And I guess where there's no action there's no blame
And if I had an ounce of sense left I'd keep it that way too
And I think of you, I think of me
And remember what will be will be
And I'm looking forward to the day
Where I don't have to feel this way

And I've been licking brand new wounds
And tending old scars

The one that started

Going strong, holding on

I've been east, I've been west
But I'm still not over you yet
I'm still not over you yet, no no
The weeks and months blend into one
A bleary haze, fall, winter
Now spring has begun
Bringing fresh hope to my door
I'll be the girl I was before you took back
The precious gift you gave to me
Going strong, holding on
Trying to find a place where I belong
I've been east, I've been west
But I'm still not over you yet

I confess, there's a chance
I cannot fake it any longer
I admit, this could be it
There's a danger I'm going under
I know that yesterday
You saw me stronger than the sun
Then one cold word from you
And swiftly I've come undone

And your love's killing me slowly
Killing me one day at a time
Killing me slowly
It's the sweetest suicide
It's the sweetest suicide

Killing me slowly

Your firm hand on the door
My brave little foot keeping it open
My whole self on the line
There's a danger I might get broken
Slip your pill under my tongue
And willingly I succumb
Cup my heart in your palm
And squeeze it 'til the red stuff runs

And your love's killing me slowly
Killing me one day at a time
Killing me slowly
It's the sweetest suicide
It's the sweetest suicide

Killing me slowly

For a moment there
You know I almost fooled myself
Into thinking I was in control of how I felt
Striving towards salvation
Clutching my last drop of dignity
Go on take the pillow
Smother me, smother me

And your love's killing me slowly
Killing me one day at a time
Killing me slowly
It's the sweetest suicide
It's the sweetest suicide

There's a new girl hanging out with you
I'd kill the messenger
But she's my friend and I love her
And I know she tells me this for my own good

Now she's lying in my place
With the right to kiss my favourite face
Now she's curled up in my chair
Your fingers in her hair

I do the best I can
To go along with God's good plan
He thinks it's obvious
There's no hope for the two of us
So I know he's doing this for my own good

Take me to the sea

And I'll try not to be me

With my don'ts and dos
You be kind and wonderful
And I'll be good to you

Stay, stay, stay, stay

Safe beneath these clean white sheets I dream
I'm under you over you outside you
I have been happy in my dreaming

Kiss me in the morning
Hold me though the night
Whisper that it's okay
And I'll believe you're right
Steer me from the shadows
Lead me to the light
Push your hand in my hand
And I won't put up a fight

I'd cross the deepest ocean
I'd hold my breath
And I would swim against the tide

Love love love
In my bed
On my phone
In my house
When I get home
That is where I want to find you

From your camp there's not a single word

I might have to prove them wrong
As the cracks begin to show
I'm trying to find the strength 
To let you go

Hope turned out to be 
A dangerous lesson
Faith a shallow river in disguise
Running through my patient spirit
Drowning my pride

Julia Fordham,"From the south side of Chicago
On Woodland Avenue
The youngest of eight children
With a voice that soared and soothed
Singing at the Lincoln Center
The church a block away
Like a perfect angel
As the Red Sanders Band played

She said, ""Baby
Can we just go some place warm
And stay there ?til the baby's born?
I'll be your roadside angel
And walk with you through life""

She was his roadside angel
He was her guiding light
They drove south from New York city
To Gainesville, Florida
And settled for two summers
There with Marc and Maya

Chorus

He loved her from the moment he saw her
At the top of the electric theatre stairs
Wrapped in his loving arms she lay
Listening to Stevie she flew away
She flew away

I want to get laid
I want to lay down

Just passing me by

I want to fly like a bird
I want to sing and be heard
I want a room with a view
I want to wake up with you
I want to believe 
And I want to have faith
I want to walk round
In a sweet state of grace
Forever

I want to be normal
I want to fit in
I want to fit perfectly

In these days of wonder

Ties me to you
Like a magical infallible cable
Stretching over mountains
Across the sea
Every star lights the path to you from me
Under deserts
Through the barren plains 
Connecting you to me again
An emotional devotional bond
Binds me to you
An electrical undetectable current
Charging over mountains
Across the sea
Every star lights the path to you from me
Under deserts
Through the barren planes
Connecting you to me again
No matter where you are
No matter no matter how far
Over mountains

My rose tinted glasses are incredible
Blinding me to the inevitable
Coloring my judgment like a jumbo pack of pens
Like the ones you buy for birthday's
For children of your friends

My inner guide was screaming look out beware
I silenced Miss Righteous with one stony glare
Figuring what would she know anyway
Yet thanks to her I'm standing her
Defiantly today

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

My white flag was flying in the wind
Though you had no heard for surrendering
On we marched regardless for reason's still unknown
Sometimes the wrong thing
Seems so much better than being alone

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

Is this a good time to mention
Some where contemplating
An earthly intervention
We're all blessed with 20/20 hindsight
You're just another thing
I didn't quite get it right

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me



",Guilty,2004
Julia Fordham,"(Julia Fordham/David Ricketts)

Thanks for being soft and kind
For making me change my mind
About everyone and everything
Boxed in this corner of mine
You walked across my borderline
And reached the girl that used to be me

When I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Avoiding any fire and smoke
Safety first is all she wrote
Barricading up the open doors
Headed for the comfort zone
And settled for a life alone
Looking back locked in the ivory tower

To when I'd jump in
Not wondering if I would sink or swim
When I would dare
To move an inch without a single care

Before I invented
Perfect me
Perfect me
Perfect me

Thanks for being sweet and strong
For making me feel I belong
To the land of the living

Like when I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Before I invented
Perfect me
Perfect me
Perfect me

Maybe someday you'll bring me a beer

And here's to bartenders tryin' to get paid
When all of us are tryin' to get

I'm re-reading your letters
And watching them burn (burn)

I'm watching them burn (burn)

You published the letters she wrote to you
You told the whole world
How you brought this girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives

How they fall for your charms
All your charms

I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart
You have thrown it all away
Stand back, watch it burn
Just watch it all burn

And when the time comes

Explain to the children

The pain and embarrassment

You put their mother through

When will you learn

That they are your legacy?
We are your legacy

To translate my heart and my vision
To my beloved and his children
To all who come to sit at our table
Or walk with us through the market place
Or pray with us by the water

May I have the plain poetry to tell them how I feel
Or why there is pain,
If the answers are mine to know.
And if they are, I ask the Spirit to let me share them
With a light heart, with laughter,
Wth no expectation, with humility
But for the grace of Thee, go I.
May I know my innocence
Every moment of every day
May I be a child forever
Intoxicated by hot sand, cool winds, by love
By my own communication to the Spirit.
May my aliveness always be as loud
When I make love, as when I cry
May I see my own reflection in the mirror
And smile

Who would change the course of my dreams?

Watching older dreams grow dim.
Oh, what a melancholy choice this is,
Wanting home, wanting him.
Closing my heart to every hope but his,
Leaving the home I love.

I must go. I must go.

The clocks shatter I scatter the jock horde and splatter the chalkboard
it matters a lot more, than half of you thought
When you were knocking me like I'm a laughingstock
and a weakling a freak and creep, I was mocked and ignored
You're sorry now but talk is cheap, shoulda thought it before
You're the sorry flock of sheep who made me rot to core

we're gonna bring you a segment live from her hospital bed!
we'll try to bring you the spin through your preexisting opinions

of course we know this situation is tragic

so like us, vine us, and tweet to connect
24/7 we're giving ya what you're craving
we live to deliver live the kinda coverage you've come to expect
we're always here for you

We come together in this hour of need
to the honor the innocent victims of this cowardly deed
of course I share your sentiment as your voice in the senate
but let's accept nothing ever could have been done to prevent it
it's just the strange inner visions of a deranged individual
full of rage, full of hate, full of vitriol
But I gotta mention that it's sick and insane
my opponent's twisting your pain for political gain
that's lame
and I think it's a damn shame
it doesn't give anyone power to cast blame
because the past is past, and it's best that we keep things the same

Fill your bags up at Macy's, and chat in the hall

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

En su cuarto sin error
Huyendo de aquel teniente
Al mando del pelotón
Lo que no sabían los guachos
Es que el viejo era cabrón

Paulino sembraba mota
En el barranco del cerro
Pero no se imaginaba que
Alguien le pusiera el dedo
por eso los federales
Lo traían al puro pedo

Les preparo la emboscada
A la orilla del camino
Se puso dos peri-casos
También un trago de vino
Van ha saber estos votas
Quien es el viejo Paulino

(Y arriba barrí maraña)

Se oye el trote de caballos
Por el cañón del olivo
Paulino se la jugaba
Y siempre salia vivo
Nomas jalo el llamador
De su fiel cuerno de chivo

No más me falta el soplón
Para acabar de vengarme
Según mi punto de vista
Se me hace que es mi compadre
Voy a buscarlo a su rancho
Para partirlo su madre

Talk about what we're doing; what this is
The way it's going right now, I
I'm going crazy

Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?
Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?

To maintain, that's the price of fame
Walked in, lights dim, never knowing my name
Now it's sold-out shows, they try expose what I made
You a fake-ass rapper, you a hoe in a lane
And I made this life from picking holes in my brain
I was born with a vision, Alexander the Great
And that fake love creeping like the cancer I born
June 27th, 1993, I came on
With them black fists high and them blisters in it
Black boy, white friends, he don't know different
Days spent scrubbing on his face in the mirror
My blood bleed red so why them homeboys whisper?
Cold nights and dead friends, man, I still get shivers
I still wet the bed, I remember being with you
I see vividness in places I go
I see dead bodies flying of the ones that cut short
And these dreams that I'm living only present to crawl
And I love you, my nigga, but I'm doing the most

Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?
Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?

Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?
Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?",Pink Flower,2017

Nessun dorma!
Tu pure, o principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
D'amore e di speranza!

Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun saprà!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Il nome suo nessun saprà

Julian Byron,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

The more I see you as years go by

Julian Casablancas,"I'll just nod, I've never been so good at shaking hands
I live on the frozen surface of a fireball
Where cities come together to hate each other in the name of sport
America, nothing is ever just anything
I looked up to you, but you thought I would look the other way

And you hear what you want to hear
And they take what they want to take

Don't be sad, won't ever happen like this anymore
So when's it coming, this last new great movement that I can join?
It won't end here, your faith has got to be greater than your fear

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting
You are looking for your own voice but in others
While it hears you, trapped in another dimension

Drop your guard, you don't have to be smart all of the time
I've got a mind full of blanks, I need to go somewhere new fast
And don't be shy, oh no, at least deliberately
'Cause no one really cares or wonders why anymore
Oh, I got music, coming out of my hands and feet and kisses

That is how it once was done
All the dreamers on the run

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting
We're so quick to point out our own flaws in others
Complicated mammals on the wings of robots

But don't you dare get to the top and not know what to do",11th Dimension,2009
Julian Casablancas,"I hear it in your silence,
When you don't speak
Well what's funny then,
Isn't funny anymore.

I can hear it in your voice,
There's always a catch
We're going nowhere,
And we're going there fast.

Anything to watch
While we are waiting
For this apocalypse?
What more is there to do?

It's nice to be important
But so close to being despised
It's more important to be nice
I guess than being wise

I'll take you shopping
I take you dancing too
I take you out
All the thing you wanna do
And I'll give you diamonds
And I'll give you space
So be with anyone you want
It's alright with me.

Oh time is over
Don't you know that
If a time won't
Pause or burn
I'll stay right in my place
Now worry's over!

I hear it in your silence,
When you don't speak
There is a quiet, cryin' rage
Burning inside you, so deep.

I'd give you anything
But I'd give you problems
So be with anyone you want
It's alright with me.

I hear it in your voice
I see it in your lips
There's always a catch
I guess that's alright with me

When no one's around
'Cause the map says you're here
Now I can hear a loneliness
Screaming in my ear.

Oh, time is over
Don't you know that
If a time won't pause or burn
I stay right in my place

As your life in corruption and temper in the way

And the ones who deserved it, they'll never understand it.

Somewhere along the way, that excitement turned to pleasure

Mothers crying at the airport

With canals and a freezing swamp. He climbs high up above the countryside

North he could just make out the ruins of the priory where Joss and I
Played cricket as children. We were only three miles away, probably drinking
Tea and talking,

At the same time as he was taking the stanley knife out of

Through. And then he reached down, and he took the bag.

Julian Cope,"Easy when life's a bitter pill
You swallow down with your last breath

And find me alone
And trapped amidst superlatives and greed
Shine underneath

I was thrown out of the crib into the snow
I was born to entertain, so here I go

Not easy but your hands around my neck
Could be construed as your being rude

Find the dinner gong, put down my fork
Start my song
Cause I could be anything you want me to be

Top or bottom face the monster let him know
I was born to entertain so here go
Top or bottom face the monster let him know

Ça fait longtemps que je n´y étais pas venu
Il y a des enfants qui courent et des feuilles qui tombent
Il y a des étudiants qui rêvent qu´ils ont fini leurs études
Et des professeurs qui rêvent qu´ils les commencent
Il y a des amoureux qui remontent discrètement
Le tapis roux que l´automne a déroulé devant eux
Et puis il y a moi, je suis seul, j´ai un peu froid

Encore un jour sans amour
Encore un jour de ma vie
Le Luxembourg a vieilli
Est-ce que c´est lui?
Est-ce que c´est moi?
Je ne sais pas

Encore un jour sans soleil
Encore un jour qui s´enfuit
Vers le sommeil, vers l´oubli
Une étincelle évanouie

Là où cet enfant passe, je suis passé
Il suit un peu la trace que j´ai laissée
Mes bateaux jouent encore sur le bassin
Si les années sont mortes
Les souvenirs se portent bien

Encore un jour sans amour
Encore un jour de la vie
Un jour de pluie qui s´en va
Un jour de pluie loin de toi

Tu me disais que tu m´aimais
Je te croyais, tu me mentais
C´était trop beau pour être bien
Je suis partie chercher plus loin

Je te disais que je t´aimais
Et j´y croyais et c´était vrai
Tu étais tout, tout est fini
Tu es partie, tu es partout

Je vais comme elle vient
Mais si tu m´appelais
Tu verrais comme rien ne change

Viens, viens n´importe quand
Je t´attends ma dernière chance

Je voulais réussir dans ma vie
Et j´ai tout réussi, sauf ma vie
J´avais en moi un grain de folie
Qui n´a pas poussé, qui n´a pas pris
Dis-moi, c´que j´ai fait de ma vie
Dis-moi, c´que j´ai fait de ta vie

Je voulais que tu vives ma vie
Et toi, tu voulais vivre ta vie
J´avais en moi un grain de beauté
Que j´ai laissé germer à côté

Encore un jour de la vie
Un jour de pluie qui s´en va

L´éternité pour un jour
Je donne tout pour un rien
Pour te revoir faire un détour
Par le jardin du Luxembourg

Toute une vie pour ta vie
L´éternité pour un jour
Pour un sourire, un regard
Pour le délire d´un espoir

Je vais courir le monde pour te trouver
Je vais briser la glace qui nous sépare

Julian Dash,"Après bien des années de travaux souterrains
Et désintéressés DELANOË et DASSIN
Ont trouvé par hasard une chanson en or
D’un poète inconnu, musique du folklore
Voici le document authentique et complet
Il est intitulé « BILLY LE BORDELAIS »

Dès sa naissance
C'est fou quand on y pense
Avec violence
Il repoussa le lait
Que sa nourrice
Une fille sans malice
Venue de Suisse
Gentiment lui donnait

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
À condition d'en mettre dans les biberons
C'était un bébé ni beau, ni laid
Avec des petits mollets
Mais déjà le monde l'appelait
Billy le Bordelais (qui?)
Billy le Bordelais

L'enfant terrible
Avait l'horreur morbide
De ce liquide
Que l'on appelle de l'eau
La plus mauvaise
Etant la flotte anglaise
Billy à l'aise
Nous vengea de Waterloo

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
Ah qu'il était content le Napoléon
Il dit à Billy ""Toi tu me plais
Pour tout ce que tu as fait
Moi je te donne la Bourgogne""
Billy le Bordelais (qui ça?)
Billy le Bordelais

De la Castille
À la mer des Antilles
Toutes les filles
De Billy raffolaient
Des Messalines
Des reines et des tsarines
Des Ursulines
Tout le monde y passait

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
Pour trousser les jupons et les cotillons
Avec tous les enfants qu'il a fait
Je me demande si tu n'es
Ou si je ne suis pas bâtard de
Billy le Bordelais (qui?)
Billy le Bordelais

Messieurs, Mesdames
Voici la fin du drame
L'adieu aux armes
Laissez vos larmes couler
Billy l'unique
Billy le magnifique
C'est historique
Est mort assassiné

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
Mais l'ennemi guettait le pauvre garçon
On lui a glissé dedans son verre
De l'eau à dose mortelle
Il est mort dans un dernier glou-glou

Billy le Bordelou (qui?)
Billy le Bordeli (non!)
Billy le Bordelon (c'est vrai?)
Billy le Bordelais

Prince, Duc ou Marquis
Ou Monsieur de Bordeaux

Espérant que demain, toi aussi tu la chantes",Billy le Bordelais,2003

Il n´avait jamais connu ni patrie, ni patron
Il venait de n´importe où, allait aux quatre vents
Mais dedans sa roulotte nous étions dix enfants
Et le soir, autour d´un feu de camp
On rêvait d´une maison blanche en chantant

Qu´il est long, qu´il est loin, ton chemin, papa
C´est vraiment fatigant d´aller où tu vas
Qu´il est long, qu´il est loin, ton chemin, papa
Tu devrais t´arrêter dans ce coin

Mais il ne nous écoutait pas et dès le petit jour
La famille reprenait son voyage au long cours

Et nous voilà repartis pour une nouvelle Terre Promise

Et c´est ainsi que cahotant à travers les saisons
C´est ainsi que regardant par-dessus l´horizon
Sans même s´en apercevoir notre père nous a semés
Aux quatre coins du monde comme des grains de blé
Et quelque part au bout de l´univers
Roule encore la vieille roulotte de mon père

Ancient footprints are everywhere.
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.

Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Where I've got me a date with pretty little girl from Greece
She promised she'd be there with me
When I paint my masterpiece.

Oh, the hours we've spent inside the Coliseum,
Dodging lions and wastin' time.
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em,
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.

Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece.

Sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola.
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!

Well I left Rome and landed in Brussels,
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried.
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside.

Had to be held down by big police.
But someday, everything is gonna be different

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Are you part of my family tree?

Or does it tell you what to write?

Will you become part of me?

Is there life after death for me?

Julian Lennon,"There was one who was famed for the number of things
He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
And the clothes he had bought for the trip. 

He had forty-tow boxes all carefully packed,
With his name painted clearly on each;
But since he omitted to mention the fact,
They were all left behind on the beach.

He came as a Baker; but owned, when too late-
And it drove the poor Bellman half mad-
He could only bake Bridecake -for which, I may state,
No materials were to be had.

I came as the Baker on this escapade,
I knead the dough, but I can't look after the bread,
The Banker does it instead,
And although I never feel afraid,

Somehow I know
It could be the single worst mistake I've ever made,
To come as the Baker on this escapade.",The Escapade,1986

Sing your hymns of Evensong,
Sail out to far lagoons,
All you fishermen and you fortune hunters,
Sharpen your harpoons.
Sing rhapsodies to the fickle gods that guide you,
Awake the brave adventurer that sleeps inside you. 
Before you VANISH AWAY LIKE MIDNIGHT SMOKE,
So that no signs or memories remain,
You might VANISH AWAY LIKE MIDNIGHT SMOKE,
And never be seen again.
You sailors, sail your stormy seas;
You gamblers, roll your ball.
All you butterflies and you ballerinas,
Dance until you fall.
Dream and believe; follow what you're searching for,
One day the brave adventurer will be no more.
You just VANISH AWAY LIKE MIDNIGHT SMOKE,
So that no signs of memories remain,
You'll just VANISH AWAY LIKE MIDNIGHT SMOKE,
And never be seen again.

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh my that little country boy could play""

Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying ""Johnny B. Goode tonight""

And nothing's lost at such a cost

Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day

Julian Lennon,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

Julian Lennon,"No money, no pride
Stick your finger in your eye
It's all a joke; it's just a ride
Save it for another guy
Kick yourself in the head
Pretty soon you will be dead
Get yourself another job
Don't become another slob 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life?
Nothing is a guaranteed
Don't hide your face; don't beg and plead
Being sorry for yourself
Put another record on
You're the answer; you're the cause
You're just another perfect flaw
I'm just as scared as you, you know?
But trying all the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Cheap talk won't get you far
Slandering in whiskey bars
Face the facts; the truth's inside
If you want peace, don't try and hide
You don't have to worry
'Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to hurry
'Cause harmony's in sight
You don't have to worry
Just trying to feel alright
Hey
In the end, we're all afflicted
In the end, we're all addicted
In the end, we're junkies too
Unless you have a point of view
Swallow pride; it swallows you
Take that stride; I'll guide you through
Who's gonna help us in the end?
Not your brother, not your friend
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fear is just a crying shame
Work it out or go insane
Think about the world instead
'Cause if you don't
We'll all be dead
You don't have to worry
'Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to worry
'Cause harmony's in sight
You don't have to worry
I'm trying to shake the plight
Well, I've been dreaming of a change that would take place
Where all of God's creatures would love the human race
Hey, oh, oh, oh, why don't you get a life?
Oh, oh, oh
Being wealthy isn't bad
Despising it is what's so sad
Make a move
You've got a choice
Do something useful
With your voice
You don't have to worry
'Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight

Julian Lennon,"Heaven help the soul that's severed
From the place where it belongs
Caught up in the mindless struggle
Of the weak against the strong 
Headlights along the border
Keep the peace; their law and order

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
It's their kind of strength
It's their only defense
An imaginary line

Just a kid and his younger brother
Headed for the wire
Had no rights in the telescopic sights
Of the vigilante's rifle fire

And now he's buried on the border
Where the rivers are blood not water

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines

In times like these concerning
Who decides which bridge is burning
Don't fall for map reading
Just make sure that you're still breathing

After the lines were drawn, the children would
Dream of the pearls and how beautiful they were
Year after year they would dive to the bottom of
The lagoon hoping that the oysters would come back
They risked everything - their homes, families
And meager possessions - to search for the pearls
To make sure they were heavy enough to reach the
Bottom, the children tied stones to their backs
Many of them died; streams of blood and broken
Bodies rose to the surface of the lagoon, and
The lagoon cried

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of strength
Their only defense

Julian Lennon,"When they sell the final weapon, we can all watch it blow
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Gotta keep the people working

In the bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

From the mines of anatolia to the isle of mandalay
Along the coast of sullen africa, they're queuing up to pay
No cause, I don't discriminate, I sell to those who buy
There never was an innocent who didn't want to die
And with demand upon the increase what could keep the cost down
If I keep the people fighting, I can really go to town
No surprise, the cash you borrow, we can close the deal tomorrow
Just swiss francs or dollars won't cause me any borrow, boy

In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

Everybody itching for someone to serve the task
I'll arm the politician for the coup, the crew, the cast,
I have a score of different faces, I can look like a lord
Seen in high places, flying on the concorde

Well you can marvel at precision, you can dial a telephone
Call up color vision from the safety of your home
You can mount the great offensive from a button by the chair
If you arm the right system, you can ionize the air

In a bed of iron, they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed or iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
Like the wind across the frontier or the breaking light of day
I push across the mountains, all around the bay of biscay

Freeze in north america, boil in pakistan
All along the amazon, from the fire to the frying pan

Whether air, sea or battle ground, desert sand or snow
When they sell the final weapon we can all watch it blow

Julian Lennon,"Because of things remembered
Nothing changes; we simply follow
Rhythms that are distant echoes
Ancestors turning in their sleep
Silhouetted on the future
Playful figures that cut across the winking eye
Of God's projector
A partial eclipse of the original light
That eminates in all directions
So the darkness isn't pierced, but rather
Forced to retreat
Pushed out by its own internal explosion
The screen of God's movie is time expanding
And every atom is a solid globular mirror
In which His grotesque anamorphic grin
Splits the darkness!

[Chorus]
Everywhere our world's expanding
Journeys through the soul
Past all thought and understanding
Science or control

Looking to the future
Is looking at the past
In whichever direction you happen to face
You were forward, and I was slipping back
In the time it takes for the light of the stars to stir
The retina, rods and cones
History's in the beholder's eye
Fait accompli
Dans un outre androit
The further away we are, the farther back we see
Unless
We could gaze instantly across the sound
Where, moored like ships, planets anchored
Swing and sway
Golden barges laden down with mists and frozen crystals
Dancing away!

Dreaming of redemption; no end
To the living edit, the sound of amputation
Or the centrifugal pull of an endless bend
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down 
There's a shimmering dog sayin' danger; what's at work here?
The in-growing twitch of faceless laughter
A cause without end to serve forever
The missionary madness of the sacrificial lamb

Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down

Not what he was but what he should've been
And nothing you can do will change the circumstances
Just a mild infuriation with statistics of sin

A circular lie in a calibrated order
Weathering time with salt and water
Tears that you cry are your endeavor
To break into the madness of imaginary lines, until...

Which switch the dampers to absorb the emotion
And trigger the filter that screens out

Julian Lennon,"I have walked through the fire as an ordinary man

'Cause I believe in you and the best is yet to come,
You've been alone it's true, daddy's work is never done.
In my dreams, every night, I see the waves upon the sand
And you and I walk alone and there's a ring upon your hand.
Yes I believe in you and if my prayers are answered now,
I'm coming back , to you, I'm gonna find a way somehow.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Where you are is all there is, the only place I want to be
And love is war and war is cold, when you're so far across the sea.
Still I'm alive, still in love, I hope this letter finds you well,
Through the blood, through the flames, I can hear those wedding bells.

I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,

I'm bored, so clean, and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here, so why oh why oh why the hell can't I?
I only want variety, of society

And finally say, ""You have your way, come to town.""

Julian Lloyd Webber,"I don't know how to love him.
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,

I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.

I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so.

I love him so.",I Don't Know How to Love Him [From Jesus Christ Superstar],1989
Julian Lloyd Webber,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],1989
Julian Lloyd Webber,"When your good nights have been said
And you are lying in bed
With the covers pulled up tight
And though you count every sheep
You get the feeling that sleep
Is gonna stay away tonight

That's when you hear it coming
That is when you hear the humming
Of the midnight train
Here again
Can't explain that midnight train
That midnight train

Are you real? Yes or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go

Come try to take me away
But bring me back before day

Take me to everywhere
But don't abandon me there
Just want to say I've been

Though I may be dreaming sweetly

Julian Lloyd Webber,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!

You know I do.

Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you.

I must go

Wait for me Raoul!

Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!

And soon you'll be beside me!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me

Say you'll share with me one love,

What makes a city hum? Who gives it life? The descamisados, the shirtless ones, the laborers, the butchers, the dockers, the shuffling workers in the stockyard, in the factories and on the treadmill. Do these people have ambitions, views, opinions!
They will soon.

Don't you just love the smack of firm government? We all appreciate the invaluable support, order and purpose provided by the military to our constitution. It will soon be time for the military to be our constitution, say some, notably the military.

The gathering at the polo ground glitters. The Bentleys, the hampers from Harrods, the diamonds, the clothes, the procession of nannies from England and France. Who on earth, or in Argentina, would want to pull the rug out from under the polished feet of le cr??me of Buenos Aires society?

Julian Lloyd Webber,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel

Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise

That every word is true",Don't Cry for Me Argentina,2001
Julian Lloyd Webber,"Love, love changes everything,
hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything,
How you live and how you die
Love, can make the summer fly,
Or a night seem like a lifetime
Yes love, love changes everything,
Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Love, love changes everything,
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything,
Pain is deeper, than before
Love, will turn your world around,
And that world will last forever

Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Off into the world we go,
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly,
All our wisdom disappears

All the rules we make are broken

live or perish, in its flame

No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us

No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is

Sing once again with me

Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind

Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

Were both in you

Both

Were night is blind

Sing...

Christine continues wailing,
and keeps on wailing after every
sentence the Phantom sings

Sing for me...
Sing, my angel of music!
Sing for me!

Julian Lloyd Webber,"Don't write a letter when you want to leave.
Don't call me at 3 a.m. from a friend's apartment.
I'd like to choose how I hear the news...
Take me to a park that's covered with trees,
Tell me on a Sunday please.
Let me down easy, no big song and dance.
No long faces, no long looks.
No deep conversation.
I know the way we should spend the day.
Take me to a zoo that's got chimpanzees.
Tell me on a Sunday please.
I don't want to know who's to blame, it won't help knowing.
I don't want to fight day and night, bad enough you're going.
Don't leave in silence with no words at all.
Don't get mad and slam the door, that's no way to end this.
I know how I want you to say goodbye...
Find a circus ring, with a plying trapeze.
Tell me on a Sunday please.

Vieron un convoy movilizarse entre barrancos

No le gustan los problemas pero no falta 
Quien se enrede y el que se enreda pronto le cambia la suerte 
Porque trae de justiciera su compañera la misma muerte

Más bien vino a enfiestarse
Mando retacar las hieleras con varias carteras de Tecate

Por arroyos van bajando
Por ahí se escuchó una tuba la bandona está retumbando
(Y que es pa' uno compa Regulo Caro?
A tecatear se ha dicho compa Julián)

Le gusta vestirse elegante y otras veces de camuflaje 
Pero lo que si les digo que anda listo 
Pal combate cargan varios R-15,lanza papas, y mucho parque

Solo el que vive lo sabe
La presión que uno se carga y si ven al Pelo Chino 
Con su mirada se espantan más

Es el rubio y pa que se quemen la sinta 
Anda en culiacan o aya por babunica 
O en equipo siempre carga a su cuadrilla 

Nunca anda sobre pleito anda sobre el cotorreo 
Y sabe trabajar dos tres cositas pa los weros 
Gracias al carnal siempre cuentan con su apoyo 
Tambien de sus amigos y sus primos tan sinceros

vedrai sarà più dolce dirsi ti amo
faremo un giro in barca

partire quando Milano dorme ancora
vederla sonnecchiare
e accorgermi che è bella
prima che cominci a correre e ad urlare.
Che domenica bestiale
la domenica con te
ogni tanto mangio un fiore
lo confondo col tuo amore
com'è bella la natura e com'è
bello il tuo cuore.
Che meraviglia stare sotto il sole
sentirsi come un bimbo ad una gita
hai voglia di giocare,
che belli i tuoi complimenti
è strano non ho più voglia di pescare.
Amore mio che fame spaventosa
dev'essere quest'aria innaturale
è bello parlare d'amore
tra un fritto e un'insalata
e dirti che fortuna averti incontrata.

And the grass looks green
And her face looks pale
Under my rainbow machine.

So I took a bite
From a honey tree
And the stars turned angry
As they looked down at me.

She said, do you, do want to, want to.
Do you, do you want to, do you do you want to, she said, ride my star, all night.

Where did you come from girl
Are you from some other place
'Cause you're far from heaven,
Even to my level,
And you're starting to make me hate.

Don't let me fade away
I've only got 4 more lives to live
And there's an angel sat with my finger tips
When in all on my body.

Infiltrate but never find
Just fallin' slowly
You left me so damn lonely

Try
Steppin' back to when we rhymed
Maybe recreate the times
You were shy but happy
And we were fine and dandy

Here we are again, oh
But backseat love don't move me
I'm just far too choosy.

Stop, drop, go through, open up the letter
Don't you want to make it any better
Baby don't you ever wonder why
Back up, it's not that I think you're clever
I just know that we could do much better
Baby, don't you ever wonder why
I was never by your side

Sigh, take a deep breath and rewind
Bite your tongue and let it slide
Got to see a doctor
Maybe that will shock ya
Love don't die, no
Especially when it penetrates and leaves you blind
And shaking mad and reckless
Got you feeling breathless

Here we go again
The backseat love don't move me

And who are you to tell the truth and kill my fantasy
Why are all those people always saying things about me
I'm not a loser, I'm just lonely
Yeah I wanna lay down next to you
But I'm not one to complain
Yeah I wanna touch you too

Do me a favor and appease my aching eyes
Won't you please materialize
Play another of your tricks with my sight
Be here in the flesh tonight

What's that pretty little thing crawling up my wrist
Call me crazy, call me a masochist

Hmm..mmm..mmm...
Mmm..mmm...
Mmm..mmm...
Mmm.....
Deepening night, think on a time 
All was bright
Here in this dark place, I see in your face
All is not right
Make it, make your way home 
Better than the last
Break it, break the alone
Take a second chance
Open a window, let in the snow
Cold is all I know
Go to the fire, stir it around
There's a warmer place for you to go
So, make it, make your way home
Better than you have
Break it, break the alone
Leave it in the past
Oh, look and you'll find it
Someone wants to love you
Look and you'll find it
Someone wants to love you
Wake it, wake your dream
One forgotten me
Sleepin' deep inside o' you
Heavenly peace",Make It Home,1996
Juliana Hatfield,"Shall I see tonight sister, bathed in magic greet
Shall we meet on the hilltop where the two roads meet.
We will form the circle, hold our hands and chant,
Let the great one know what it is we want. 

Danger is great joy, dark is bright as fire,
Happy is our family, lonely is the ward. 

Sister, we are waiting on the rock and chain
Fly fast through the airwaves, meet with pride and truth. 

Danger is great joy, dark is bright as fire,
Happy is our family, lonely is the ward. 

Father, we are waiting for you to appear.
Do you feel the panic, can you see the fear ?
Mother, we are waiting for you to give consent.
If there's to be a marriage, we need contempt. 

Danger is great joy, dark is bright as fire,
Happy is our family, lonely is the ward.

Juliana Hatfield,"Say hello
As if your life depended on it
Crack a joke, light his smoke
As if your life depended on it 
You can't handle his beautiful eyes
And all they symbolize
No flowers in your bottles
No view of the moon from you room
No baby in your belly too 
Behind your sleepy eyes
You're hyper-aware of time
Ticking away towards your bed
( Towards your bed )
No one to go home to
Your life is boring you
So you're living for the guy that you just met 
( That just met )
There's no such thing as pleasant conversation
It's all just drowning victims gasping for air
You need somebody to save you now
'Cause you are surrounded and they're closing in 
He gives me a beer
I take a sip
As if my life depended on it
'Cause everything matters
And if he doesn't take me up inside
I know I'm gonna die 
Behind your sleepy eyes
You're hyper-aware of time
Ticking away towards the end

Juliana Hatfield,"Coming to the edge of nowhere
Daydreaming of unconsciousness
The closer that I get
The further I am gone 

The horizon is steadier than steal
Where the world ends and the sun disappears
I can't move
The pain is too real
It slips into color I can feel
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel 

The reds go up
The blues go down
The lights go off
The dark pulls on

The reds go up
The blues go down
The lights go off

If I fall will I rise?
If I jump will I fly?
If I fall will I rise?

I show some tit,
And let you pinch my ass
I'll cut you some slack
So why don't you want me 
Why don't you want me

Juliana Hatfield,"Southern California is bad for the soul
And New York City takes its toll

Juliana Hatfield,"The gauge is on e
I'm gripping the wheel
The map is so hard to read
I can't see the road
I can only see

From my hand to my mouth
From right here to the ground
But I'm too far gone to go back

Where will it end? 
My weary eyes
On the space
Right in front of me.
My mind imagining
Love and empathy
Or just some company saying

Don't let go
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo 
Don't you know I know? 
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo 
Oh don't let go.

An angel takes the wheel
I climb into the backseat
And get under the blanket where sleep can bathe me in dreams
With a warm humming engine and spacemen three
Sleeping with Jesus
I just need to rest.

And I cry like a baby
Who fell out of the cradle
A feeling of release
How hard can it be
To speak clearly? 

Don't let go
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo 
Don't you know I know? 
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo 
Oh don't let go.

Pull over and get out
You're down, clinging to the earth
You want the world to stop
Discover unknown reserves
Get up, brush off the dirt
Get back in

And don't let go.

Don't you know I know?

Push me off the dividing line
You won't give a little
What good graces? 
No explanation for your change of heart
You left the inside out
You get a little or a lot
You're either cold or you're hot
A ceiling of clouds
The tall buildings are walls
I'm walking around and I can't get out
The general fatigue of a private person trying to talk to you
You saw the movie, you don't need to read the book
A masterpiece or a piece of shit.
You're either stealing or you're taken.

You're so down on me
I think it is a fad so I don't feel so bad anymore.
You're so down on me

And watch the sleeping dogs die

My face has changed
I don't look the same
A human mutation
Alienation factory
Too much information, maybe.

What a bad judge of character you were
I would fake it if I could
It would probably be for my own good
Honesty is a curse
It only makes it worse.

Waiting for something, I don't know what
They don't see me so they're not scared
But they tread lightly everywhere

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

Sunset?s pink and orange and lavender and gray
There's a bird on a branch at the top of the tree
We wanted the world to give us a chance
Now we're pushed out to the edges

If we stand still blinded by the lights
Is it murder or suicide?

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Over the sand

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

I stayed till the last of the bottles was empty
And whizzing by my head
I stayed till there was no more air in the room
And my tears no longer moved you
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

Then it was over and I will never be the same

With pride and grace and faith in myself
Knowing how the world works and the way that things change

With your chairs that no one sits on and your starched and ironed sheets

We will always be beautiful, beautiful
Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful on the night we kissed in the stairwell

Is anybody listening?

Juliana Hatfield,"She writes songs at night
After everyone has turned out the lights
Though she's still young
She's had a hard life
And she's not giving up believing in fate
And it makes a person strong being alone for so long

The family home it's like living in a war zone
Holes are punched in walls
But no one seems to care at all

[Chorus]
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
So with patience she waits

No one ever had her back
They only laugh when she cries
But in God's eyes

[Chorus]

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
And with patience she waits

Juliana Hatfield,"I broke down on 14th street, I could have been blind
And you could have been anywhere in the world but I saw you in my mind
In flashing colors in the middle of the night
Don't they say that in the darkness everything is black and white

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

I found myself in Brooklyn, it was as real as a dream
Then I went back up to Boston with absolutely nothing but a feeling

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

How I wish I could escape the human things
Don't take me for a woman, I am only the song you sing

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Lonely love, lonely love, lonely love, this lonely love

You always have trouble sleeping
It never feels like heaven
It never seems like a sweet thing

Geheimnisvoll wie ihr Lächeln

Schon seh ich wieder
In meinem Kopf die alten Bilder
Zerbrochne Ringe
Das Ende kam mit ihr
Und nun treff ich sie wieder hier

Braungebrannt und niemals lang allein

Hunger, der von Liebe gar nichts weiß

Mit dem sie unsern Traum zerstörte

Sie kennt mich nicht mehr
Sie hat sich längst getrennt von ihm

Verbindet mich mit ihr

How could she do this to me?""

Right out of my life

'Cause when our friends begin
That heartless rumor
I know I'll really need
My sense of humor

I'm gonna laugh you
Right out of my life
Make it a beautiful joke
No one will know you broke my heart

But if I find you
And I really meant that last goodbye
Then I'm gonna laugh so hard

Julianne Baird,"I heard how all the lights went out in Memphis
On the death night anniversary of the king
The pretenders talking dirty in the palace
But it doesn't have that old familiar ring

I see there's been some changes in the valley
All the renegades have finally settled down
Now they worship in the temples of their rivals
And desecrate the holy heart of town

Can't you hear all those sweet voices singing
Takin' care of the chosen ones
Can't you hear all those mission bells ringin'
Say a prayer for the chosen ones

I read they're pourin' oil on troubled waters
Yet they cast a giant shadow on the land
Let's spend another night across the border
And bury all our secrets in the sand

Now they claim there is a message in the Bible
They swear there is no master and his slave
But the future's lookin' dim for the lonesome cowboy

Some never should've been boyfriends that ended in heartache
But I still try to see the brighter side

What goes around don't always come around

And I still haven't figured a damn thing out about life

I've got bars around my heart, but I still believe
There's someone out there with a key

I still dream and I won't give up the fight
And who knows if I'll ever get it right

And she said, ""I'll be fine.""

Wonder how long she's been drinking, like this
She looks me in the eye and says, ""I swear I'm quitting.""

That they don't need help
How am I suppose to reach a soul

You've got to

Wrapped tight 'round some cigarette

You better hide your matches

I'm afraid to draw you near
Cause I could get so lost in you that I might disappear

Julianne Hough,"You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

(I) don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say

(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)

I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day

Julianne Hough,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here somehow
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

See the policeman yawning on his lonely beat.
Gay lady, Mayfair in the morning,
Hear your footsteps echo in the empty street.

All Park Lane in a shimmering gown.
Nothing ever could break or harm
The charm of London Town.

In our city darkened now, street and square and crescent,
We can feel our living past in our shadowed present,
Ghosts beside our starlit Thames who lived and loved and died
Keep throughout the ages London Pride.

Nothing ever could override

Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked, miserable past
There must have been a moment of truth

Whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
Stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by

Then I'll never sigh or cry

Julie Andrews,"Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.",The Physician,1968

Thinking love would flame in you forever
And I'd never, never know the flame was there

Then one day we cast away our secret longing
The raging tide we held inside would hold no more
The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Ev'ry joyous word of love was spoken

And now there's twice as much grief
Twice the strain for us
Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us

Here we are, my love
Silent once more
And not far, my love

The Lusty Month of May

Tra la, it's May, the lusty Month of May
That lovely month when everyone goes blissfully astray
Tra la, it's here, that shocking time of year
When tons of wicked little thoughts merrily appear

It's May, it's may, the month of great dismay
when all the world is brimming with fun, wholesome or un-
It's mad, it's gay, alive a lust display
Those dreary vows that everyone takes, everyone breaks
Everyone makes divine mistakes

For poor on'ry people like you and like I... 
I wonder as I wander out under the sky. 

When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall, 
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all. 
But high from God's heaven a star's light did fall, 
And the promise of ages it then did recall.

A star in the sky, or a bird on the wing,

He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King.",I Wonder as I Wander,1982

The world was ready for a blue kind of music
And now they play it from Steamboat Springs to La Paz.

""Le Jazz Hot"" maybe
And don't ever let it end.
I tell ya, friends, it's really something to hear,
I can't sit still when there's that rhythm near me.

I'll never know ahat made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

(It's after three now)
(Don't you agree now)
(She ought to be in bed)

I could have danced all night (You're tired out, you must be dead)
I could have danced all night (Your face is drawn, your eyes are red)
And still have begged for more (Now say goodnight, turn out the light)
(Please, it's really time for you to be in bed)

I could have spread my wings (Do come along, do as you're told)
And done a thousand things (Or Mrs. Pierce is apt to stir)
I've never done before (You're up too late, please, it sure is late)
(Miss, you'll catch a cold)

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he (Put down your book, the work'll keep)
Began to dance with me (Now settle down and go to sleep)
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

(I understand, dear)
(It's all been grand, dear)

Julie Andrews,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music [From The Sound of Music],1999
Julie Andrews,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you, 
Come rain or come shine. 
High as a mountain and deep as a river, 
Come rain or come shine. 
I guess when you met me 
It was just one of those things, 
But don't ever bet me, 
""Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me. 
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me, 
Come rain or come shine. 
Happy together, unhappy together 
And won't it be fine.

We're in or we're out of the money,

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

Julie Andrews,"Nobody does it better makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest

Julie Andrews,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(Come on and) Dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (Those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)

Julie Andrews,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2000

Honey, don't you smile, let us rest awhile

Julie Andrews,"I could cry salty tears 
Where have I been all these years? 
Little wow, tell me now 
How long has this been goin' on? 

There were chills up my spine 
And some thrills I can't define 
Listen sweet, I repeat 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Oh, I feel that I could melt 
Into heaven I'm hurled 
I know how Columbus felt 
Finding another world 

Kiss me once, then once more 
What a dunce I was before 
What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Let me dream that it's true 

Kiss me twice, then once more 
That makes thrice, let's make it four 
What a break, for heaven's sake
