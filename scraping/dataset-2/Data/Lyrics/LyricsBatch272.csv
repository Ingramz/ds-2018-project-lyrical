Frank Sinatra,"Dear, this evening seemed to go so awfully fast
We had so much fun and now you're home at last
I look forward to a kiss or two at the garden gate
But she gave me just one peck and insisted it was late

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms
Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms, ah, come on",Five Minutes More [From Sweetheart of Sigma Chi],1995
Frank Sinatra,"Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Though I see
The danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in",Fools Rush In [Alternate Take],1995
Frank Sinatra,"Hello young lovers whoever you are 
I hope your troubles are few 
All my good wishes go with you tonight 
I've been in love like you 

Be brave young lovers and follow your star 
Be brave and faithful and true 
Cling very close to each other tonight 
I've been in love like you 

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels 
And to fly down the street in a trance 
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet 
And you meet, not really by chance 

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do 
Don't cry because I'm alone 
All of my mem'ries are happy tonight 
I've had a love of my own 

I've had a love of my own like yours 
I've had a love of my own","Hello, Young Lovers [From The King and I]",1995
Frank Sinatra,"O give me a home where the buffaloes roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

[Chorus:]
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Where the air is so pure and the zephyrs so free
And the breezes so balmy and light
That I would not exchange my home on the range
For all of the cities so bright

[Chorus:]

How often at night when the heavens are bright
With the light of the glittering stars
I stand there amazed and I ask as I gaze
Does their glory exceed that of ours?

[Chorus:]",Home on the Range,1995
Frank Sinatra,"What is America to me
A name, a map, or a flag I see
A certain word, democracy
What is America to me

The house I live in
A plot of Earth, a street
The grocer and the butcher
And the people that I meet

The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races and religions
That's America to me

The place I work in
The worker by my side
The little town the city
Where my people lived and died

The howdy and the handshake
The air a feeling free
And the right to speak your mind out
That's America to me

The things I see about me
The big things and the small
The little corner newsstand
Or the house a mile tall

The wedding and the churchyard
The laughter and the tears
The dream that's been a growing
For a hundred and fifty years

The town I live in
The street, the house, the room
The pavement of the city
Or the garden all in bloom

The church the school the clubhouse
The million lights I see
But especially the people
That's America to me",The House I Live In,1995

Frank Sinatra,"I am loved, I am loved by the one I love in every way,
I am loved, absolutely loved,
What a wonderful thing to be able to say.
I'm adored, I'm adored by the one who first led my heart astray,

I'm adored, absolutely adored,
What a wonderful thing to be able to say.
So ring out the bells, and let the trumpets blow,
And beat on the drums, 'cause now I know, I know,

What a glorious thing to be able to say.

Frank Sinatra,"If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers, as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Frank Sinatra,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You,1995
Frank Sinatra,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

Frank Sinatra,"I should care, I should go around weeping
I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well
Except for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep

So I should care, I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do

But I should care and I do

And I do",I Should Care [From Thrill of a Romance],1995
Frank Sinatra,"I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say

Take me back, I love you
It hit me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along

Without you",I'm a Fool to Want You,1995
Frank Sinatra,"If I loved you, time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come in an easy way
`Round in circles I'd go
Longin' to tell you but, afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day

Frank Sinatra,"I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble or I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money or spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame honey for what I do
I know that I can be a beggar or I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
But depends on you
I can be very lonely when I'm out with the crowd
I can be humble or I can be proud
But depends on you

I can save a great deal of money or I can spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame baby for what I do

I can be a beggar or I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you",It All Depends on You [From Big Boy],1995
Frank Sinatra,"Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you, speak my name
Softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When, two lips of coral, want to kiss

I say that the devil is in you, and to resists you - I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart",Lover [From Love Me Tonight],1995
Frank Sinatra,"The statue in the harbor is a lovely sight
The Rockettes in precision are a sheer delight
But I for one would rather visit John McKnight
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet me at the Copa tonight
There are those who just adore the Art Museum
And out in Brooklyn, there's a ballpark and it seems
But I don't care a whole lot if I never zeem
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight
The show goes on, and on, and on
Do you hear the applause and the cheering
Even if you're wooing, drop what you're doing
Hurry down to see what you're hearing
On 52nd street, they now have burlesque
And you count the effervescence and the view
But all that stuff that squares is my advice to you
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight
Now some of you may like to go to movie shows
Or walk along Fifth Avenue to view the clothes
But here's the place that's famous for geriatric nose
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight
You'll see the nicest people in the nicest cars
They constantly use the lounge across the lovely bars
And it's the spot where stars come just to see the stars
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight
The show goes on, and on, and on
Do you hear the applause and the cheering
Even if you're wooing, drop what you're doing
Hurry down to see what you're hearing

It's imitated quite a lot but this is it
And if you want to see where the new acts hit

Meet at the Copa tonight",Meet Me at the Copa,1995
Frank Sinatra,"It was a most romantic interlude
And we were in a most romantic mood
Our hearts were lost in reverie
I only knew you were close to me
 
The music stopped, but we were still dancing
Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love

Frank Sinatra,"My girl is violin and candlelight,
My girl is star-shine on a summer night.
Lucky heart to be part of a love like this,
Where every single kiss is a short-cut to heaven.
Heaven knows, she's everything that's dear to me,
She smiles, and cloudy days are clear to me.
Yes, the world is my oyster and I got the pearl,
And I'm happy 'cause I got my girl.
My girl is autumn days and skies of gold,
A fire to dream by, when the night is cold.
Yes, the world is my oyster and I've got the pearl,
I'm happy 'cause I've got my girl.",My Girl,1995
Frank Sinatra,"Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancies, maybe
You know, honey, I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Just wait until the sun shines through
Smile, my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too

Frank Sinatra,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you",My Romance [From Jumbo],1995
Frank Sinatra,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer show'are is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day
You are the one
Only you 'neath the moon 
Or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
No matter, darling where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why it is so
That this longing for you 
Follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me

Frank Sinatra,"There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The height we called it a day

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament In my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the the dark
A hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No sadder was he than I

But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day",The Night We Called It a Day,1995
Frank Sinatra,"Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day

You don't das make the boss man frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until your dead

Let me go 'way from the white man boss

That's the old stream that i long to cross.

Ol' man river, that ol' man river

So, set 'em up, Joe, I got a little story you oughta know
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad, wish you'd make the music pretty and sad
I could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Till it's talked away

Well that's how it goes and Joe, I know your gettin' pretty anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

That old black magic that you weave so well

Frank Sinatra,"There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the faker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

Are still around us

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Had rolled along th' unbroken song

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

How white the ever constant moon,

Then let the fire start,

I felt romance everywhere

I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenes

Frank Sinatra,"Somebody else told somebody else
And that somebody said we were through
But I don't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

Wherever I walk, the people all talk
And they're saying it's time that I knew
But I don't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

For everyone knows how a rumor grows
When the gossips are doing their worst
But somehow I feel if the stories were real
You would have come to me first

Whatever they say and say what they may
Still it isn't a thing you would do
So I won't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

Love had me reeling before but never like this
Who ever dreamed this could happen
To someone supposed to be smart
I must have really been napping
To let you walked off with my heart

My dreams, and I had quite a few, were never like this
This is too good to be true, but so was that kiss
I know by the way my heart leaps
That this time I'm playing for keeps

Yes, I've had this feeling before
Darling, but never like this

The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway.
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis,
The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.

When a Broadway Baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning,
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn,
Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way.
Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight, let's call it a day.

Frank Sinatra,"Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me, touched my heart and went right through.
I can't tell you why, I only know that I fell helplessly in love with you.
How I fell in love with you!
I could say you're grand and therefore I care for you so.
But there is a why and wherefore and I'd like to know.

Maybe it's because the star I wished on, made a certain wish come true.
Or it just should be that you were meant for me, and maybe I was meant for you.
Maybe it's because the song we danced to, told a story old and new.
I can't figure out just why it came about.",Maybe It's Because,1996

Frank Sinatra,"When I take you out tonight with me, honey, here's the way it's gonna be,
You will sit behind a team of snow-white horses in the slickest gig you'll ever see.

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry when I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top.
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters when I drive them high steppin' strutters,
Nosy folks will peep through the shutters and their eyes will pop.

Those wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown, the dashboard's genuine leather.
With nice bright curtains that can roll right down in case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright side lights winking and blinkin, ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinking,
You can keep your rig if you're thinking that I care to swap
For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top.

(Would you say the fringe was made of silk?) Wouldn't have no other kind but silk.
(Has it really got a team of snow-white horses?)
One's like snow, the others more like milk (so you can tell `em apart)
All the world would fly in a flurry, when I take you out in the surrey,

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top.
When we hit that road hell for leather, cats and dogs all dance in the heather.
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop.
The wind will whistle as we rattle along, the cows will moo in the clover

The river will ripple out a whispered song, and whisper it over and over.
Don't you wish you'd go on forever, don't wish you'd go on forever,
Don't you wish you'd go on forever and would never stop

Frank Sinatra,"The light-hearted gay kind of charm you display, that's for me.
The wonderful sly little trick with your eye, that's for me.
What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish;
Do you like the movies, or what is your favorite dish?

The tilt of your chin, when you chuckle or grin, that's for me.
You might as well know that wherever you go, there I'll be
Just to make sure you keep your heart alone and fancy free.
No one else can have it; that's for me",That's for Me,1996

For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

It's just the same old smooth routine, the same old moonlit scene,

Turns out you only used those eyes simply to tell me all those lies,
I really went king-size for the same old song and dance.
Me with a built-in radar, me with a cushion hard,
Winding up number one on the all-time loser's card.

I should forget you but i won't, should hate you but i don't,
It didn't turn out like i planned but if you smile and wave your hand,
I'd go out and hire a band, and wait for one more chance,

Frank Sinatra,"Love may be a gamble or a lead pipe cinch,
Leave your heart in shambles, never give an inch
But however it goes, when it's under your nose,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.

Love may be a fire or a puff of smoke,
Moment of desire or it's go-for-broke,
But however it's planned when it closes your hand,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.

You may be the one in a million who's lucky to win that prize.
You may be the one in a million who gets it between the eyes.
Love may the ocean or a drop of rain,
Choosing as emotion or a constant pain.

You won't know what you've got till your heart is on a spot.
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love may be a double or a fate on balls,
Tiny water buffalo on Niagara Falls,

Though the cards in the game never turn up the same,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love may be a gravel or a two-ton truck
Regal as a sable or a Donald Duck,

But you must not avoid what is basic as Freud,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love is real devotion or it's inhumane.
Still without emotion or a hurricane

So remembering this, when it's close as a kiss,
Take a chance, take a chance on love,
Here's your chance, grab that chance, here is love.",Take a Chance,1996

Hither, page, and stand by me,

Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me pine logs hither

When we bear them thither.

Forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament
And the bitter weather

And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met 
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said ""aces is full pal how about you?"" 
He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please

Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the faker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

Frank Sinatra,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of march that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Frank Sinatra,"Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues [#],2002
Frank Sinatra,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet

I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say ""I hope that you're much better""
And then I'll close the way I do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you

Floating on the silence that surrounds us

from all the earthly cares around us

And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Frank Sinatra,"Sunbeams are gently fading, slowly fading,
And birds are waiting to do their mating,
When eventide is nigh, moonbeams are descending,
The day is ending, a happy ending,
The sun is sinking below the western sky.

[Chorus]
Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown,
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping,
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown

Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven,
When night is falling and love is calling me home.
Daydreams through fields of clover, will soon be over,

And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day,
Sweet dreams have just begun, dear, the day is done, dear,
When skies grow dimmer,
And stars will glimmer along the starlit way.

Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.

I got one suggestion before we embark,
There are a lot of nice things to do in the dark,
But let's not go rowing in Central Park.
Woo, woo, woo.
We're going on the town, New York,
We're riding on a rocket, we're going to really sock it,
Because tonight's the night.
We're going on the tube,
We're going to raise a riot, the Brooklyn Bridge we'll buy it,
And hit the hype tonight, the highest hype tonight.
East side, west side, rouse the city,
One day, one night, that's the pity.
And we won't look ahead,
We'll let the light of dawn get around,
We're really living, Jack, we're going on the town.
Stop fellows, what are we saying?
Look over there, the fleet, doesn't she look sweet?
What did we leave it for? What are we doing on shore?
We're simply crazy about the navy, (how's that?)
We love it more than we can say, (how nice!)
We get like a good fresh air, (uh huh) the ocean's everywhere (uh hum)
That's we hate to get leave and go away.
(It's just so touching, hear them say, take your leave and go away)
(Can't even leave the ship when life is play all the live long day)
Just think of what could we be doing today:
We could be swabbing the deck, sweeping the bunks with a broom,
We could be shoveling tons of coal, down in the boiler room.
Bad news, we got the shore leave blues,
(It just so tragic, hear him sob,)

No she-she, life is peachy

Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn

Into a blue note

Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you

When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world, it smiles with you
When you're laughin', oh babe, when you're laughin'
The sun would-a come shining through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that sighin', come on and be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby
The whole world smiles with you",When You're Smiling [DVD],2007
Frank Sinatra,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again
Starry eyed again, takin' a chance on love

I thought that cards were a frame up, I never would try
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love
Now I prove again that I can make life move again
Um, I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your foot good bye
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love",Takin' a Chance on Love,2007
Frank Sinatra,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [Knickerbocker Holiday],2008
Frank Sinatra,"O come, let us adore Him
Christ, Christ the Lord

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels!

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Oh sing, all ye citizens of Heav'n above
Glory to God
In the Highest glory!

Frank Sinatra,"Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents.
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means
King of the road.

Third boxcar, midnight train
Destination, Bangor, Maine.
Old worn out clothes and shoes,
I don't pay no union dues,
I smoke old stogies I have found
Short, but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means
King of the road.

I know every engineer on every train
All of their children, and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked
When no one's around.
