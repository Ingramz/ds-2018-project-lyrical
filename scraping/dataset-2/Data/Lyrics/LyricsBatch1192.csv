They Might Be Giants,"If only there were some way to shut out
All this noise in my head
Oh wait there already is
It's called McCafferty's Bib

I used to have eleven problems
Then they all went away
When I added one more
Called McCafferty's Bib

Now the gray, gray clouds
Have arrived and the gray, gray clouds
Have decided to stay with us from now on

I ate the whole bottle of pills
And wondered what I had swallowed
And I saw that the label 
Said McCafferty's Bib

And then all the scenery melted away
And in back of it
The only thing left
Was McCafferty's Bib

And the gray, gray clouds
Have arrived and the gray, gray clouds
Have decided to stay with us from now on

In cities all over the world
All the people are suddenly struck
By the same idea

They're massing in public squares
And they're singing a note
That rises from low to high

With one hand they're holding up signs 
Of Bob Hope
In the other hand, everyone's waving 
Mccafferty's Bib

The toothpaste won't go back in the bottle
Since it granted our wish
And we will never be rid
Of McCafferty's Bib",McCafferty's Bib,2018
They Might Be Giants,"I want to say I learned something valuable today
Alas, my murdered remains are incapable of learning anything
Trusted you
I should have never trusted you
In fact I never did
What's the use
I'm not complaining
I'm not anything

Is this what's supposed to happen
When you're only trying to do right in this wicked world?
Probably I should already know this
Probably I should graciously accept what I get

Most people wouldn't hang the corpses up for review
Dearest, I can only hope most people are nothing like you
Nervous tics
That I pretended not to see
That's how I was brought up
Warning signs
Death metal albums
""Hang in there, baby"" poster

Is this how you thank somebody
For their selfless loyalty? Is this what you do?
Pardon me for failing to grasp how this works
Excuse my breathtaking ignorance

Is this what's supposed to happen
When you're only trying to do right in this wicked world?
Probably I should already know this
Probably I should graciously accept what I get",Mres. Bluebeard,2018
They Might Be Giants,"You would give up your right arm to go back
To when you had a right arm
You'll need some muscles to move it backward
Push back the hands of time

Broken glass is glittering like diamonds
Can't hear yourself thinking over the sirens
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time

You wanna sing to drown out the car horn
Squeeze your eyes shut and scream like a newborn
Like a newborn babe

Dawn breaks like a fallen vase
Push back the hands of time
Unwelcome vision of rosy fingers
Push back the hands of time

It wouldn't help you if you'd had any sleep
It wouldn't save you from the mission creep
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time

Screeching tires but never a collision
Endless day without a sunset provision
Endless day

Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time

You wanna sing to drown out the car horn
Squeeze your eyes shut and scream like a newborn
Like a newborn babe

Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time
Push back the hands of time",Push Back the Hands,2018
They Might Be Giants,"Selflessly hiding all emotions inside
Chilly and dry, New England style
Nobody's figured out my twelve fatal flaws
Who's keeping score? Who wins that war?

I'm busting out
And I know everyone agrees

Caring is carting bad ideas to the dump
And taking my time, taking my time
Hey, this microphone was turned on all along

I tried returning all that stuff to the store
But then I bought more, then I bought more
I'm done explaining all these reckless displays
Hard to defend, I'm in a haze

Old stories told
In brand-new clothes I bought today

Kindness is killing off my unfinished dreams
And walking away, just walking away
Hey, this microphone was turned on all along

Caring is carting bad ideas to the dump
And taking my time, taking my time
Hey, this microphone was turned on all along",This Microphone,2018
They Might Be Giants,"I'll make a reckless prediction
I'll still be in the kitchen
When the lights come on
I think we'll probably be good
If stuff is still where it stood
When the lights come on

We won't remember each other
But we'll probably recover
Unless everyone's gone
It might be too soon to say this
But I think that we may just
See the lights come on

See I've been picturing
Diagrams of master plans
I taught myself to draw in the dust
With what remains of my left hand

And from what I can tell
I'll be no more than a shell
Or an automaton
But we'll be laughing and shit
It will have been worth it
When the lights come on

Unless we chicken out again
Which is exactly how we ended up in here
Our guard was down, we were disarmed
They tampered with the smoke alarm

There won't be any more trouble
You'll be dragged from the rubble
When the lights come on
And I'll be looking so great
I will have lost some weight
When the lights come on

We will be growing mustaches
Once we're raised from the ashes
When the lights come on
We'll be encased in gold
Desiccated and old
When the lights come on

See I've been picturing
Diagrams of master plans
I taught myself to draw in the dust
With what remains of my left hand

And from what I can tell
Groping around, there's something else
I feel a face, I feel a pulse

I think I'm
Tripping
Something's got me by the hair
Let's table this discussion
Until my concussion
On the bottom stair

Unless I pass out once again
And find the bandage where my kidney used to be
Knocked over lamp, some broken plates
Prescription pads for opiates",When the Light Comes On,2018
They.,"I get my drinking from my daddy
Used to kick the wisdom while he sipped up on his Brandy
He pushed a Plymouth but that nigga used to whip it like a Caddie
Never saw the method to his madness
Some days I would scream, ""I can't stand you""
And then he slip up say he wished he never had me
I closed the distance once a nigga moved to Cali'
I wish I never moved to Cali'
I can't even hold a grudge no more
Tough love den made me grow up
City full of niggas that I really don't trust
Lonely and I'm drunk so I think I'll call him up and say

He used to pray for them better days 'til they came 'round
Hate where I'm headed but I can't slow down
Pray that I feel the same when I come down, hey
Been tryna make a change, I don't know how
Maybe I was meant to take the long way 'round?
Pray that I feel the same when I come down, hey

Pray that I feel the same when I come down
Pray that I feel the same when I come down
Pray that I feel the same when I come down

Finally on my own, see me on the road
Been a minute since I visit, hate to see you getting old
And I wished I never blamed you for the things you didn't know
Sometimes I wish I still had you to keep me on my toes
How it feel pops?
To see your young boy getting money, got that deal pops
Put a little back up in your pocket
Here pops, I can pay you back for college now for real pops
Finally living like you live

Quit tryna’ act like the trap is cool, ‘cause we tired hearin’ that garbage
Hey, bags of white, pints of lean, I been on dope boys since a teen
But this ain't what we meant to be, and y'all don't make no sense to me
You pump fakin’, ain't shootin’, ain't killin, ain't doin’
Half them thangs you say you doin’, but 116 we stay true an’
Ain't dope dealin’, ain't Po pimpin’, talkin’ ‘bout my own folk killin’
We on that Jesus soul healin’, so serious, gorillas
Wild ain’t we, can't tame us, been changed, can’t change us
1:16 – You can’t shame us. Live that truth; you can't blame us

[Chorus]
I heard him say he bought the block
(Fakin!)
In his song he say he gansta’ but he not
(Fakin!)
Say he makin’ money, cashin’ big checks
(Fakin!)
While his chain leavin’ green on his neck
(Fakin!)
I’m not impressed

So I guess that make you, yes that make you
That make you a faker!

He was all juiced up, thought he was Tupac
‘Til ‘dem boys caught him, hit him with them two shots
Now, he in the station singin’ like he T-Pain
The bullets made him lean, now I guess he’s 2 Chains
He bought that big-league cannon, wrapped it ‘round a 300
Now matter how you put it, boy, that’s still a 300
Stop that fakin’ and the flatchin’ cut it off
Frontin’ like your paper longer than the Power Ball
He think he Scarface, guess he ain’t seen the movie
Keep on fakin’ ‘til you face down in a Jacuzzi
With some killas in you room with some real guns
That don’t make noise and ain’t plastic but they real guns

[Chorus]

Real recognize real; introduce ya’ self
Careful with that cannon boy; you might just shoot ya’ self
Somebody wake em’, tell em’ to stop fakin’
Before they end up lyin’ in the woods buck naked
These killas fulla’ them demons, while you pretendin’ you Scarface
You ain't really no ghetto boy, why you fakin’ that hard face?
That just made him furious; somebody call Fishburne
Tell these boys in the hood 40 cal hits burn
And hell burns hotter, I turn to the Father
I prayin’, “Lord forgive em’ ‘cause they lyin’ like Mufasa
They got these eight’ graders with they eyes on a choppa
I pray the Lord save ‘em ‘fo He drop ‘em and make ‘em stop it

[Chorus]",Fakin',2012
Thi'sl,"Used to be off of them boats was Africans in ropes
Now what get off of these boats is pounds of coke
Or sex slaves, ain't it sick?
What you prefer? Take your pick
High schools got armed guards ‘cause teenagers bear arms
And they'll crack your head and put that video on World Star
That boy you callin' a nerd got a bomb off in his backpack
Plan to get revenge and leave a crater where his class at
I saw the sickest thing when Channel 4 News was on
A momma put a two-year-old inside a stove
We look at third worlds and turn up our nose
Got the nerve to tell God we got it on our own

One nation under God
That's what we supposed to be, that's why I'm praying hard

In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust

Head cold, so I went to Walgreens
Entered the pharmacy and asked for codeine
Told them I'm a rapper, they laughed and told me to leave
I left with Vitamin C and an itchy throat for weeks
We traded cocaine for mollies, heroin for sizzurp
The devil eatin' the hood, I think America's for dessert
The suburbs love rappers, just come to one of our shows
You'll see Tabitha and Matthew repeating all our flows
While you think she tryna get that tat, but think you wearin' a snapback
‘Cause culture don't discriminate and you just thinkin' it's black rap
The poor tryna survive, we forgot about the ghetto
Now my hood is famous, and Satan is Geppetto

To the republic, for which it stands
Please take the government and put it in his hands

In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust

To all the patriots who died in war bloody, every slave
I lift this country to the Lord and in Jesus' name I pray
That the gospel rip our heart, and we turn from wicked ways
I know you gave us this country and they takin' it to date
So listen to me, politician: I'm not talking superstition
It's the fight and the survival of a nation, and we gon' need way more than religion
In a tragedy we run to he who gives us hope and then we get up fixedly
But I pray that we forever let America submit to the King so one day we'll be

One nation under God
That's what we supposed to be, that's why I'm praying hard

In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust

Thi'sl,"Boy I hopped up out the grave, good morning!
Had been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
Ever'body talking tryna seeing me
Disbelief like how he breathin'? He was six feet deep!

What ya sayin'?
Hold up shut ya mouth
Dead man can't holla what you talkin' about?
'Cause once you through that door it ain't no walkin' out
Let me teach you 'bout your time in my coffin now
(Oh) I know you smell it in the air (yeah)
'Cause I been in the grave for too long I swear
People crying, I'm listening
Obituary been written
My face pale, they can't tell
Your boy 'bout to be risen
Your supposed to call the preacher, he's so gone
It's over can't nobody reach him, so so long
Hey but hold on, before you cry and run out
'Cause somebody coming saying something come out

Wake'em! Wake'em up now!
Wake'em! Wake'em up now!
Wake'em! Wake'em up now!
Wake'em! Wake'em up now!

Hopped up out the grave, good morning!
I been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
They bury me in black suit, black tie
I'm alive and I woke up looking fly
So from now on
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From a Dead man walkin' to the risen ones
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From a dead man walkin' there's a Lazarus

They got a missing person report and they can't find the body
Let 'em tell the story, I was shot up at a party
Or was I high-speeding on a bike?
Head on to a truck, high speed for life
You can tell it any way you like
Any story homie I was raised up by the Christ
Still dead man walking, Green Mile
Go and check my grave it's been cleaned out
Now come and look into my eyes bro
You can see the fire go and tell 'em I'm alive bro
Full of power like a wire bro
God connected to me like some cables and I'm fired up
Dead men don't talk, dead lies aren't truth, dead men don't walk
So what that means for me is that they signed off
On my death warrant but I was raised boy and dried off

Wake'em! Wake'em up now!
Wake'em! Wake'em up now!
Wake'em! Wake'em up now!
Wake'em! Wake'em up now!

Hopped up out the grave, good morning!
I been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
They bury me in black suit, black tie
I'm alive and I woke up looking fly
So from now on
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From a Dead man walkin' to the risen ones
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From-from now on you can call me Lazarus
From a dead man walkin' there's a Lazarus

Hopped up out the grave (grave) guerrilla stat
They ain't think that He could do it but He did it now
I mean The Captain, The Almighty Lord
Saint kept us free, all aboard (all aboard)
Can't stop Him when He got His mind made up
He don't like that grave, sayonara see you later
He make the blind see and got the lame up
So it's no surprise He can raise us
(Wake 'em up)
(Wake 'em up) Wake 'em up now

Believe us when your life is lookin' tough now
When you at your all time low
Don't forget that power that He already show

Quero um beijo, meu desejo é te ver
Quando a gente se encontra só você não se dá conta
Que entre nós só tá faltando acontecer

É brincar de provocar sua paixão
E falar no seu ouvido qualquer coisa sem sentido
Só pra ver qual é a sua reação

Ouve essa canção que eu te fiz
No meu coração tem um X
Pra deixar bem claro o que eu quero e preciso dizer
Hoje eu estou tão feliz
Se você quiser vem e me diz
Deixa todo mundo saber

Será que você 'tá na minha?
Eu sei lá o que você quer
Eu sou teu fã de carteirinha
Tudo bem, seja o que Deus quiser

Mas tanto que eu te falei
Falei e nada
Tantas vezes que eu te pedi
Pedi e nada
E se pensa que é dona da verdade
Não é nada
E agora acha que é feliz
Mas 'tá errada

Pois quando a gente se ama é um show
Parece que o amor da gente recomeçou
A cada dia ele aumenta
E o coração não aguenta
De tanto que te esperou

Mas de repente você me deixa só
Aí então a cabeça dá um nó
Assim não muda de assunto
Porque a gente não 'tá junto

Thierry Amiel,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

Thierry Lang Trio,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

To fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or God
And I begged her give me horses 
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
Ah, ah, ah

But she would not think of battle that 
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she the mother of all men 
Had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again 
And asked if she would stay
Ah, ah, ah

Oh, lady, lend your hand, I cried
Oh, let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust in me, she said and filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
I've no such misconceptions
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away
Ah, ah, ah

Thus having spoke she turned away 
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear

I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day

A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made

Few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam

When Diddy Levine lived with Eunice King
He gave her the ring that she wore

Janice the smiling daughter
Who came from a marriage way before
But Eunice was the father that she always saw

Though they never, never, never, never, never, never told her
She always knew the score
You see kids were so much wiser after the wars

But Diddy hadn't had enough, she had to get some more
On a ration piece of paper
She wrote 'Eunice, I'm not sure'

And with her child in her arms
She went looking for a fling
Besides, she didn't like the name 'Mrs. King'

The first time that she heard Damper Dan
Was on the radio
Crooning at a volume that was way, way down low

Diddy was surprised to hear that Damper's name was Dan
Soon after he was a calling
And he asked, begged and pleaded for her hand

Damper's heart was dampened
When Diddy answered ""No, no, no, no, no""
But if she changed her mind she said ""Dan, I'll let you know""

With her child in her arms
She went looking for a man
Besides she didn't like the name Damper Dan

Janice the smiling daughter grew up to be a teenage queen
Through all of her mother's lovers
She kept the name 'Levine'

Behind the picture house she first made her scene
Liked a boy called Allister
Who was dating a friend called Celine

And Celine wasn't mad when Janet came in between
But Allister got scared when he heard
And he joined the U.S.A. Marines

Inheritance you see runs through every family
Who is to say what is to be, is any better
Over and over it goes goodness and badness wind blow

Over and over, over and over
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over
The good wind and the bad wind blow

I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.

Roll me over ans turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.

Roll me over, and I'll turn around.
And I'll move my fingers up and down.

And black death raged across the land
There were many driven by their hunger
To set sail for the Americas

In search of a new life and a new hope

And they spent their life in search of
Fools gold

The old prospector he makes it to the four lane highway
His old compadre, he lays dead in the sand
With outstretched hands he cries, “Are you going my way?”
The people passing by didn't seem to understand

Fools gold
Fools gold

Fools gold

Broken Joe just lying in a gutter
He's gone as low as any man can be
He calls for wine but they'll only serve him water
The bartender say, “We don't sell sympathy”

He tells a strange story about his father
How Sunday mornings they'd go down to the church on the corner
As time grows older his thoughts they grow younger
It is his wish to search no longer

Fools gold
Fools gold
Fools gold
Fools gold

Fools gold
Fools gold
Fools gold
Fools gold

The vulture sits on top of the big top circus arena
He's seen this show before knows someone is going to fall
Just near the part where the beautiful dancing tightrope ballerina
Forgets that the safety net isn't there at all

Down he swoops with claws drawn to take her
Razor sharp so savagely is she mauled
Oh my God, is there no one who can save her?
In steps the fox to thunderous applause

Just to cure his daily need

But he was blinded by the greed

See that nun, she's his sister
She doesn't know that he's gone bad
When they told it to his papa
It drove the old man mad

Just as his mother warned him
From her dying bed
It's alright to lose your heart
But never lose your head

Now the cops have got him surrounded
And he doesn't stand a hope
He wonders how he could be in so much trouble
Over just a little dope

That's the odds I'm going to give
Five to four they blast him away
Three to one he's going to live

Oh, Johnny, you better run

The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear

If God is in the heavens
How can this happen here?
In his name, they used the weapons
For the massacre

Where the sun can see the land

Lay dead beneath the sand",Massacre,1976

That old flame of mine

Love, she comes and goes
True love, she hides then shows
My love, may I propose
That love she comes and goes

Two hearts together two hearts alight
To keep us warm on winter nights

Among the ashes there still remains
A glowing spark in my heart

In my memory I hold you very dearly
Once in all my dreams, my plans, hopes and future schemes

Whenever we are parted
I feel so all alone

With twilight falling
The moon is calling sweet Marie
What the sea tells only sea shells
Are whispering sweet Marie

Into the darkness goes this message sweet Marie
Some lovers are sometimes parted
They must end what they have started
All that's left is the broken hearted, I must depart my sweet Marie

Somewhere out in Arizona
Such a long way from California
I felt so alone there
I was two thousand miles away from home there

Tonight we're going to play Boston
I still don't know what the hell is going on
Oh but I wrote this song
To keep me thinking on about my sweet Marie

Sweet Marie you mean a lot to me
This melody it keeps haunting me

The plan is attack

You took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance

Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
My father he's going crazy
Say's I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On the long hot summer night
 
 It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should have been in by ten

Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
But it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the end

How can we carry on

I'll try and follow
And if you change your mind
I will be waiting here for you tomorrow

I would steal and I would borrow
I'd do anything, anything at all
To end this sorrow

Thin Lizzy,"I've seen a fire start in Frisco
The day that the earth quaked
I've seen buildings a-blazing
Throwing up in flames

I heard men, women and children
Crying out to their God for mercy
But their God didn't listen
So they were burned alive

They went down, down
Deep underground
In the great disaster

I was hanging out in Berlin
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers
March right across the Maginot line

I've seen two world wars
I've seen men send rockets out into space
I foresee a holocaust
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race

Down, down
Deep underground
A great disaster

In the sixteenth century there was a French philosopher
By the name of Nostradamus
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century
An angel of death shall waste this land

A holocaust the likes of which
This planet had never seen
Now, I ask you
Do you believe this to be true?

I was standing by the bedside
The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God, he said, ""Have mercy, mercy""

His body was riddled with a disease
Unknown to man so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

He went down, down
Deep underground

You'll go down, down

You'll go down, down

He's always got a problem, he's got to work it out wrong or right
He's got to work it out, he's so lonely in the night
He's got to work it all alone

Now who in the world would believe that he's got another trick up his sleeve
And who in the world wants to know which way should he go
Which way should he turn? which way should he learn?
Which day should he stop? which way to the top?

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then
I still can recall when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

This living on his own has turned his heart to stone and it's all pain
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone in the pouring rain
Now who in the world would have know
That just a few years ago his love could have grown and grown

Through the rain, the sleet and snow
But the rain, the sleet and snow chills the heart and kills the soul
So the let the cold winds blow
What he doesn't see he doesn't know

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all
He said, watch out for the danger
He said, watch out

The man is a winner for the first time in his life
He looks a little thinner but he says hey that doesn't matter
But if you look closely
You'll see a cold smug self-satisfactory smile behind

And now that he has won it doesn't matter how or which way it was done
Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul
The power is at his fingertips, vengeance is on his lips
But the power he fought to control now has got him in it's grips

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

Having only fears

We came ashore long before the fighting broke
Saw the sign and headed for the big smoke
We met an old woman of the roads, she said ""this life is but a joke""
But we kept on trucking

I'm always thinking, I'm thinking
I'm thinking how much I think about it all
While you're just dreaming, just dreaming, just dreaming
Had you dreamt it all

But I'm the one who's fallen
The one you hear
Here calling across your floor
Here I go again feeling low down

I'll never know, but then I came from the wrong side of town
We were like the lonesome outlaws
We would go which way the wind did blow
Down the open trail that nobody knows

Sometimes it gets lonesome
But there you go feeling low down

And by way of a rope ladder
He tip-toed to where his woman was

Thin Lizzy,"It was a rainy night the night the king went down
Everybody was crying it seemed like sadness had surrounded the town
Me I went to the liquor store
And I bought a bottle of wine and a bottle of gin
I played his records all night
Drinking with a close, close friend

Now some people say that that ain't right
And some people say nothing at all
But even in the darkest of night
You can always hear the king's call
You can always hear the king's call

And I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Didn't know that that was once your brand
Wintertime I spark it to erase the scent of your sadistic man

And drove for hours wasted in the fog
To be where other women wouldn't call you things
Where men wouldn't sniff you out like dogs

If only just once you'd told me you don't like men who treat you like dirt
Who slip you drugs intended to seduce which travel deep and cause you hurt
I wonder what would happen if
You learned to speak of your contempt
Instead you celebrate your face
By lending it to each of them

The redneck in me wants to prove, the college boy is scared to move
The homemaker has quit his job, the nihilist has found a god

A carpenter who takes an axe, a moth who burrows into wax
A chain between you and the ape, the missing link was Joan the Saint

I think you are the girl who sees a quarter inch through everything
Sees bodies underneath their clothes, no faces, only peeled bones

Your father was the artist who took pictures every day of you
And made a stop-motion film that shows you turning into him

Through fiber lips into the waves and through ports of a destroyer

Look through the air, do you see contrails gone from the sky?
Yeah, and you see lovelight reflected from Ed Gein's eye.

A rash of mistakes sweeps the nations' maternity wards.

Borderguards everywhere turn and suck their guns
Every leader is sterilized along with his firstborn son
We can't find the airwaves, they've disappeared into next week
At last god is silent, he's lost all his power to speak

It might be the last of the changes you'd see, but

Cuss much, what's mine? You bust nuts, crunch crunch
Spark the bud, what's what, the white King Tut
Out in so-fuck, look who they dug up, yup, it's the Rugged
On the record with J-Live, I could hardly believe this
I never thought I'd be rapping on no record with school teachers
Hair flinch from the eighties, library, lies bury
TV, tell lies visually, kid you wit me, hostility
Humility, hillbilly, gorilla, he mentally illy
Still is he, actually, really killed me, billy
All that stuff you heard about me, is probably true
Heard I got the AIDS virus, I probably do
Ammunition spitting is him, is it, you listening
Littering written, it's in slippers, get the rebel in him
Sticking it with sinners, sizzlin' rhythm, verbally hit him
Did he did it, or did he didn't, admit it
Pretend he ain't offended, the men and women
Every minute they in it, don't be
Every illiterate ignorant critical dissed it
Every idiot that ain't live it, they talking shit

Give it up, for the Gods & the Earths, ladies and gentleman
All the human families, the wicked can't stand me

One man's penalty's, is another man's boo-whore
The label pun's ironic, courtesy of this sport
Still can't stop a grown man, from pressing report
A free man can either be freedom or free label
When you spent, what you make, to keep making, you can't save
A damn thing, no savings, that's how life'll enslave ya
That's why I strive daily; to be my own savior
I know when shine glows and reflects in my behavior
So caught in between checks, I spilled it in respect
So give it up, if your mission's belittling my position
As a microphone physician, making you listen
Me and Rugged Man relate, through a previous poem
Like he said, I'm mad famous, for being unknown
On records for ten years, I can hardly believe it
Never thought I'd be perceived, as just some rapping school teacher
Just some dude, that can cut and rhyme, same time
Just some conscious kid, that's try'nna save the world through rhyme
Just another underground, hand-to-mouth microphonist
Stop your mirror rap, just to stop you in your tracks
This will stomp you on your track, justice is not just
Another ordinary rapper, I'm the crown royal block
With a velvet bag, matter of fact, and since the swagger is back
And backed by, a whole nation of millions
You can't hold me, my new floor is my old ceiling
That's why I'm guaranteed, to leave you with something you lack, so just

I knew this chick by the name of Vevorine
Who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
We did in the rain, on the hood of a Range
But Vevorine, had a special friend called Heroin
She told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine
In the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
Cause it's a poor man's girl, and I will never give love
To how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
Martin had a dream, nigga, I did too
To make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup
So, I took it that thaw, and hit the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
Momma said, never get high on your own supply
Especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
Reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes in, the more I disappear
Fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
New Year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
Watch this strip, make me back it up, D'Angelo knows the feeling
Off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling
This tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
Watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
I'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past
Baby, you gotta trust me, cause I gotta girl and you got a man
I don't want you to judge me, I just wanna be your friend

That's just how women is, I reminisce
On when I had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch
And I ain't the best, but I ain't never denied
Tell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine
The plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
You get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
I'm on the grind, I don't settle for mines, nigga
With this track, a broad, with a pack, before I peddle a dime

But it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage

From the recording: Third Day, Track #10.

Sometimes things don't work out quite the way
That you wanted them to
Sometimes people don't do all the things
That you wanted them to
There are time when
The answers aren't easy to see
Sometimes we're on a road
Going back to a place we never wanted to be

Chorus:
Well that's alright
I'm just fine. Done made up my mind
That I'm livin for Jesus

When I'm alone and feeling down
Now, down so deep in my heart
I turn to Jesus and ask Him
For a brand new start
He's the reason for my life
Being something better and new
And now I've finally found a love
That is proven tried and true

And they've dragged you to your knees
But in your weakness you will learn to find
That I will always be your strength

It will never keep you down

So rise up, my friend

And all of the secret things you have done
No matter what comes, my friend
Nothing can keep you from the love of God

I never know when I'm done

Vapor round your body glistens in the shower
And I want to stay right here and go down on you for an hour
Or stay, and let the day just fade away
In wild dedication, take the moment of hope
And let it run, and never look back at all the damage we have done now
To each other

They never go as planned
I wanted to thank you for a vision that was lost that you returned but
You're pa**ed where you understand

Now her appetite is blown, little else is known
Except she's a little angry, grabs a towel and looks away
And the heat fades with the day
And I fall down on what to say

Oh something clean let me be clever
Hey oh well whatever
But that's not what I mean
When where we've been has left us burned
Still I won't turn now from a fight you know I'll never win

I didn't give up on you

He is born again and it's not easy being me
But I can't promise I will mend or bend
When you believe that we are fixed now from our birth
And I've just fallen back to earth

Still you know I'll try again
'Cause I believe that we are lucky
We are golden we have stolen manners
In the days we were one

Doing crystal myth 
Will lift you up until you break

I won't come down, I keep stock 
With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop 
And then I bumped up 
I took the hit I was given 
Then I bumped again

In the city we tripped 
On the urge to feel alive 
But now I'm struggling to survive 
The days you were wearing 
That velvet dress 
You're the priestess, I must confess 
Those little red panties 
They pass the test 
Slide up around the belly 
Face down on the mattress 
One 
Now you hold me 
And we're broken 
Still its all that I want to do 
Feel myself with a head made of the ground 
I'm scared but I'm not coming down 
And I won't run for my life 
She's got her jaws just locked now in smile 
But nothing is all right

Talking endlessly, not a kind word to say 
Till your amber beads of wisdom come 
And I want to write 'em down

I can't forget the smell 
Of summer trees at midnight 
Bendin' backwards to please the wind 
You touch the tattoo of the sun 
On a warm belly that once 
Carried a baby for a while 
Then let that crackled leather jacket round you fold 
Red face saints monogrammed in gold 
And in this beauty 
I would not go any further

We can't live this way forever 
Idle daylight, oh

I felt the passing of these days goin' by

That you have is through

Ring there goes the phone 
And then you're off again 
On what the caller brings 

So I went and trashed myself at the bar 
Confused for nothing thinking you'd be there 
I'm so embarrassed 'cause it's you 
Who comes to take care of me 
Shambling home again with you to lead 
And it's not the way I want to go 

And I'm mad at you and I'm mad at me 
Talking endlessly, not a kind word to say 
Till your amber beads of wisdom come 
And I want to write it down 
Just the way you said it 
So I could keep it always 

I can't forget the smell 
Of summer trees at midnight 
Bending backwards to please the wind 
You touch the tattoo of the sun 
On a warm belly that once carried a baby for a while 
Then let the cracked leather jacket round you fold 
Red face saints monogrammed in gold 
And in this beauty I would not go any further 
'Cause I suddenly remembered 
We can't live this way forever 

Idle daylight 
I've never caught you in a lie 
Not until now 
I feel somehow
The passing of these days gone by 
What will you do when the feeling 
That you have is through 

I need to know 
'Cause I'll never stop hanging on to you 
And it's times like this that I dread 
When there's everything to say 
And nothing left 
To be said",Tattoo of the Sun,1997

So deep into my soul,

The silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save,

And I can't get enough. 
After we did it by the window sill, 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky, 
presently in the quilt that your mother made, 
And a candle burns to fight off the gloom,

but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek. 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep,

That's when I knew I could never
Have you

I knew that before you did
Still I'm the one who's stupid
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I never been so alone
And I've never bee n so alive

The cigarette ash flies in your eyes
And you don't mind, you smile
And say the world doesn't fit with you

Careening through the universe
Your axis on a tilt , you're guiltless and free
I hope you take a piece of me with you
And there's things I'd like to do
That you don't believe in

Someone would see through that
And this is our last time

It starts to rain I paddle out on the water
Alone
Taste the salt and taste the pain

Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage

Doing crystal myth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

How do I get back there, to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else, to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive, those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One
And you hold me, and we're broken

Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life

But nothing is all right, all right

Deep inside of you

Fall breeze blows outside, i don't bring stride
My thoughts are warm, and they go deep inside of you

I would change myself if I could
I'd walk with my own people if I could find them,
And I would say that I'm sorry to you,
I'm sorry to you, but I don't want to call you,
But then I want to call you cause I don't want to crush you,

I breath by your looks and you look right through me

Can we try and take the high road though we don't know where it ends

Still wonder what the fuck it says, hoping there is time

Can we talk about tomorrow and the promise that it brings

I wonder where we're all going, I'm homesick for your primal knowing
I wonder why the wind keeps blowing you through my mind

Go our ways and take taxis home

Want to obey
But you're writing your own ticket to the price
You will pay
Us you hold hock but the drawback is not
To us alone
Time will make you too a victim before you
See the wrong
 
And the melody that you are playing is
In the wrong key
For Jah's choirs that sings out to all live
In world harmony
 
And I just got to say
You're playing us too close
We in the ghettos
You're playing us too close
Red black white brown and yellow poor people
You're playing us too close
The babies are crying
You're playing us too close
Good people are dying
 
So take heed and do let it be known that
I've told you today
Jah say you're playing us much too close
 
Now when I was just a little boy my grandfather
Use to say to me,",You're Playing Us Too Close,1982
Third World,"By William Clarke

You've got the Power
You've got the Power Ahoy

I-been to so many places not knowing just
What I'd find
I seen so many different faces but they
Always stay fresh in my mind

Some of them seem so lonely trying to make it
On their own
Wondering where to turn to knowing you can't
Make no blood out of stone



(Chorus ""A"")
People everywhere they just want to be free
But they find it so hard to he what they gotta be
Gotta he the teaching of their society

(Chorus ""be"")
Brother you've got the Power to make a
Change
Sister you've got the Power rearrange

(Repeat Chorus ""A"" & ""be"")

I've been through hard time decisions
When I could not tell right from wrong
But at the end of my destination
I've found out that's just where I belong

(Repeat Chorus ""A"")
(Repeat Chorus ""be"" four times)

And harlots madchild prevails tails of the unwanted 
Not to be taken for granted 
My past has come back and haunted for real

Mistakes we have made
Ignoring the ones that we hold dear
Out of selfishness

All these things distract our eyes
And steal our time

Why do we keep fighting
Saying every thing's alright?
We all see the same things
Why can't we stand side by side?
If we love each other we can change the world

I'm learning to take the smallest steps
And making a way
Can You take anymore?
Can You stand by while our world crashes down?

Be the spark, forsake your pride
And set things right

I mean it when I hope that you're ok
I hope you've made peace in your own way
And you're still in my head even though we've grown apart

We met way too young, grew up too fast
The love that we had could never last
But the westside's always pulling
Returning you into my current

She said it's too hard to comprehend
I just wanna feel safe again

Thistle,"It was love at first sight 
When I talked to her 
It was the beginning of a real good time 
All I knew was her 
And when I came around 
Love had lingered on my mind 

She said on the telephone 
She wished me well. 
So alive with a spell 
Until I hung up early 
I've realized 
I've been dead for so long 

All my memories of her 
Like a fading light I suffer 
Thinking of our love for so long 
Back in the early days 
I saw a lot of her 
She was the coolest girl in town 

And when I saw her standing there 
Everything was all right 
I took a journey in my mind 
And as I saw her beauty 
She was so kind 
That was a good time 

Everyday we met it was wild 
I felt like a child 
I loved to see her smile 
And as I played piano 
I was so inspired 
I always had a real good time 

And when last we met 
I just can't forget 
I took for sure I love her bad 
I just can't ignore 
Her loving response 
I always knew she'd be all right

She made me think I was okay 
And the love seemed so real 
I still got feelings for her 
And when I'm on tour 
Singing about her forever 
I'll remember blessings
And the good times we had

I really tried to play the game of love 
And I hate to loose 
Maybe I can win somehow 
And so I'll dream of her 
For a thousand years 
Until I see another girl 

That's the way it always was 
That's the way it always was
That's the way it always was",Love Not Dead,2004

I saw the photograph.

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Cold comfort for change
