Pat Flowers,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you",Ain't Misbehavin',2000
Pat Flowers,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me,2000
Pat Flowers & His Rhythm,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,2000
Pat Flowers & His Rhythm,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You),2000
Pat Flynn,"I will pledge my heart
To the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'll forsake my rest
For your happiness
'Til my death I will stand by you

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you
No other to take
For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue
'Til my death I will stand by you

There are wars and there are rumors
Of wars yet to come
Temptations we'll have to walk through
Though others may tremble
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
'Til the battle is won, I will not rest
'Til my death I will stand by you

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you
No other to take
For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue
'Til my death I will stand by you

'Til the battle is won
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

Pat Flynn,"Charlie's got a gold watch 
Don't seem like a whole lot 
After thirty years of drivin' 
Up and down the interstate 
But Charlie's had a good life 
And Charlie's got a good wife 
And after tonight she'll no longer 
Be countin' the days 

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses 
Ten more miles on his four day run 
A few more songs on the all night radio 
And he'll spend the rest if his life 
With the one that he loves 

They'll buy a Winnebago 
Set out to find America 
Do a lotta catchin' up 
A little at a time 

With pieces of the old dream 
They're gonna light the old flame 
Doin' what they please 
Leavin every other reason behind 

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses 
Ten more miles on his four day run 
A few more songs on the all night radio 
And he'll spend the rest if his life 
With the one that he loves

Pat Flynn,"There's a lighthouse in the harbor

   Giving guidance with its light

      But I had no one to return to

   As I wandered through the night

   From the first time that I saw you

   Standing silent by the shore

      I knew my search was over

   And I would look for love no   more
Deep in the waters of love I am falling

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'

Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
    
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
   There's a ship on the horizon

   Makin' its way against the wind
                             
      From the place where I stand watching

   I swear my ship is coming in.


Deep in the waters of love I am falling

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'

Pat Flynn,"The keys in the mailbox the you-Haul is loaded
This is the last time we'll call this place home
The cats in a cage to leave at your mother's
I'll be halfway to Ashville when you wake up alone
It's been a while since I've seen Carolina
It always was pretty this time of year
And if this is the end of life as we knew it
You won't find me living around here
I love life, as we knew it
I still can't believe we threw it away
Goodbye that's all there is to it
Life as we knew it ended today
I'll leave a number if you need to reach me
You always called when I had to be gone
I know that here in my memory
Life as we knew it still lives on

I still can't believe we threw it away

Pat Flynn,"  Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
   She really made the Woolworth counter shine              
   Eddie was a sweet romancer, and a darn good dancer
   They'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
 
Eddie played the steel guitar, and his mama cried cuz he played in the bars
And kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene, lost a child in Tennessee
Still that love survived, 'cause they'd sing

   Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
   Dance a little closer tonight
   Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
   And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
One of the boys in Eddie's band took a shine to Rita's hands
So Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife
Oh but he was back by June, singin' a different tune
And sportin' miss Rita back by is side.  And he sang...

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
Eddie traveled with the barroom bands till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
Rita's got a house to keep, dimestore novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night.  And they sing:

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, hey it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair

I hear that lonesome sound
Ooh, train of memories

With all my dreams inside
Ooh, train of memories

I see you wavin'
Hear you say goodbye

It brings me back to you

Pat Flynn,"Do you fear this man's invention that they call atomic power?
Are we all in great confusion, do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion may ring down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction blotting out the works of man

[Chorus]
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the end?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?

There is one way to escape and be prepared to meet the Lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus, He will be your shield and sword
He will surely stand beside and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest

[Chorus]

There's an army who can conquer all the enemy's great bands
It's a regiment of Christians guided by the Savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls and all it's fury great
God will surely save His children from this awful, awful fate

Pat Friday,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

And my friends seem to think I have a lot more time
But as far as I'm concerned, all the money that I earn
Is going to this 1-900 line
She said I was the greatest lover she'd ever heard
She said that I had too much love for you
And for a small five dollar cover she'd be my long distance lover
And so long as I pay she'll never say we're through

But I've got an eight hundred dollar credit line

And I can't say I blame them, 
For saying what they're saying, 
'cause right now I'm just holding on.

I'm just an old dancehall dreamer,
Living my life in the past,
I keep holding on to dreams and them slow moving trains,
And I don't know how long I can last.

So I called out to Jesus, 
Said Lord I really need you, 
You've got to carry me for a while, 
I've been running too long, 
Singing these old tired songs, 
As the wheels keep pourin out the miles, 
Like I said I'm just a dreamer, But I've gotta' keep believing,

Where I can hold your body close to mine

Beat up, broke down, no place left to turn
Well, I took you back to Texas

And took my love so far away from me
Yeah, he hauled you off to Boulder
Where the air gets much colder

Than this southern boy would ever like to see

When being alone gets the best of me

Pat Green,"My brother and I used to go down to George's Bar, and drink big O's until they close down the place, we'd talk about our live long ambitions,
I still recall the smile upon his face. 
He took off for the bright lights of Austin, 
Said Pat don't you know there ain't no money here, 
He made a billion bucks selling computers, 
I still go down to George's and drink my beer.

He's gone, he may be gone, but I'm still here. 
He's gone, he may be gone, but I'm still here.

There was this curly headed girl back in the seventh grade, 
She didn't even know she caught my eye, 
We dated for a while back in high school, 
I thought that one day she'd be my wife. 
The road took a turn it was  somewhere around eighteen, 
She took off to find her own way, 
Feelin for some Nashville high roller,
 I just know he gonna break her heart one day.

She's gone, she may be gone, but I'm still here, 
She's gone, she may be gone, but I'm still here.

I used to go to my grandpas house every Sunday, we'd watch the Dukes of Hazard on TV, 
Sit around sometimes he'd tell us stories, about how simple life used to be. 
My grandpa died a year ago last Sunday, I thought to myself he was one helluva' man (he was a helluva man), 
And I know when the darkness surrounds me,
He reaches out and he takes my hand.

No matter what I do, you don't care what I say
I can't hide the pain anymore

I gave up on Nashville a long time ago
Yeah, but here I go, Lord, once again, here I go

Now, I don't need to be too rich
I'm just an old, hard-headed, son of a bitch
My eyes are still set way back on my glory days
Back in the time of the Dukes of Hazzard
I was listenin' to Willie and old Merle Haggard
Smilin' just a little, as I poked along in my truck

There's a lot of poor folks in my situation
With the years of heartache and frustration
Kinda watching as the dreams turn into years

Let me tell you, folks, it don't really matter
That beer you're drinkin' never really makes you any fatter
It's all those nights on the couch with a TV dinner
After twelve years with the Copenhagen
Well, I finally found out that I was mistaken
It's not gonna be something to add the years to my life

That shit is gonna kill you if the women don't get you first

A hundred miles from nowhere with all a girl could need

And if I had a speed plane we'd fly across the land
Settle in some little border town
We'd drink margaritas and dance to mariachis
Put you on my speed plane, and I would bring you back home

And if I had a steamboat we'd sail across the ocean
Dock in some little port of call
We would have a fine time with Swiss cheese and French wine
Put you on my steamboat, and I would bring you back home

But I ain't got a million, and I ain't got a speed plane
I ain't got no boat upon the sea

Pat Green,"I was born down in San Antone; daddy would leave us all alone
Big rig, rolling thunder on a Dallas bound highway, home
Mama got a job, and she worked real hard
She had two little kids in a trashed out car
Yeah, but me and my brother seemed to get along just fine

[Chorus]
Yeah, and you know the highway, just like a river, keeps rolling on
And you know it's my way.  I was born to sing this song
Have no fear, I ain't going nowhere
Everything is gonna be just fine

So I turn on the TV on a Sunday afternoon
This preacher was saying: ""boy, you're gonna meet your doom
If you do to the honky-tonks and drink that ice cold beer."" 
Well, I've got me some friends, and we're real tight
We stay up drinking and talking in the middle of the night
We talk about Jesus, man; I'll tell you he's one pretty cool dude

[Chorus]

Lately I've been toying with the notion
Of setting these wheels in motion
Set me out on the highway to see what I can see
Then you came in crying; you were bitching at me
You said your baby or the highway; now what's it gonna' be?
I said well, maybe you don't get it, it's the nature of the business
And I'm 'bout to be moving on

[Chorus]",Just Fine,1999
Pat Green,"Me and Billy the Kid, we never got along. I didn't like the way he cocked his 
Hat and he wore his gun all wrong. We had the same girlfriend and he never 
Forgot it. She had a qute little chiwawa 'till one day he up and shot it. He 
Road the hard country, down the New Mexico line. He had a silver pocket watch 
He never did wind. He crippled a piano player for playin his favorite song. Yah 
Me and Billy the Kid, we never got along.

Me and Billy the Kid, we never got along. I didn't like the way he buckled his 
Belt and wore his gun all wrong. He was bad to the bone, all hopped up on 
Speed. I would'a left him alone if it weren't for that sinorita, but he gave 
Her silver and he paid her hotle bills. It was knew that she loved him she said 
She always will. Well I'd go and see her, whenever Billy was gone. Yah Me and 
Billy the Kid, we never got along.

Yah Me and Billy the Kid, we never got along. I didn't like the way he tied his 
Shoes and he wore his gun all wrong. One day I told Billy man I got this 
Foolproof scheme, we're gonna rob the Wells fargo, she's bustin at the seams. 
Well I new that I'd framed him but didn't feel bad, cause the way that I was 
Livin was drivin me mad. Billy went for his gun, but his gun was on all wrong. 
Yah Me and Billy the Kid, we never got along.

Yah Me and Billy the Kid, we never got along. I sure liked the way he swayed in 
The wind when I played his favorite song. And my girlfriend sings harmony to La 
Cuca Racha. We sit and wind that pocket watch and we pet her new chiwawa. 
Moved into a hotel, got a room with a shower. I lie and listen to that watch

I dreamed that Texas was burnin' down, burnin' down.
And all the old people I'd grown up to love
Were leaving town.

So I cried ""Oh Moses, bring a flood from the Red Red Sea
Bring back Towns Van Zandt and my heroes back to me.
'Cause I can play their songs but it ain't the way they do,
It ain't the way they do.""

I had a nightmare, a nightmare, it was a nightmare.

Now Buddy Holly was ridin' on the wind.
Stevie Ray well he was too.
And when their star came tumbling to the ground
Wasn't a thing all the king's horses and all the king's men could do.

Me I just got my old barstool.
Man it's burnin' me down, it's burnin' me down.
Just like a brushfire that burns on through the night
One of these days how it's going
One of these days I'm gonna' burn on out.

Silver haired and he's still there 
Under a sky so warm and fair

Sitting in a shallow creek

I know damn well it ain't where I belong, 
Think I'll quit my job come 5 o'clock,

Do you really want to leave me here alone, 
I said I'm staring at this ocean full of Heineken drinking Yankees 
I'd rather be in Texas on my own

So we were southbound 35, we were headed down the road, 
Hit the border by the morning, let Texas fill my soul, 
Yeah let Texas fill my soul.
Come on let's go! 

The tears start to flow about the time that I was leaving, 
She said I guess you better take me along, 
God might have made her born a little Yankee child, 
But it's time that I made Texas my home, 
So we loaded her stuff into my pickup, 
Said good-bye to all my friends, 
Called my brother down in Austin Texas, 
Said I'm headed home again.

There'll be those nights when glory comes 'round

Saw a beggar pickin' up some cans
Saw a little boy who had some songs in his eyes
Reachin' out for his mama's hand
Watched a stranger give that man a dollar
Watched the mama wipe the tears from the little boy's eyes
And then I stared up to the heavens
Said ""Oh Lord I'm glad that I'm alive,
Glad that I'm alive""

And daddy left, 
And momma cried, again. 
I spent my nights cleaning Ruby's floors.

And the farmers bitched, 
We're no good at football anymore. 

In this land that knows no laughter, 
And this land that holds no water,

With Ruby's two sad daughters. 

One went way out west, 
One went way wrong. 
One left at seventeen, 
And the other couldn't wait that long. 
Neither went anywhere with me.

Yeah I like Texas, Ain't it fine here,
Like to pick my guitar down in Luckenbach, and drink that Shiner Bock beer, 
Yeah I like Texas, man there ain't no doubt, 
just listen to me 'cause I know what I'm talkin' about.

Well there's old dancehalls and little cafe's, where you can get a taste of the Lone Star State, strap on your boots and have yourself a laugh or two, well there's no line dancin' just straight romancin', that hill country lore is what I fancy, where streams run clear and Lord the skies they are so blue.

Pat Green,"Tree blows against my window
There's a storm brewin' in my heart
Watchin' credits roll on a late night TV show
Lonely street light peekin' 
Through the cracks in the window shade
After all that he's seen, I wonder if he truly knows

Did he watch her when she slammed the door
Like a hammer against a nail
Leavin' me in what's become 
A lonely prison cell?

I thought always meant forever
Guess you couldn't play second fiddle to my guitar
Like an old man drinkin' down at the tavern
I was one for the road; now you're headed on back home

I met you at a party, seems like only yesterday
We were fallin' in love and livin' to chase our dreams
I gave you flowers on Valentine's
And I had a strong feelin' deep and down inside
That someday we'd make a home and a family

I'd say I'm sorry in a heartbeat
If you would only let me
I could learn to forgive if you would only forget
A hotel room down in Austin
After another one night show
I caught your silhouette creepin' down the street 
Under a moonlight glow

And as you took my hand 
So went all my pain
We stepped right off the platform and caught the midnight train

And I thought always meant forever
And I won't make you play second fiddle to my guitar
Like an old man drinkin' down at the tavern
I was one for the road, and you headed on back home",One for the Road,2001
Pat Green,"September come to Texas just one time every year, so we get our guns and our
Pickup trucks, and a bunch of that Lone Star beer, well we head out for the
Open plains, where the birds they all flow like wine, we hunt them up then we
Shoot them down, man it makes me feel so fine, The manly sport is what I'm
Talking about, so you can grab you a pouch of chew, If we get bored 'cause the
Birds won't fly, we'll shoot the rabbits with my .22.

I don't wanna go to Paris, I get enough French will my fries,
Just send me on down to Abilene, for the huntingman's paradise,

Hunting is a lot like religion or so it is I'm told, they're both just a simple
Little way of life, and they're both good for your soul, from Robert Earl Keen
To Robert E. Lee, perfect strangers or best of friends, we all have a common
Little bond between us we were born to be huntin' men, If it flies it dies or

Take mine, and we'll have us a Bar-B-Que.

Pat Green,"Adios days on the wide open prairie
Nights in the canyon are gone
Steven is dead, Johnny got married
and me I'm here all on my own
I'm all on my own

Used to have nights on the town of Loredo
Spinning them girls 'cross the floor
Now I'm too old for dancing
Too far gone for the whiskey
so I don't go down there no more

Now it's adios days on the wide open prairie
Nights in the canyon are gone

and me I'm here all on my own

My dad was a top hand
When he was a young man
He road for the Diamond Bar Jade 
He pushed all day long 
From the back of his pony
At night time he'd gather the streets

He hated the cities
Cussed all the railroads
Said they would lead us to fall
Now we have street cars
Cowboys dying
Guess he weren't too far from wrong

Pat Green,"My daddy was an outlaw
Mom died giving birth to me
They both left me all alone when I was on bended knee
If you don't like my story I suggest you turn the page
I don't need no preachin' I ain't got no soul to save

My name is Arkansas Dave Rudebaugh
And this here's Tennessee Jack
Don't you give us any lip now boy
Or today will be your last
When the bank was dry we said goodbye and walked out to the street
When a cloud of bullets came tumbling down 
And took Tennessee to his knees

I just stood there and watched him bleeding
Like a fool out in the rain
Didn't have time to think as I jumped through the banks front window pane
Grabbed the teller in the blink of an eye and put a Colt up to his head
Said careful son don't you try to run or tomorrow you'll wake up dead

[Chorus]
I've got to fly just like an eagle
Free like a bird on the wind
Hell fire and brimstone are comin' down on me
Mister I was born of sin

Sat down in the corner and I rolled a little home grown
Said if I'm gonna die today I sure as hell ain't goin' alone
So I ran out the bank shootin' I was two for two at first
Then I felt a painful sound as a bullet tore my shirt

[Chorus]

I crawled back to the alleyway where I knew my horse was tied
And that's where all the legends say Arkansas Dave Rudebaugh died
But I was in a place so far from there in a time so long ago
In the arms of a pretty little senorita on the Gulf of Mexico

And(But) I sing all the songs of America
Danced in the rain in Lafayette
I'm still hanging out with John Wayne and Jesus
And I know this is good as life can get

Stanley was a trucker by his trade,

It would go and make old Stanley's day.

They'd drink a couple beers, 
Roll a couple spares, 
Then it's off to the trailer, 
Willie Nelson all the way.

Yeah life here in the trailer park is fine, 
You know that we've been living it everyday, 
I got me a good looking woman I got me some indoor plumbing,

We got the hurricane package, 
With the tires up on the roof, 
A satellite dish out back,

Couple days just hiding from the sun.
Good with the cards and
Good with the dice

But what it all made it just a little bit more today
But all the luck you have is just the bills you left unpaid

All the good things fade away.

Seems sure to me there has to be
Such a thing as the good ol' days
Some day somewhere my hair like my memories
Will all just fade out to gray

Cause there's nothing but pain out there
I heard you say something about the cross upon your back
The truth is, baby, life ain't always fair
Your whole life is water running down a sidewalk
You Followed the rocks and the cracks as you crawl cross the ground
I ain't seen you smile in so long
You must of built a house in the misery you found

I'm tired, I'm tired now
Tired of playing the same old game
You got to get yourself together
Say to yourself I ain't going down this way
I ain't going down this way

Sifting through your memories deep in the ground with the dead
Maybe you were high on the top of the cloud with the dragon that lives in your head
Maybe you were dragging your wagon with your thoughts like old wooden toys
Maybe you were looking for something that you lost when you were a boy

You eat when your hungry
You sleep when your sleepy
You drink like there's a hole in your soul
All of your problems are begging to leave
But you never want to let them go

Then I'd take out some of your livestock

And drop them to the bottom if a black lagoon

My very spine shudder and squirm
I only hope that I've learned from my sin

Got baptized, washed up clean
But the world has a way, if you know what I mean
To scuff you up again and again

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing
Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry

Now, somebody made every natural thing
From the soul, inside out to Saturn's rings
How my baby smiles and how Ray Charles sings
Of course we were created
The clouds make rain, the ocean makes sand
The earth breathes fire, and lava makes land
Now that took a mighty hand
And a wild imagination

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing
Or how a man in chains has the strength to sing
Just one thing is clear to me
There's always more than what appears to be
And when the light's just right
I swear I see poetry

The dreams I dreamed came back ten-fold
The friends I have, the woman I hold
I look down and I'm on streets of gold
After all the mud along the way
And sometimes the big old mystery
Just leans right on me
And whispers that I'm home and I am free
And I'll take that any day

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing

Hands like steel
From a lifetime spent in the cotton fields
Though he'd come home tired and dirty
Almost every night
He found the strength to smile at me and hold my mama tight
While that old transistor radio would play the op'ry out in the hall
I'd sit and watch their shadows glide across the wall

And they'd dance to a Dixie lullaby
Picture of love beneath the southern sky
Oh my, what a beautiful life
Just like a Dixie lullaby

I left home at eighteen
In a hand me down Chevrolet
Packed my mamas goodness and my old man's stubborn ways
It was college, work, and love
Then the babies came
The youngest one's got his granddaddy's name
And in the early morning hours when my children could not sleep
I'd rock them in my arms to a simple beat

And I'd sing them a Dixie lullaby
Hush, baby, don't you start to cry
Oh my, what a beautiful life
Just like a Dixie lullaby

My father was a mountain of a man
That was the description that I gave
The morning that we laid him in his grave
There with my mama by his side, we said our last goodbye
To a man we thought would never die
As I stood there in the fields of amazing grace
Oh, how the tears ran down my face

And I sang him a Dixie lullaby

Where we grew up, where we hung out
I've Been on this highway for three hours now
And I'm trying to find it
And I remember an old pinball arcade
Where Where I lived out all my yesterdays
And I'm sure it's torn down and gone away
But I'm trying to find it
And there's a feeling that I left behind
I felt it once running down my spine
The fear of God the joy of life
And I'm trying to find it

There's a spot on earth a man can go
To find himself and free his soul
A place somewhere between hell and heaven
Where no one hurts and all's forgiven
A door that leads to light and grace
But the keys are in the darkest place
Though it feels like I've been there before
Though I don't know what I'm looking for
And I'm trying to find it

There's an attic in my old mans house
Full of history I need to know about
Of a life I've lived too long without
And I'm trying to find it

And I know you're up there in your room
And I want so bad to heal the wound
But I've hurt you in so many ways
And I don't know why you choose to stay
And I know it's me that let it die
And there's a fire that's gone when I look in your eyes
An innocence that you once had
A piece of you I miss so bad
And I'm trying to find it

Well It's three AM and I'm on my knees

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same

Silly but it's true

Beginning in a dew

But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get

Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette
 
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances

And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep

Or laugh until I cry

Altogether we could get it solved (get it solved)

A sin higher, make profit like Jeremiah
Turn the mercury to gold to extract worth
And my circumference trying to tell me it's a flat Earth
Elegant aggression, glamorous suppression
Ballad of the bullet, immaculate conception
And the shitty slums seeking galaxy connections
Trying to follow God, hollow like a faulty log
Han Solo in the Jedi, I'm unthawed
Hyper-vigilant and militant, en garde
Unscathed, slaves free while they unchained
Life's a maze, fiends live in concaves

I raised a glass when you swallowed your forked tongue
I recognize your counterfeit confidence

There's no such thing as a typical individual
There's nothing left except ""fuck you"" on principle

Smoking like an ember, drinking like an amateur
Tripping like your grandpa at the strip club without his pills
Make it rain two dollar bills

Yo, peep the piece of scum, you proceeded to become
Competing with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk
You must be drinking cum, 'cause you talk a lot like a cunt
Get punched and knocked out in the crosswalk right in the front
Your resistance is food for my machismo
When I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode
That ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul
I ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul
Everybody else telling me I needed to grow
Shut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl
Got some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell
So pass the bill fast, 'cause I over pressurize my master seal
Don't over glamorize a man to kill
Don't let 'em grow up, thinking he has to actually blast to steal
And make sure they know there's more to life than just some rap skill
It's like decades later emcees get trapped still

Power to the people
Don't let a coward lead you
Can't preach to you if they don't know how to feed you
I burnt the haystack and found the needle
Then proceed to, invest in water, cows, and diesel
And sour diesel, wholesale banana trucks
Hotels in Panama, no dope sales, we're manning up
Unplug the cord, debug the store
We love the lord, but keep getting drug into war
What's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking
What are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?
The diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right
Or, we can set it off like dynamite

No godly love, but there is always a daily grace
And nothing could erase each night's horrible traces

Yet they talk about love, they talk about love
They talk about love, they talk about love, love, love, sweet love

Day in, day out, the nation fights for more power (brotherly love)
But it's easier to write a story in a longer hour
No brotherly love, no sisterly love for their own
And it took a miracle to put love into heritage

And mail it right away

Remember me as a sunny day
That you once had, along the way
Didn't I inspire you a little higher
Remember me as a funny clown
That made you laugh when you were down
Didn't I boy, didn't I boy

Remember me as a big balloon
At a carnaval that ended too soon
Remember me as a breath of spring
Remember me as a good thing

Bye baby, see you around
I already know about the new love you've found
What can I do but wish you well
What we had was really swell
I won't forget it, I have no regrets

Remember me as a sound of laughter
And my face the morning after
Didn't the sky beckon us to fly?
Yes, you'l remember the times we fought
But don't forget me in your tender thoughts
Please darlin' oh yeah

Remember me when you drink the wine
Of sweet succes and I gave you my best
Remember me every song you sing
Remember me as a good thing

How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You,1995
Pat McGee,"The brighter thing get to realize your dreams
Brings all the whole world to judge on your scene
I'm trying to ask you to open up your senses
To all the fine things that tear down the fences
Put up by, and kept by those who don't always listen
To what the father told you they won't be missing
Out and down on this child's intervention
This boy never meant nothing but just to give you

All about the passion
All about the passion
All about the passion
All about the passion

Extra, now extra; won't you read all about it?
Seems you've grown up, turned your life around it
Don't judge him on what the others might say
You'll be asking him for just one thing some other day
He's tryin', he's buyin', he's got himself a time
And it looks like, and it feels like he's doing fine
So won't you stay back off his line?
This boy never meant nothing but just to give you

People, now people, won't you please understand?
This child's not thinking about what others chance
The rain's pouring down on him like harsh blowing sand
Blinding game of darkness; it's no wonder he ran
Back to the old school, right now if they see him though
They know that he's brewing up a fresh batch of home stew
Now they'll sit back and if they only knew
This boy never meant nothing but just to give you",Passion,1997
Pat McGee,"As I lie here in bed, your smile fills my head
And I'm using this pen to talk to you, from a southern way
It's been weeks since I've seen you last
The time away from you ain't moving too fast
Wishing my summer away just to see you again

[Chorus]
I'm there by your side, lookin' in your eyes
Seeing you with me, what else could there be?
If I could get away, I'd be there today
You'd be wearing that smile
Haven't seen for a while
Haven't seen for a while

Wake up everyday, go through the same routine
Go to work, come home
What does it all really mean?
Check the mail just hoping to find
Another note from you would ease my mind
It's five-fifteen
I can picture you driving home from your same old scene
In five you'll hear the phone ringing
Have to settle for talking again

[Chorus]

I can picture you now
You're standing outside your house
The breeze is blowing off your northern shore
I'm loving you more
I long for the days when there's no goodbyes
Wish I could see you
I'd wipe the tears from your eyes
Tell you everything's all right, lay you down
Say to you goodnight

Pat McGee,"Who's got all the answers to questions that Rebecca has? 
She's been cluelessly wondering just how long she's been had
She knows more than you or me, and she never thinks she's wrong
It seems the tables are turning; she found herself hurting for, oh, so long

Does anybody out there want to help Rebecca find a clue to life?
I guess she feels she was the victim, and we are the knife
There is a price to pay when you put on that face and roll the dice
One day soon you'll realize the world ain't that nice

Are you alright, and are you okay? 
Didn't anybody ever give a care around your way? 
Will you be alright after we go? 
Won't you tell me someday?

Everybody knows you can't read the writing on the wall 
So don't come in
Even you and I know you can't 
And you won't want to start this thing all over again

Why don't you just drive on down that line?
'Cause we don't have to let you in
Well, you seem to think you know it all
Let me tell you something: you can't win

Hey, Rebecca, this is your pilot speaking 
And you're about to land
I hope you got all your answers

Wants to get a straight answer, and roll on by

She'll be ragin' inside you, looks like another fight
Backed up and burned out, like a flame at both ends

And you really never do
Til when the day comes, she's leavin you

Wish I could see you, id wipe the tears from your eyes
Tell you everything's all right, lay you down
Say to you goodnight

I'm there by your side, lookin in your eyes
Seeing you with me, what else could there be?

Alone I wait for you, I feel I should
Maybe just possibly you'll turn your head
And look at me the way the angels would
I'm thinkin' 'bout you and I could burn these times
These times and let our souls act out the only way
Under the running sky, colors fade into the night
Holding back this day

I have lost myself in only you
Hold on through
I am the one who still burns for you, burns for you

Thinkin' 'bout yesterday, the sun went down
Painted there you lie into the sea
I wish I were next to you lying there
Breathing from my heart and how I feel
We drift into a distant place, desire is the
Only one we know who feels the same
The moon is up and the sun is up
And the sky bleeds over our hearts, pih this day, push the day

I guess it was yesterday, complete me
Surround me in your eyes, you hold me still

Turned us upside down into the sun, to the sun, right now",Lost,2005

She's tired of waiting
She only wants what she deserves
There's no escaping
THe fact that she's older and life's turning colder
She's finding it hard to stay warm

After the stars fall down
And there's nothing for wishing on 
After the good-bye sound
And love leaves her alone
She picks herself up off the ground
She won't bow down
She's come too far to give up now

Her friends all think it's so sad
She must be lonely
She cannot help sometimes but laugh
She knows they're only
Trying to help her
But if they really knew her
They'd know she's comin' into her own

She's not owing nobody
She just wants the simple life
Where they all leave her alone

Does anybody out there want to help Rebecca find a clue to life; 
I guess she feels she was the victim and we are the knife.

Pat Metheny,"How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely

Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say
What can you say
When a love affair is over

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone
With a memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look
How she must have asked
Could I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to do
What can one do
When a love affair is over",Insensatez (How Insensitive),1998
Pat Metheny,"A insensatez que você fez
Coração mais sem cuidado
Fez chorar de dor
O seu amor
Um amor tão delicado
Ah, porque você foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade
Quem semeia vento, diz a razão
Colhe sempre tempestade
Vai, meu coração pede perdão
Perdão apaixonado
Vai porque quem não
Pede perdão
Não é nunca perdoado",Insensatez,2000

Pat Metheny,"The sound that you're listenin' to
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame

I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright",Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,2001

The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby

You know you done me wrong baby
You'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
The thrill gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season

For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

Pat Metheny Group,"Well I was raised up by the golden rule
In an old house with a patched up roof
We had a hard home but it pulled us close
We were family

Oh that summer when the crops all died
Was the first time I saw Daddy cry
An' I heard Momma say what goes on here stays
In the family

[CHORUS:]
Well our clothes weren't new, that old car was used
We held our own
Whoa you just can't buy, that sense of pride
We grew up on, In the family

I remember every Sunday night
After supper round the firelight
How peaceful Daddy looked
As he read the good book
In the family

Well, some folks said we were barely makin' do
We were better off than they ever knew
We never had much but we sure had love
In the family",In Her Family,1987
Pat Metheny Group,"There's a cross on the side of the road
Where a mother lost a son
How could she know that the morning he left
Would be their last time she'd trade with him for a little more time
So she could say she loved him one last time
And hold him tight
But with life we never know

When we're coming up to the end of the road
So what do we do then
With tragedy around the bend?

[Chorus ]
We live we love
We forgive and never give up
'cause the days we are given are gifts from above
Today we remember to live and to love
We live we love
We forgive and never give up
'cause the days we are given are gifts from above
Today we remember to live and to love

There is a man who waits for the tests
To see if the cancer has spread yet
And now he asks, ""So why did I wait to live till it was time to die?""
If I could have the time back how I'd live
Life is such a gift
So how does the story end?
Well this is your story and it all depends
So don't let it become true
Get out and do what we are meant to do

[Chorus ]

Waking up to another dark morning
People are mourning
The weather in life outside is storming
But what would it take for the clouds to break
For us to realize each day is a gift somehow, someway
So get our heads up out of the darkness
And spark this new mindset and start to live life 'cause it ain't gone yet
And tragedy is a reminder to take off the blinders
And wake up and live the life we're supposed to take up
Moving forward with all our heads up 'cause life is worth living

She just likes to use her night light
When she gets paid
True religion gets it all if they fit right

She's a little bit manic, completely organic
Doesn't panic for the most part
She's old enough to know
And young enough not to say no

To any chance that she gets
For home plate tickets to see the Mets
Like everybody, she's in over her head
Dreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds

She's a Gemini-Capricorn
Thinks all men are addicted to ****
I don't agree with her half the time
But ****, I'm glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She got the kinda strength
That every man wishes he had
She loved Michael Jackson
Up until he made 'Bad'

Tells me that she lived about a hundred lives
Scares me to death when she thinks and drives
Says cowboy hats make her look fat
And I'm so glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go

And doesn't care where we're goin' to

And most all your would be friends

And rearrange

Or how to stop

Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I wasted so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
T'Leave it lay just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find it gone

Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through

There's only you
And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange piece of mind
Without it there'd be

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you

And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town.
Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat,
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5, 
who's shy that's the kind of man I need because I'm free.

Sur cett' boul' qu'on appell' : la Terre...
Et mêm' les gens qu'nous admirons
N'sont pas à l'abri d'la misère...
C'est ainsi qu'dans l'milieu, l'aut' jour,
A midi juste à la pendule,
Ce bruit affreux n'a fait qu'un tour :
On a fauché la bague à Jules !

REFRAIN
Jul's, c'est un caïd, un' terreur,
Mais un malin, presqu'un artiste...
Un gars qui n'fait jamais d'erreurs,
Un' min' d'or pour les journalistes...
Pour un' fois qu'il s'faisait masser
De l'orteil à la clavicule,
Complèt'ment nu, comm' vous pensez,
On a fauché la bague à Jules :

Un' petit' bagu' de rien du tout :
Deux cents gramm's d'or autour d'un diam,
Des p'tits rubis un peu partout...
Seul'ment la bagu' lui v'nait d'Madame !
Ou plutôt, de son ton guindé,
Aux demoisell's qui déambulent,
Elle avait dit : c'est décidé,
On va offrir la bague à Jules.

D'la s'couss' les pépées des carr'fours
Les cell's que la moral' tolère
Les bell's de nuit, les bell's de jour,
Les faux poids et les vraies douairières,
Tout's ont augmenté leurs tarifs
Afin d'arrondir leur pécule...
Y'a eu du marathon sportif
Pour alourdir la bague à Jules !

Hélas, depuis qu'on a fauché
L'ornement d'son auriculaire,
La clientèle peut s'approcher,
Fini, l'moindre effort pour lui plaire...
Et malheur au gars qui dirait
Comm' ça bêtement, sans préambule :
"" Pardon, mad'moisell', c'est-y vrai
Qu'on a fauché la bague à Jules ? ""

REFRAIN
Et Jul's lui mêm', c'est pire encor...
Il os' plus dir' bonjour aux potes
Il sait plus quoi fair' de son corps...
Quand il est tout seul, il sanglote...
Tous les tantôts, dès qu'il est l'vé,
D'un air penaud et ridicule,
Il va voir aux objets trouvés
Si y'aurait pas la bague à Jules.


Tenez , l'aut'soir, n'en pouvant plus,
Tremblant comme un qu'à la jaunisse
Et cachant ses gros doigts poilus,
Il est allé à la police...
Et là, au commissair' soufflé,
Il a dit : "" Tant pis, c'est régule,
Y'aura un sac pour le poulet
Qui ramèn'ra la bague à Jules !...

REFRAIN
Et pendant c'temps là, pas bien loin,
L'imbécil' qu'a fauché la bague
Se consol' tout seul, dans son coin,
De l'énormité de la blague...
Car sa loup' lui a révélé
La vérité sur le bidule...
Dans l'histoire tout l'monde est volé :
Elle était fauss' la bague à Jules !...",La  Bague a Jules,

Mais les autr's femmes de la commune
Privées d'leurs époux, d'leurs galants
Accumulèrent la rancune
Patiemment
Puis un jour ivres de colère
Elles s'armèrent de bâtons
Et farouches elles immolèrent
Le chaton
La bergère après bien des larmes
Pour s'consoler prit un mari
Et ne dévoila plus ses charmes
Que pour lui
Le temps passa sur les mémoires
On oublia l'évènement
Seul des vieux racontent encore
A leurs p'tits enfants

Patachou,"Venez, vous dont l'œil étincelle 
Pour entendre une histoire encor 
Approchez: je vous dirai celle 
De doña Padilla del Flor 
Elle était d'Alanje, où s'entassent 
Les collines et les halliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il est des filles à Grenade 
Il en est à Séville aussi 
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade 
A l'amour demandent merci 
Il en est que parfois embrassent 
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole 
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla 
Car jamais prunelle espagnole 
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla 
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent 
Les filles sous les peupliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Elle prit le voile à Tolède 
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu 
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide 
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu 
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent 
Les soudards et les écoliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée 
Amour en son cœur s'installa 
Un fier brigand de la contrée 
Vint alors et dit : ""Me voilà!"" 
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent 
En audace les chevaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il était laid : les traits austères 
La main plus rude que le gant 
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères 
Et la nonne aima le brigand 
On voit des biches qui remplacent 
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

La nonne osa, dit la chronique 
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit 
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique 
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit 
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent 
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or quand, dans la nef descendue 
La nonne appela le bandit 
Au lieu de la voix attendue 
C'est la foudre qui répondit 
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent 
Les amants par Satan liés 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Cette histoire de la novice 
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut 
Qu'afin de préserver du vice 
Les vierges qui font leur salut 
Les prieurs la racontassent 
Dans tous les couvents réguliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers",La Legende de la Nonne,2001

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

And was playing soft

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

I say if I had one of these girls as my companion
We'd be looking at all the stars under the banyan
Been all around the world and see what them countries got to offer
Love what I see, but it don't impress me 'cause island girls is lookin' more proper
So ? talkin' you, you number one
Favorite common island, mon
So I be sendin' all my love to the princess of the sea

Pati,"This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye",Kiss and Say Goodbye,2004

Pati Yang,"There was something in the sky that day. 
I remember. 
Prisoners around got scared at once 
Collisions of hunger spread in cause of rain 
For once empty shops filled with 
Feared human beings 
And someone said: 
(Holly mother lost her pearl necklace) 
One little drop 
Dropped on my face 
And the second one 
Dropped on my six year old friend's 
All of a sudden 
Some huge hand grabbed us 
I slipped 
But my friend stayed 
And was taken with the crowd 
Voices of panic were heard everywhere around 
And one of them came from my mother's mouth 
As she saw me 
Dancing in the rain 
With my hands up 
Couldn't just figure out it's funny acid taste",1986,2005
Pati Yang,"Air stands still 
And I can't move 
Time has stopped 
At one look through 
Colors fade the walls out loud 

Something inside me says: 
I am still waiting for the hurricane 
And where is the missing piece 

You have taken it 
And a part of me 

Downstairs scares me 
Outside sounds like ghosts are 
Quietly playing vibes 
Days in shape of hide me, please

With empty tears 

Home has the echo as a friend 
So I leave the bed unmade 
All day",Air Stands Still,2005

Only the head counts 
She's the only one that has something to tell 
And that happens,
Just like that

She's the only one that knows 
The secret gate 
To the garden at the bottom",Easy Flow,2005
Pati Yang,"Did you see your angel? 
Did you see 
The one 
Pouring dust over you shoulder 
When you cried, 
The city cried 
The lights went off 
The day before 
All papers called, 
That your tears went missing 
And therefore 
From now on the city was freed from the miracle 
Did you asked questions? 
About how many more days forward 
How many evil intentions 
All the unusual people 
On ordinary missions 
Everyone seems to know but us 
I trust my eyes 
And this is not happening 
I make a list everyday, but it fades 
Must be the see through int in my veins 
Say it now change your mind call my day a sunny night 
Live a dream forever after 
I'll take care of your disaster 
Make it back on the track sugar sweet no defeat 
For no reason there's no water 
Only bites, virtually rotten 
Did you dance your town away 
All the way down to the river? 
Did you marry the moonlight? 
Have you ever forgiven? 
Did you burry your past 
Fought till the last drop blessed your face? 
Since then 
The days 
Went all uneven 
Everyone seems to know but us, 
Is that how it goes? 
I trust my eyes, and this is not happening, 
You tell me: aren't my senses failing? 
Is it the skin that I am in that breaks my heart in two 
And makes my fingers grin on you 
When we dance 

My toes scream to yours 
And the noise brings down our home 
In ruin 
We're fooling with dogs 
That speak human 
And as if that wasn't enough 
I think I am turning into A giant cat woman 
How many more days forward 
How many daylight robberies 
Did you pick up the money and run, honey? 
Be honest",Giant Cat Woman,2005
Pati Yang,"This song was meant to hurt 
Was meant to be 
About the broken world 
In a broken girl 
These words 
I found written on my window 
By the L the lipstick dead 
I thought I've seen her crying 
I thought she ran too fast 
I thought I'd make her stop 
But I just stood there, 
Watched her fight 
If I could live it one more time 
Reverse the day 
Back to where I begun 
Leaving my memories behind 
I'd draw a brand new history 
A brand new me 
I breathe slower 
As the fever comes 
And takes away the stream of useless words 
(No need to explain) 
I dive deeper 
Though I cannot swim 
Air and water seems the same 
Everything makes perfect sense 
Lips against the heart 
Heart against the will 
Toes beyond the sky 
Hand beyond the reach 
If I could live it one more time 
Reverse the day 
Back to where I begun 
Leaving my memories behind

And the rock seems hard",Reverse the Day,2005

Half stairs up 
I stopped: too fast 
Maybe the key will turn

With tens of voices

Soul for me a little 
Before the soul is gone 
Shake a little 
And speak a little more 
Soul for me a little 
Feel a little 
If you can feel at all 
I thought: 
On three 
The miracle would become real 
Isn't that what you said? 

And then left 
Since the door has shut 
The silence screams 
Against the only prayer I've had:

Even my bed is cold 
Naked I seat down and break in tears 
So hysterical 
Tearing off the pillows of past 
I bet all neighbors have heard me before 
Can't beat another sleepless night 
Does it have to go on? 
Carry on finding pieces of me on the streets 
It's only when I loose myself 
And it won't stop raining 
Chasing days on the runaway 
From the deep burning 
It's only when I fade away 
And the fever stays 
Water is gonna have to be 
Once more the substitute for milk 
I close my eyes: 
I think they've seen enough, 
Light hurts: 
Can anyone switch off the sun?",Switch Off the Sun,2005
Pati Yang,"The sun says that this is for my good 
Only till I am back inside 
Licking wounds until I can see through 
This shadeless heart 
And clouds in shape of you

I cry hard

Just like a tree that plant by the rivers of water
I will surely grow.
Everyday I kneel and pray
that Jah will guide me on my way.
I wanna be good yes I wanna do right
and I don't want to go astray.
People tell me yes they do
they say Pato Banton we love you.
That's why I want to dedicate this song
to everyone of you.
To every friend and every fan
and every radio D. J. too.
Every reggae reporter, producer, promoter
I'd just like to say thank you.
And all the youth I stand and salute
for staying loyal to the reggae roots.
They give me the strength to push on through
because they tell me to: Go Pato!

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of 

Groovin', down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do

There's always lots of things that we can see
We can be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just

When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'

But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

Por muito tempo não consigo esperar
Quase sempre ser feliz
É um alento ou uma falta de are
Capaz de me fazer
Um pouco acreditar
Que o sonho mais perfeito
Pode se realizar

Tudo parece igual
As sombras são as medidas
De tantas chances perdidas
Sem demora então
É só acreditar
Que o sonho mais perfeito
Pode se realizar

Onde vou você sempre me vê

O mundo é um grande pão com manteiga café com leite
Nunca mais, nunca mesmo sobre qualquer assunto
Obtemperarei...assim espero
Porque sei calcular o valor de um amor que desponta
Eu meço pelo tamanho da dor
Que no final eu sei que vai sobrar
É preciso dizer, é preciso dizer
Ié, ié, ié, ié, ié, ié, ié
Tá na hora, tá na hora
Todo mundo foi embora e eu sobrei
Aqui feito um bobo só pensando nela
Já soprei a vela e vou deitar
Até as pernas melhorar
Vou voltar a caminhar
E se Deus quiser Ele vai me chamar
Eu também quero e eu vou, eu vou
Eu também quero e eu vou, eu vou

Here from the edge of my worst fears
Life's but a dream
Metal is the only thing
That sounds louder
Than the voice I hear
Inside of me
Day and night
Night and day
Screaming!
Fudido! Fudido! Fudido! Fudido!
Listen to the door bell
Pretend you're in a tunnel
Crying as a train goes by
Flying with the Jetsons
Listen to the clock tic-tac

Não faço conta do tempo perdido
Que o tempo só passa
Não volta pra trás
Não leio as linhas
As linhas são retas
Os versos, poemas
Dilemas são mais
Os contos disfarçam
A vida sofrida, corrida
Dos nossos velhos pobres pais
Não corto as cordas
Porque sobre elas estão os meus pés
Me admira o céu é o limite
Destino, castigo em qualquer lugar
Bendito seja com toda certeza

Não há ó gente ó não

Quanta força

Terra boa que Deus deu nós
E nóis quer mudar o mundo
Esse mundo é tão perfeitim
Esse mundo é mesmo um amor
Eu levo uma vida imbecil
Zanzando atrás do que é bom
Calculo a carne comida
Controlo o que vai no meu som
Peixinho que mora no mar
Só encontro quando vou pescar
Cê vê que imbecil
Esse mundo é tão perfeitim
Esse mundo é mesmo um amor
Terra boa que Deus deu nóis
E nóis quer mudar o mundo
Quem crê diz que tudo consegue
E em tudo aquilo que cri
Eu cri até que desisti
Desisti porque não consegui

Io che amo solo te

Me diga onde estou
Não há tempo não há nada
Que me faça ser quem sou
Mas sem parar pra pensar
Sigo estradas, sigo pistas pra me achar
Nunca sei o que se passa
Com a manias do lugar
Porque sempre parto antes
Que comece a gostar de ser igual, qualquer um
Me sentir mais uma peça no final
Cometendo um erro bobo, decimal
Na verdade continuo sob a mesma condição
Distraindo a verdade, enganando o coração
Pelas minhas trilhas você perde a direção
Não há placa nem pessoas informando aonde vão
Penso outra vez que estou sem meus amigos
E retomo a porta aberta dos perigos

Quando essa joça ficar pronta
Quero ver quem que dá conta
De contar como se conta o dinheirão que vai pro saco
Fazer pirâmide, jardim, não é problema
Bota o nome do Ayrton Senna
Põe na entrada do buraco
Vamos errar português
Vamos eleger um bundão
Vamos votar em quem roubou mas fez
Pena de morte para os linchadores, ou não?
Já que a policia não faz nada
O menininho da calçada
De dia dou moedinha
De noite eu dou porrada
Vamos inventar uma nova dancinha
Sucatear o samba e maltratar o carnaval
Vamos dar um jeito de arrumar a vida
Então vamos morrer de uma vez, tá legal?

Tão lindo amor

A saudade faz sofrer
Não precisa nem querer
Mais e mais
Vou amar você

Não precisa nem querer

Pato Fu,"Dentro do meu carro
A estabilidade
Me faz acreditar
Que está tudo bem
Tudo em seu lugar

E logo me esqueço
Tudo tem seu preço
Aumento a velocidade
E atravesso a cidade
Sem pensar
Sem pensar
Sem pensar

Em mais ninguém
A não ser em quem gosta de mim
Me esqueci numa curva que fiz
Tão veloz que o amor
Não morreu por um triz
Não morreu por um triz

Mas naquela estrada
Naquela madrugada
Acho que matei alguém
E no mesmo instante
Morri um pouco também

Fui até ao rapaz
Que ainda vivia
E vendo ele morrer
Sem saber o que fazer
Segurei sua mão fria

Vi que era pobre
Moço sem instrução
Cheirava a pinga barata
Uma aliança no dedo
Talvez fosse um ladrão

Ajoelhei-me ao seu lado
Me disse o atropelado:
Fiquei com a pior parte
De tudo o que é chamado
Civilização

Devolva este anel
Pra dona daquele bordel
Foi lá que eu roubei
Diga pro dono do bar
Que minha conta encerrei

Silenciou de repente
Gemeu como um cão
E sobre o asfalto quente
Seu sangue escorreu suavemente
Todo pelo chão

Olhei a cidade
Olhei pro meu carro
Voltei a correr
Pensei em fugir
Quis não mais viver

Quis não mais viver
Com mais ninguém
A não ser com quem gosta de mim
Me esqueci numa curva que fiz
Tão veloz que o amor
Não morreu por um triz
Não morreu por um triz

Olhei a cidade
Olhei pro meu carro
Voltei a correr
Pensei em fugir
Quis não mais viver
Quis não mais viver
Quis não mais viver",Um Ponto Oito,2000
Pato Fu,"He wants her love
But never took a shower
He loves her badly
But he does not have a dollar

He listens good
Can´t understand the words
He wants a better life
But life keeps getting worse

He just cannot remember
Anybody´s name
When the situation degenerates
There´s no one to blame

He tries to do things right
He knows he never will

Meu coração
É só de carne
Não tem cimento, não

É só de carne, cuidado
Meu bem, é frágil
Não tem cimento
Dentro do meu coração

Meu coração, cuidado
Não tem cimento
É frágil dentro, meu bem
É só de carne

Não tem cimento, é frágil
Meu bem cuidado
Só tenho carne
Dentro do meu coração

Um amor assim tão frágil
Sempre acha que vai morrer
Só de lhe encostar a mão
Mas ainda vive
E ainda ama a quem lhe faz sofrer

Why el corazón se pone triste contemplando la ciudad
Porque te vas

Como cada noche desperté pensando en ti
Why en mi reloj todas las horas vi passar
Porque te vas

Me olvidaras, me olvidaras
Junto a la estación lloraré igual que un niño
Porque te vas, porque te vas

Bajo la penumbra de un farol se dormirán
Todas las cosas que quedaron por decir se dormirán
Junto a las manillas de un reloj despejarán
Todas las horas que quedaron por vivir esperarán

I will change the world today 
I don't care what the people say 
There's a brighter day to come

Saying fuck the world and just move to an island 
All of these people seek dem neon enlightments 
We are blinded 
World leaders too money minded

Music is my mission and jah works my assignement 
I come from Iceland, Freetown salon, land of diamonds 
We're pushing stones bigger than a girl in the 9th month 
See Americans ah turn the world in a timebomb 
We ain't got no hoods, we have real slums 
Where ten year olds have you leaving 
On two hands with two stumps 
And no clothes and no funds 
I was deep down in a hole giving up my life once 
So insecure I couldn't even see the sky once 
So my energy would grow out of silence 
'how you gonna change the world''- 
I will change it with my hands

And the stars fall from the sky these days

I'm gonna pave the way 
For a brighter day to come 
Cause I'm a rebel I kill the devil 

I failed, I lied, betrayed, got played 
Was scared, was blind, not straight, had hate 
Gone astray, was lost, was vain, loved fame 
But my strength of today lays in yesterday's pain 
I stole, was sold, was bold, I chilled 
I killed, I fell, I rose, you know 
I've lost a fight before 
But I won't lose the war 

[Chorus ]
This ain't about the bad ones 
It's about the one who no care 
Who's too fat to be bothered 
Too lazy and scared 
To whom changing this world 
Would mean send his world to hell 
And destroy an illusion 
That served him so well 
Good things never come easy 
Start with reflection of self 
To some this might sound cheesy 
But the truth afi tell 
Some caught up in survival 
Think it's them that need help 
You never know that material 
Could never be wealth

Suzy there with a man but the man nuh there with me
She flex like hot gal wearing clothes what not fit her
She love fi sussu love the gossip love fi talk
She lost her spark round her everywhere run dark
Now she's all alone wearin' an ocean full a shark
I know a boy name shawn who fa parents love him off
Buck up the wrong set of people now him sit down behind bars
Who fi tell fi act tough now he's all alone

To get along with people sometimes
Me have to wonder
Why me can't
Inna circus of needs and wants
Some lose gravity always inna trance
Come make we break the ceiling now
Get up and go stand this ya chance
Come together we're shining
Above the dark cloud like a silver lining
What's right for you so self defining
Open up your senses and you will find the right timing",Along The Way,2010

People are crying out

Draußen ist Aufruhr, Orient bis Okzident
Nimmt sich Land um Land, Kontinent um Kontinent
Während Al Jazerra, N-TV und Fox es bringen.
Lass ich Gil Scott-Heron aus meinem Boxen klingen
Vom Tahrir zum Plaza del Sol
Auf dem Syntagma skandieren die Massen Parolen
Und es werden immer mehr und sie haben keine Wahl
Schreien Was ist Freiheit,
Die politisch ist und nicht sozial
Und wo die Zukunft,
Die verschütt' geht unter Schuldenbergen
Die sie nie Schultern werden
Und nur an die Jungen vererben.
Irgendwann lässt sich das Dunkel
Nicht mehr bunt einfärben
Irgendwann lässt sich,
Wer unten ist, nicht länger unterwerfen
Und in fernen Straßen blüht der Jasmin
Ich mach das Fenster zu im kühlen Berlin
Denn der Frühling kommt hier immer erst spät an
Vielleicht, wenn sich im Süden mal
Die Winde gedreht haben

The people are crying out
It’s freedom time

Den Tod im Angesicht fliehen sie nach Italien
Unser Klima wandelt sich, wie Frühling in Arabien
Erdbeben, Taifune, nukleare Supergas
Anschläge, Börsencrashs, jeden Tag vor unseren Augen
Die Medien lenken, was wir Menschen denken
Was wir Beachtung schenken
Und auf was wir uns beschränken
Sie wollen nicht unterhalten, sie wollen uns unten halten
Divide et impera, Herrschen ist die Kunst zu spalten
Doch in fernen Straßen blüht der Jasmin
Ich mach die Fenster zu im kühlen Berlin
Denn der Frühling kommt hier immer erst später
Vielleicht, wenn sich im Süden mal
Die Winde gedreht haben

The people are crying out
It’s freedom time
The people are dying now
For freedom time

The people are crying out
It’s freedom time
The people are dying now
For freedom time

And I can feel the wind
As I’m looking out my window
Carrying melodies of spring
While a new sun is shining
Everyone’s in spin
Everybody mingle
Freedom starts within
It’s time my people sing

Und ich sitz' am Küchentisch im kalten Berlin
Mit 'nem Block und ‚'nem Stift
Und kann dem Alltag entfliehen
Und niemand klopft an die Tür,
Hier kommt noch niemand vollziehen
Bilder ziehen vorbei, wie Gil Scott Heron’s Melodien

And take the brightest stars up in the skies 
And place them in her eyes for me

Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you

Billy there ain't much wind tonight
Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand.
The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief,
Afraid to be caught stealin' the land!
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about.

And I always say two heads are better than one to
figure it out.

I don't need you, I don't need anybody helpin' me.
Well, I got it figured out for myself.
We're not important. What are we?
A couple o' specks with nothin'
Look up there

There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky,
And the sky's so big the sea looks small,
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all.

You're a funny kid, you know?
I don't remember meetin' a girl like you.
Hey, you're tryin' to get me to marry you?

No!

Then what's puttin' into my head, babe?
You're diff'rent, alright! I know what it is...
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me!
I wonder what it'd be like

What?

Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-

Kinda scrawny, and pale
Picking at my food,
And love-sick like any other guy.
I'd throw away my sweater, and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie.
If I loved you.

But you don't!

No, I don't!

But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know
How I loved you
If I loved you.

Aha I'm not the kinda fella to marry anybody!
No, even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to,
I wouldn't!

Julie
Don't worry about it, Billy!

Billy
Who's worried?

Julie
You were right about there bein' no wind.
The blossoms are comin' down by theirselves.
Just they're in time to, I reckon.",If I Loved You {*],1965

Patrice Rushen,"Whenever dark has fallen 
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive 
Until the day is dawning 
We can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights 

'Cause there's music in the air 
And lots of loving everywhere 
So give me the night 
Give me the night 
Give me the night 
Give me the night 

You need the evening action 
A place to dine, a glass of wine a little late romance 
It's a chain reaction 
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance. 

'Cause there's music in the air 
And lots of loving everywhere 
So give me the night 
Give me the night 
Give me the night 
Give me the night 

And if we stay together 
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high 
Never mind the weather 
We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light 

'Cause there's music in the air 
And lots of loving everywhere 
So give me the night 
Give me the night 
Give me the night 
Give me the night 
",Give Me the Night,2004
