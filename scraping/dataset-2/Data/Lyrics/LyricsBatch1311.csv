Billy Paul,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be
My hillbilly hula gal, my hillbilly hula gal

",Hillbilly Hula Gal,1997
Billy Paul,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's too late baby, it's too late now darling
It's too late.",Its Too Late,
Billy Paul,"And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
(Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey)

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
(Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey)

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids

Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
(Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey)

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Woo, woo, woo)
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
(Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey)",Mrs. Robinson,1970
Billy Paul,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1971

Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new

We got a thing, goin' on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We meet every day at the same cafe
Six-thirty and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the juke box plays our favorite songs

We got a thing, goin' on
We both know that it's wrong

Tomorrow we'll meet
The same place, the same time

We got a thing goin' on
We gotta be extra careful
We can't afford to build our hopes up too high
I wanna meet and talk with you
At the same place, the same cafe, the same time
And we gonna hold hands like we used to
We gonna talk it over, talk it over

That we gotta thing going on, a thing going on",Me and Mrs. Jones [Live][*],1972
Billy Paul,"Thanks for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again (Like I'm living again)

I'm so glad I ran into you
If I hadn't seen you I would have been through
Our love is lucky though
Could not stand anymore
Oh, I could never, never, never, never repay you

I'm so grateful for all of the things you've done for me
Especially listened to my problems, then savin' me from misery

I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again

I'm so glad you came along
You stopped me from singing that sad, sad song
You're the one who erased the pain
My life would never be the same
You're the very one, the only one that I've been waitin' for

I want to thank you for listenin' to all of my problems
And being my shelter in and out of the storm

I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Putting me all back together, together, together

I can live since I found you, baby
Now I can live since I got you back, baby

I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' this man
Don't you understand what you're doin' to me, baby
We both hooked up, we played together
I can't live, I can't live without you, babe, and didn't you, didn't you, didn't you save me babe

I want to thank for saving my life",Thanks for Saving My Life,1973

 Hey, got married
 But it don't really matter (Are you happy)
 No, it don't
 It don't really matter
 No
 Because I'm so glad to see you
 Been such a long, long time
 You know
 You look so fine, you're so good lookin'
 
 Just like the time when you just liked standing on the corner, you know
 Some people go back to the 50's, 60's, 70's
 ???You used to always???
 ???It was always ???
 But you link on the corner, talk about things before you go to school
 And all them years, all them years I thought about you
  


",So Glad to See You Again,1979
Billy Paul,"No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give

Billy Paul,"It's a little bit funny, Lord, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big mansion where we both could live

If, if I was a sculpture, Lord, honey, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
You gave a gift, Lord, and I'm gon' sing it for you

And you can tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite, quite simple but that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind what I wrote down in words, 
words
How wonderful life is when you're in the world, world, world

If, if, if I was on a rooftop I'd kick off my shoes
I'll write a few verses, and then I get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you and people like me
I want to, I want to keep turnin' on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do, Lord
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue
Anyway the things is, anyway the thing is, what I really mean
Your are the sweetest eyes, you've got the sweetest eyes
The clearest eyes I've ever seen, I hope you know that 

I hope you, I hope you wrote back and tell everybody that this is your 
song
It may be quite, quite simple but now that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind, but I wrote down in words,

Your are the sweetest eyes, the sweetest eyes
The sweetest eyes I've ever seen

I hoping you go back, go back and tell everybody that Billy Paul's got a 
song
I'm, I'm  gonna sit upon a, a rooftop and kick off my shoes
I'm gonna write it, write it, write it
I might come out with the Gospel, the Blues, the Jazz, the Rock and Roll

I'm gonna, got to, got to write me a simple song for everybody because 
this is my song
It may be quite, quite simple but that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind what I wrote down in words,

You come on back, you try to try again, try again

If you don't know me by now 
You'll never, never, never know me 
All the things that we've been through 
You should understand me 
Like I understand you 

Now baby I know the difference 
Between right and wrong 
I ain't gonna do nothin' 
To upset our happy home 

Oh, don't get so excited 
When I comee home a little late at night 
Cause we only act like children 
When we argue, fuss and fight

We all got our own funny moods 
I've got mine 
Woman, you got yours too 
Just trust in me 

Like I trust in you

That should be so easy to do 
Just get yourself together 

Or we might as well say good-bye 
What good is a love affair 
When we can't see eye-to-eye

Billy Paul,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be
My hillbilly hula gal, my hillbilly hula gal

Billy Paul Williams,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents

All I want for Christmas
Is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents

I don't need to hang my stocking

I won't even wish for snow

So brightly everywhere

Won't you please bring my baby to me

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Billy Pilgrim,"""On clear days it's fast black dead west
Sun on my cheek flat on my chest
I'm warm driving with all the citizens""
Halfway to work, halfway home
And the radio says there's been a terrible accident
Somewhere up by the waterways
I do more driving before 8 o'clock
Than most people do all day
""But the work is honest and the customers human""
Don't guess I could ask for more
The kids are in college and my wife is buying
Every single dress in the store
And Me, halfway to work halfway home
My doctor says my blood is pressuring me
My mama says this love is measuring me
Up each tick turned off
The road ices long before the bridge
Son just sit a while, and let the whiskey dull the edge
""But the work is honest and the customers human""
Don't guess I could ask for more
The kids are in college and my wife is buying
Every single dress in the store
And me, halfway to work halfway home
And me, halfway to work halfway home
And me, I just sit in this bar
And me, I just drive in my car
And me I just stay in my head
And me, I just sleep in this bed",Halfway Home,1994
Billy Pilgrim,"Just for the record there she lays
Shedding fur in patches and pulling at her face
I've been taking these things all night long
Hoping it will make me tired
Hoping it will keep me strong
Keep me strong
Bloodshot and blue
I can smell the guns
Through the bedroom walls
I can hear them run
Angels scurrying like rats
Until the daylight comes
And if it's me locked inside this box
Then I pray that my love can pick these locks
Oh no, here we go again
You try and you try
To untie the knots
With the grace of a sailor
And the will of a box
Both shaking like a leaf
Both staring at the lights
Both trying not to sleep
Both trying not to fight
And it's nights like this
When I'm scared to death
Will the morning come quickly
Will there be anything left?
Here we go again
The house finds the hush
And the battlefield is soft
And the footprints where a man and a woman have walked
Where a man and a woman have walked",Here We Go Again,1994
Billy Pilgrim,"Beauty's out walking
She's a step above the rest
I can't stop talking to myself
When I see her Sunday dress
The crowds bow and fall down at her feet
It's lucky street and I'm the one she'll meet
She never tires, when she takes me throught the fire
My mouth gets dry, she gives me wine and then builds on that desire
She always tells me exactly what she needs
I'm her favorite book and she loves to read
Hula hoop, I'm jumping through
She never lets me down
She keeps me spinning round and around and around
Where's she turning now what does she see
A dancing vision frenzied and free
Go, Hula hoop
Out of my head
And we'll spend our days in bed
I'll ask to see
The tricks that she only shows to me
She whirls she grinds she shimmies and she shakes
She'll always find commotions there to make

She never lets me down
She keeps me spinning round and around and around",Hula Hoop,1994
Billy Pilgrim,"The quarter moon like chalk on a slate
Board the windows up before it's too late
The weather man and my horoscope both agree
It's not in the stars tonight for folks like me
I chase the minute hand around my watch
And smell the rain blowing in
A flashlight for my soul and a blanket for the cold
I guess we'll sit this one through
Ah it's hurricane season
Batten down the hatches boys
It's hurricane season
Rain blurred on a night like this
You'd think there's nothing left on earth
The wind measures out the size of my bones
And tries to tell me what they're worth
Then it all starts up, gets out of control
And your life blows up like a great big balloon
It gets sucked up by the swirling wind
And you know another hurricane is coming through again
At the edge of the mariner's map it's written
""Beyond this place lie monsters""

Billy Pilgrim,"I can see you, don't even know you
Falling into the sheets at night
I place my hands flat on my chest
I feel the heart beat back the night
I try counting sheep, and I talk to the shepherd
And I play with my pillow for ever and ever
I sit alone and I watch the clock
I breathe in on the tick and out on the tock

[Refrain:]
I can hear your bare feet on the kitchen floor
I don't have to have these dreams no more
Cause I've found someone just to hold me tight
Hold the insomniac all night
Dig my head down deep so I can't hear the cars outside on the street
And the stars are laughing
They get a kick out of my misery
I tried everything short of Aristotle to Dramamine
And the whiskey bottle
Pray for the day when my ship comes in
I can sleep the sleep of the just again

They show me the door but they hold back the key
I ask myself what is wrong with me
Do they see something I don't see
I know you told me, not to take from strangers
But I am preoccupied with the dangers
And respect among thieves
There's a piracy on the high seas
And I am held for treason here
With no reasons clear, that I know
The old house by the late
A split was so apparent
An imminent break
How could I've known
I was just a kid
I was only doin'
Just what I was told
And I know you told me, not to take from strangers
But I am preoccupied with the dangers
And respect among thieves
There's a piracy on the high seas
And I am held for treason here
With no reasons clear, that I know
What do I know? The seeds don't grow
Through my broken home

I do my best drinking when I'm with someone else
I do my best singing when I'm all alone
And the blood comes down like sweat from my bones (yeah)
So my family tree may have a broken limb
I swore to the heavens never to go back again
Just give me some matches and a twist of fate
And I'll burn down this place, I'll burn down this place
'Cause there's too many people on my stage
I never did think it would work out this way
But there's too many people on my stage
You can break my heart
You can dry my soul
But the well runs deep and it's twice as old
I love my brother and I love my home
So just go ahead stranger, leave me alone

Billy Pilgrim,"Another sleepless night, turn off my light
Turn it off
Open my books, take in silence,
And wait for the dawn
Lock myself into place
Keep the sun off my face
When the morning comes
TRY to keep it all in sight
Form one thought, break it off, take a breath,
Carry on
You think you matter so much
That you're the only one
In your mind you're a star
That I can see from afar
Before you've even begun
To TRY to keep it all in sight
If you feel it then open your heart
No need to ask it what for
 tried to conquer all in sight
Walled their cities as high as they could
Kept them apart from themselves
Fought for ages and raged on the plains
With reasons misunderstood
But to the common good
Raised up their idols proteced their own walked on dinosaur bones
Spread a pestilent nature from mountain to sky
Until the rivers ran dry
And the rivers ran dry
That they owned
Watch the lights flash by my window
Throw ghosts on the wall
And every room in my house
Answers back when I call
Trace the outline within
Trust in dreams to begin
TRY to keep it all in sight
And TRY to work it all out
TRY if you will, TRY if they won't
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't

Get me out of here
From the subway's steamy kiss
Take me to the country and dip me in some bliss

Knowing you never will

So long after you've gone 
Oh precious memories that only make me cry 
But I keep holdin' on, oh why do I?  Oh, because...

Speak your name softly each night, or holding your picture tight

I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further

One mint julep was the cause of it all
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

'Cause I'd built a wall around my heart that no one could get through
For once I had it broke and I still feel the bruise

Another tear would never fall

She said that here is all you need to know for better love next time

Let her know all she meant to you
Show her she's that special one
Who shines in your eyes like the rising sun

I made mistakes, you made some too
I guess there's things we just can't undo

Back in my old home
Found my letterman's jacket, so I slipped it on
Deep in the pocket, still folded up tight
Was the letter you wrote to tell me goodbye

It smelled like old leather, as smooth as a child
I took a deep breath, then put it away
There was no need to read, I knew just what it would say

[Chorus]
I know the words by heart, I know every line
From ""this ain't easy"" to ""you'll get along just fine""
I know every comma, every question mark
No, I don't have to look, I know the words by heart

Scenes like home movies flash through my head
The homecoming game, that night on my bed
The words that you wrote still cut me in two
How you said you still cared but that we were through

[Chorus]

Ain't it funny how a memory 
Can play tricks on your mind
I don't remember a thing from my classes
But I can quote you every line

With your note in the pocket

Poured me a beer, then pictured your face
And drank a silent toast to things that time can't erase

She said, ""Listen to me, son, it's so
Let me tell ya, I've been down there
And I know.""

Down where lies'll cut you deep

These arms, they will never hold another 
These eyes, they are blind to any other 
These lips, no other girl will ever kiss 
This heart, it will always feel like this 

[Chorus]
Only God could stop me lovin' you 
Only God could tell me not to 
He sent you from Heaven 
Just to make my dreams come true 
When he opened the door 
That you came walkin' through 
Only God could stop me lovin' you 

Now we stuck oil in Oklahoma, yeah 
We won the Oscar in Hollywood 
We climbed the canyons of Arizona 
And, baby, makin' love never felt so good 

These arms, they will never hold another 
These lips, no other girl will ever kiss 
This heart, it will always feel like this 

[Chorus]

Well, there ain't no girl in the whole wide world 
Could take away my heart 
And there ain't no man who could steal 
Your hand and tear us apart 
But there is one God in Heaven above 
Who gave me love strong enough to call my own

Billy Ray Cyrus,"Back when I was young
When I was just a kid
The foolish things we done
The secrets that we hid

Out on our playground
Where I first touched your lips
Our first taste of love
Upon our fingertips

Now I go back in time
To a place they call the past
Where dreams are make-believe
And love can really last

Sometimes it's all so real
And it's always way too fast
This crazy world we live in
The past

Now I go back in time

I'd been drivin' without rest the whole night through
I saw this little cardboard sign about to fade away
Made a tear roll down my face with just one line,

Patsy, come home
It said, ""Patsy, come home""
I bet a mother's watchin' out a window
Or a lover's waitin' by the phone
No matter who's wrong
No matter what you're runnin' from
Somebody's tryin' to tell you they love you
Patsy, come home

By Little Rock the rain was turnin' into snow
By now, I'd prayed she'd gone back home again
I won't forget for some time the hopeful kind of love
Or the desperation of that cardboard sign

It said,
""Patsy, come home""
It said, ""Patsy, come home""
I know a mother's watchin' out a window

Take me to Redneck Heaven
When I'm dead and gone
Where my southern roots are buried
Bandstand still lives on
With some smoky pool room standing
With Jesus on the wall
Take me to Redneck Heaven 
When the good Lord comes to call (comes to call, comes to call)

Mother Mary riding proud on the dashboard of my truck
To remind me to count my blessings and to pray for just a little luck
Brother Levi waits for me at the local Seven-Eleven
But just in case I don't make it there
Send me to Redneck Heaven

[Chorus]

There I was on those sawdust streets of gold
And I saw Conway Twitty, and there was Keith Willy
Before I could Hank Williams I turned around and I was face to face
With the king of Rock and roll

You can have your streets of gold
Sawdust will do just fine
And about those singing angels
Just give me Patsy Cline
If I could only meet the king
I'll feel I've rolled a seven
Give me swingin' doors instead of pearly gates

He had racin' in his blood
Hope and Will and Mighty Fine was the only stock he'd run

""Son there goes the fastest horse in a one horse town""

Looks like they've turned a pack mule loose among these thoroughbreds
Colt said, ""This old mule's been places most blue bloods fear to tread.""

Foot still on the gas
The leader watched a car slip by
And beat him to the flag
And painted on the trunk

""Boy you just been passed
By the fastest horse in a one horse town.""

Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
She said Mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.

The note said Misses Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking and a runnin' round with men and going wild
And we don't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way
It was signed by the secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A. 

Well, it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Misses Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room 
And as she walked up to the blackboard I still recall the words she had to say
She said, I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A. 

Well there's Bobby Taylor, sitting there and seven times he's asked me for a date
Misses Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mister Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't Widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well Mister Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed to long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Tompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did , it happened just this way

You got to go, got to run
Hit it hard and get it done
Everyone can see you're going far
You got responsibilities
A crazy schedule that you keep
And when you say that time's a-wasting
You don't know how right you are
Busy man

There's a woman in the bedroom crying
Saying I thought we had plans
You say honey I'm sorry I'll make it up
When the job slows down and I'm not such
A busy man

[Chorus]

Have you ever seen a headstone with these words
""If only I had spent more time at work""

There's a call one day from the office
They need you down in Birmingham
You say no way, the weekend's mine
I got plans with the kids and a date with my wife
I'm a busy man

[Chorus]",Busy Man,1998
Billy Ray Cyrus,"I gave two teeth in a teenage brawl
For a girl whose name I can't recall
Then we broke up
I gave a knee to the football team
Chasing that high school state champ dream
We almost won

I gave junior college almost a year
Then I gave a Greyhound twenty bucks
And that's how I got here

I give all my money for a slice of daily bread
I give forty honest hours to a boss I never met
And I gave my soul to Jesus at the age of twenty-two
So there ain't much left to offer
But I give my heart to you

I gave a beard and a head of hair
To a boot camp corporal with a barber's chair
At Camp LeJeune
I gave Uncle Sam what he bargained for
Twenty-four months, not a minute more
I just didn't fit in

Before you were mine
And I was dying to be in his shoes
Now he's gone away
And I'm in his place

The shadow he cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife

I can't walk away
But how can I stay
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall
I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life in his shoes

He wasn't a saint
So what are these chains
He holds on both of us
You give it your best
But you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit

That was all I really had to say
But since we're talkin', hey by the way

How's my world treatin' you
Are you happy there in my shoes
While I've got you on my phone
Tell me does she make you feel at home
You've got everything I had to lose
Is she makin' all your dreams come true
Oh tell me how's my world treatin' you

She used to treat me like a king
Oh she was my everything

They only tighten the knot deep inside
And the aching won't end
'Til I hold you again

Why did you have to go
Why am I missing you so
One heartbeat at a time
I'm going out of my mind
Missing you, missing you

I started a letter, I stared at your name
There wasn't a line that didn't echo my pain
There was no sound at all
But the slow lonely fall
Of an unspoken tear

Why did you have to go
Why am I missing you so
One heartbeat at a time
I'm going out of my mind
Missing you, missing you

Life may take us in different directions

And see what's under the hood

Sporty little model standing by the door
So I took her for a spin on the old dance floor
Headlights shining bright but nobody home
Now I need something that's more my speed
Got a whole lotta time to find what I need

She couldn't buy the lies I told
All she wanted was to be needed
Someone that she could call her own

The love I know I took for granted
Until she walked out of my door
Too little too late to say I'm sorry
She's not cryin' anymore

[Chorus]
She's not crying anymore
She ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face a new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore

I hear she's really doing well now
She's picked herself up off the ground
I wasn't there when I was needed 
But I was there to let her down

Sometimes you know I feel so foolish
If I knew then what I know now
Another tear would never fall
Cause I'd give our love my all
If we could work things out somehow

There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place

Billy Ray Cyrus,"Old Mr. Johnson and his wife attend my church.
Fifty-two years and they still love like it's the first.
He holds the door, she holds his hand, they kiss a little.
He helps her in the truck, she slides right to the middle.
And so one day I ask him how they keep the fire alive.
He said ""You see two old people, but somethin' down deep inside.

""Love is always sixteen.
""It's always the same, though people might change
""Its forever young
""Love don't have to turn cold, though lovers grow old.
""Love don't have to grow weak,
""Cause love is always sixteen.""

Baby, don't you find it just a little bit peculiar,
However close we get, we're never too familiar.
Everyday I wake up lovin' you so much it hurts,
And, baby, every kiss we kiss still feels like it's the first.
And it turns me on to know this feeling's never gonna fade.
I'm still gonna want you even when we're old and grey.

Love is always sixteen.
It's always the same, though people might change
Its forever young
Love don't have to turn cold, though lovers grow old.
Love don't have to grow weak,
Cause love is always sixteen.

Through all of its phases, it's timeless and ageless.
You're like the sun in a clear morning sky.

Love is always sixteen.
It's always the same, though people might change
Its forever young
Love don't have to turn cold, though lovers grow old.
Love don't have to grow weak,
Cause love
Cause love is always sixteen.

And she settles in with her head on my chest
Why do I feel like my hearts gonna burst
That I'm willing to die for this angel at rest

And why am I filled with unshakable faith
When I look at that child so fragile and sweet
There's something eternal I see in her face
Something much more than her mother and me

Maybe I'm looking at the face of God
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God
And He's smiling back at me

Why do I feel like the smallest of things
When I try to count all the stars in the sky
And when I see the world that were in at it's worst
Why do I feel like it'll all be alright

I can't see the wind as it moves through the trees
So how do I know that I know that I know
That somebody out there is speaking to me
Saying I love you and you're not alone

Maybe I'm looking at the face of God
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God
And He's smiling back at me

Oh, I know that I know that I know
That He's out there
Somebody's out there
When I look at the beauty around me
And the love that surrounds me

Maybe I'm looking at the face of God
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God
Maybe I'm looking at the face of God
And He smiles back at me",Face of God,2003
Billy Ray Cyrus,"We were born with wings to fly
But sometimes we can't reach that high
Ã¢??Cause it feels like the sky is falling down

Against the odds, against the rain
You dig your heels in to slow that train
So many wishes in the lost and found
One little thing can turn it all around

[Chorus]
Holding on to a dream
Trying to keep hope alive
You can reach out to me
You can reach down deep inside
When the whole world's gone insane
A ray of light remains
The days you know it seems
Sometimes the hardest thing is
Holding on to a dream

At times you win, at times you lose
Sometimes life puts a rock in your shoe
But something in you keeps you walking on

Leave the fear and doubt in the past
Just believe, don't look back

All up hill, but that's all right

Billy Ray Cyrus,"He didn't have the answers
To half the questions his son ask him
A child's mind is a curious thing
But when his son hugged him and said Dad
You know I love you
How much do you love me
Daddy didn't have to think

[Chorus]
With his arms open wide
Just as far as they could go
He said as far as I can reach
Is not enough to show
I would give my life for you
You are my flesh and blood
I love you this much

She stood there crying
Broken-hearted
Looking up at Him
And said why are You doing this
He looks down at her wanting to hold her
And wipe her tears away
He has to leave and that's the way it is

Billy Ray Cyrus,"I've never seen that little town where You were born
It was long before my time and far away
But as time goes on I think about You more and more
And wonder what it was like in those day's
I wish I could have walked with You 
You might have called me friend
But there's no way I could've known You then

But I know You now
I know Your name
A lot of awesome things You did and why You came
I didn't know You when
You helped that lame man rise up from his bed
I didn't know You when 
You stood there and called Lazarus from the dead
But I know You now

I didn't see You feed that tired hungry crowd
With five loaves and two fish one afternoon
And I didn't see You catch Peter's hand
So he wouldn't drown
When he tried the walk on water like You
I couldn't see Your face 
When You taught those little kids
There's just no way I could've seen You then

But I see You now
I see Your love
I see a tiny glimpse of You in every one of us
I didn't see You on the mount of olives
Crying as You prayed
I couldn't see You when You were kissed by Judus and betrayed
But I see You now

Oh, I didn't need You when that bitter angry mob
Shouted out crucify him
And I couldn't have needed You 
When they laughed and mocked You
But it could be I'm a little bit like them

‘Cause I need You now
I need Your grace
And how I needed Your forgiveness to be saved
I didn't need You when Pilates soldiers beat You to the ground
I didn't need You when You hung there 
Bleeding from Your thorny crown
But I need You now
Oh, I need You now

There's a church on the
Corner in a harbor town

Then you could hear the Preacher say

Love has no walls
Love needs no space or time

Worst storm you ever did see

But I fall apart and then I walk away
There's an angry world pressed against my back
And down every turn I keep looking back

And I know You promise me
Love through eternity
So why can't I just hold on

I want to live, I want to love
But I'm afraid my simple faith will never be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
But I don't know where to start
It's on the tip of my heart

So want You take my hand
Because I'm sinking in
To this life I've made, but don't understand
The clock moves so slowly
Time goes so fast
But in this world wind world that will never last

This love You're giving me
It's not just make believe
Help me to just hold on

I want to live, I want to love
But I'm afraid my simple faith will never be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
But I don't know where to start
It's on the tip of my heart

Open the sky's
Open my eyes
And all my fears scatter away
So I walk in grace, 'cause I've seen Your face
And You are all that matters to me

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
I'm not afraid because Your grace will always be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
I want to live, I want to love
I'm not afraid because Your grace will always be enough

Billy Ray Cyrus,"He's halfin' his sandwich, his chips and Baby Ruth
Puttin' them back in a sack his mama packed
With a sticker that say's 'Jesus Loves You'
He's jumpin off the bus, runnin' in the house
Talkin' to mom about his day
Hidin' that paper sack in a baseball glove
Ridin' his bike straight to the freeway
Where there's an old man with a shoppin' cart
With a dirty face and a purple heart
Who's sayin' son you'll never know how much this means

Boy say's
Wouldn't you do this for me
If I were reachin' out to you
Wouldn't you give me food to eat if I were hungry to
Wouldn't you do this for me

Tonight, that little boy's dad is flyin' down the freeway
It's pourin' rain as he leaves the road
He's rolling down that concrete bank
Through the flames and the broken glass
An old man takes his hand
Finds a cell phone on the backseat
He's sayin' get here fast as you can
Now the bum that lives beneath the bridge
Pulls him safely from that flooding ditch
Man asked why'd you risk your life to save mine

He said
Wouldn't you do this for me
If I were reachin' out to you
Wouldn't you try to save my life, if I needed you to
Wouldn't you do this for me

Now he's layin' in that hospital bed prayin' a silent prayer
And he can't help but ask him,
Lord, did you put that beggar there
As a nurse pulls back the curtains
All he can see is a billboard sign
A sixty foot Jesus hangin' on the cross
At the bottom, just one line

Wouldn't you do this for me
Wouldn't you do this for me
Wouldn't you

To be surrounded by all this sand
To fear the echoes of live rounds
And to never sleep when the sun goes down
So I'm writing you this letter
To say I miss you more than ever and to promise you this

When I make it back to Memphis
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And never let you go
And girl I promise you a kiss
For every day we've missed

I'll have to say I think we've done some good
If I had to do it all again I know I would
There's still a few shots every now and then
But they say this thing is finally coming to an end
So this might be my final letter
I say the sooner the better cause I'm ready to come home

Next to his medal and a flag, that she would gladly give back

Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't wodow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down

Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And when you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No I wouldn't put you on because it really did it happened just this way

Cruisin' downtown in your Camaro,

REO Speedwagon on the stereo.

It's kind of catchy,

Kind of a virus,

Cutting your hair like Billy Ray Cyrus.

You're probably bummed,

You probably cried,

You're probably sad that the guy from Lynrd Skynrd died,

You're probably singing ""oh, oh, oh"",

All night long.

Chorus""

Feel the power of the PHANTOM MULLET,

Tremble and cower from the PHANTOM MULLET,

White metal burn of the PHANTOM MULLET,

Combed straight or permed it's THE PHANTOM MULLET,

And you, cutting it short on top,

I want that for me.

Growing it long in the back,

So savage and so free.

Drop into first you're taking it slow,

You're such a rock-star,

You could never know.

I wish I was singing, ""oh, oh, oh"",

All night long.

Its Friday afternoon about five
We had to make some cuts around here
Sorry, Mac, you won't survive""

The hard word's ringing in his ears
Couldn't believe all the years he'd given
Suddenly had disappeared

His first thought was, ""How do I tell her
That I lost my job today?""
As he left he felt so wounded
And his boss just slipped away

When I gave it everything I got?
And driving home the fire kicked in
And the feeling sorry for himself just stopped

You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips

And if you tell my heart

You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip

Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not OK.
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind

God I miss that hometown girl
Want to hold her

But you made it hotter
Found that shade tree there by the riverbank
Sitting there, our toes all muddy
That first kiss
Was sweeter than honey

I say, man that was a good day

The ones we keep
The one we know we'll always hold on to

But the best ones that I've had
Always seem to start and end with you

Yeah, those are the times
I know that I won't forget
Like that July 4th hugged up by the levy
You squeezed me hard
And told me you loved me
Fireworks flying
Talking our breath away

Felt like we were melting together
Thinking I could do this forever
And every time that I look back
I say, man that was a good day

When we're finished with this ride

Billy Ray Cyrus,"I have seen the morning
Burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling
Of the freedom of an eagle when she flies

Turning on the world
The way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine
And the shadows of her eyes

Waking in the morning
To the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people
And the places that I've been

Teaching me that yesterday
Was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money
Love and time we have to spend

Loving her was easier
Than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together with a feeling
That I've never known before in my time

She ain't ashamed to be a woman
Or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answers to the easy way
She's opened every door to my mind

But dreaming was as easy
As believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier
Than anything I'll ever do again",Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again),2016
Billy Ray Cyrus,"I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
And lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days
I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightman
Knowin' well that your best days are gone
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, and 'old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay

And they still are, it seems

Billy Ray Cyrus,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound

But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison

To the sunny side of the street

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Billy Sprague,"I was down in the valley
Of the shadow of death
Where the passion for life
Drained like blood from my chest
And it took more than my will just to
Take a step
When the compass of hope
Was gone

In a silence so black
That I wished for the blues
Every desperate prayer
Seemed like Heaven refused
And some days I found faith meant just
Tyin' my shoes
And it was
All I could do
To press on

Press on me amigo
Press on mon ami
Walk on in the face
Of the mystery
Though the night hides the light
Through the darkness still dawn
Tie your shoes, my dear friend
And press on

(Walk on)

On the ocean so lonesome I was not left on
Had some heavenly friends
When my heart was a stone
And they carried my heartache and
Made it their own
When the current of sorrow
Was strong
(And one said)
""I pray your memories will not drag you down
Not be anchors but treasures
Of the love that you've found""
And His kind words turned hurt into comfort somehow
And the wind in my sails
To press on

So press on me amigo
Press on mon ami
Walk on in the face
Of the mystery
Though the night hides the light
And the journey is long
Lean on me, my dear friend
And press on

Though the days seem like years
There may be giants in our fears
Ah, but they who are sowin' tears
They shall reap in joy
They shall run and leap for joy!

So press on me amigo
Press on mon ami
Walk on in the face
Of the mystery

Though the night hides the light
And the journey is long
Lean on me, my dear friend

Wrong or right, don't let it shake you
Fight the fight, whatever it makes you
That's all right, I know you can break through

In the right crowd you act so loud, got your head in the clouds

Find something to keep me satisfied

Runnin' for the money, layin' out the green
It's a tax accountant's nightmare, it's a rock n' roll dream
The income may be different but the outcome's still the same
You'll never be a winner boy until you play the game

Hounded to distraction, racin' to and fro
Losin' my direction keepin' up my status quo
Now I tried, tried, tried, tried
It just don't seem to keep me satisfied

A hundred thousand miles in a 747
Take it all in style if you wanna get to heaven
Chasin' all the action every single night
Never understand it but you try to do it right
Ragged 'round the edges, none the worse for wear
Cuttin' all the corners but they never get me there

Now I try, try, try, try
It just don't seem to keep me satisfied
",Keep Me Satisfied,1982
Billy Squier,"Sometimes I wonder...think I just can't stand no more
Can't seem to find myself, or what it is I'm lookin' for
People call out my name
Lately things they don't seem the same
That's when I know...i gotta make the rounds again
Find yourself in the danger-zone
Reachin' out through the under-tones
Chase the spirit you can't control
The inner notions 're takin' hold


Listen to the heartbeat

I remember those cold cold nights...we'd stay up all night long
I can remember you holdin' out...and I'd be holdin' on
You can put out my fire
You can stir up my one desire
You can make me wonder how we could ever shy away
You bet your life on that rendezvous
Close your eyes and it all comes true
Cast your fortune into the wind
Those inner notions'll pull you in


Listen to the heartbeat
",Listen to the Heartbeat,1982
Billy Squier,"I been a traveler for more than too few years
I learned my lessons, I stilled my fears
My sole possessions, they steer me through it all
Sweet dreams and innocence, they cushion my falls

Feel the passion run you blind
See the vision dancin' in my mind

One good woman, who's all of what she seems
One good woman to share my dreams
One good woman put all the games aside
One good woman make the most of our lives

We live a life of fact and fantasy
We alter circumstance to fit our needs
We gain in fortune, but we lose in time
One door will open and one will close behind

Find the loner from the pack
Storm the mansions, I ain't never turnin' back

One good woman, she's all I hope to find
One good woman, think of me in kind
One good woman, she won't get me down
One good woman, turn my head around

Keepin' her distance, but oh she don't let go
One good woman, she makes it so
Over the air-waves or across the sea
One good woman, she's more than enough for me
",One Good Woman,1982
Billy Squier,"Take my soul to the lost-and-found

I could never ever lie to you
I could never even try

You may love on someone just to talk to

Billy Squier,"In every heart there comes a time
You find yourself, you speak your mind
On your own

No man can lead two separate lives
One castle keep, one will decide
It's not right

For every heart there burns a flame
To light the soul and make you one again
In every heart there looms a voice
We'll have our day, oh yeah

I lived a lie bound from my birth
I need to find what life is worth
It's not mine

Oh secret soul that burns inside
No forced control can make you hide
Open wide

A restless heart who needs a friend
To free my soul and make me one again
Within my heart I found a voice
I'll have my say

To light the soul and make you one again
In every heary there looms a voice
We'll have our day
In every heart there booms a voice",On Your Own,1984
Billy Squier,"From over the air comes a voice without care
Says we're doin' all right
But day out and day in from what he's been sayin'
We're in for a fight
I glance at myself and the world rushin' by
I can see for myself and the fear comes alive
Shades of termination--we're dyin' to survive


1984

Machine is the mind--it will rule by design
So you're never alone
We store information without confirmation
Accept the unknown
I think to myself of the times we have tried
To be true to ourselves and to live with the lie
Avoid the contradictions--just keep yourself alive


1984

I can't help it...I can't help it...I can't help it...
Life is your decision--we choose to do or die
Can you live with the reality of 1985


Polite conversation ain't no consolation
For blanks in your eyes
Amidst the confusion there lives the illusion
That love will survive
But I got a chance with myself if I try
To be sure of myself and myself choose to try
Fight for stimulation and love to stay alive

Some find answers--and some will reach for the sky

And see the truth it must reveal
And in your heart that truth will shine

Say you walk right - you talk right - and your hair's so wild
Snow-white - hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between

Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment - leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion - set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near

Take me in your arms - roll me through the night
Take me to your heart - rock me tonite

You do it all right - you're passion to see
You been schooled in the art of romancin' me
Hold tight - you're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside

No one's stoppin' us now -
We go down, down where the music's loud
If it's all night - hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love - play it all for me

Takin' our chances - face 'em side by side
Live for the moment - on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be

Through the years--a million miles
A trial of errors--a life of trials

There's a candle by my bed
There's a face in the doorway
There's a price on my head


Sweet release...come in peace
Sweet release...won't you carry me on
Sweet release...my falls increase
Sweet release...i'm not that strong


Sex machine will break you down
Strip you clean and take your crown
Wasted nights--rise and fall
One-way lights--they hide it all
Now I stand before the mirror
Hold the candle to my face
I can feel the scars burnin'
But they don't leave a trace


Sweet release...rest in peace
Sweet release...i toss and turn
Sweet release...come and teach me
Sweet release...we never learn


Black and white is black and red
None are right--but some are dead
Through every life the war drags on
Our hopes and dreams lie ripped and torn

Don't hang out in the shadow of a doubt
It's time you split before they sign you out
They'll have you sing the blues...


Take a look behind ya
Take it on the run
Take a look behind ya
Look into the risin' sun


You can dance, you can sing, but it doesn't mean a thing without rhythm
You can slip--slide--stumble through the rest of your life
Time won't stop--never gonna stop ya
You push the limit 'til the day you drop
Time don't stop--race against the clock
You shun the risk--can you stand the shock
You got a lot to lose...


Take a look behind ya
Take it on the run
Take a look behind ya
Look into the risin' sun


Take a look behind ya
Take it as it comes
Take a look behind ya
Don't forget the things you done


You can run--you can hide but you never put aside what you're feelin'
Keep your balance--keep your stride--let it run through the heart of your life

When we give a little...we give all we have to give...give a little

Now we all got our problems...and some you can't ignore
But if we stand together we stand for somethin' more

When we give a little...we give all we have to give...give a little

They say the days are gettin' short...and the nights are gettin' longer
The weak are gettin' weaker...and the strong keep gettin' stronger
On a street with no connections...everyone can use protection
They're stirrin' up the lies, they spin 'em round between me and you
They say there's nothin' you or I can ever really hope to do
But every man in every nation can hear the call of soul salvation

A hundred million faces...a hundred billion tears
No one can come between us to isolate our fears
With all we have to hope for...and all we have to give
Whenever it's your heart that's beatin'...there's a chance for us to live

Locked on collision--wrong over right between boy and girl
Call it the fashion--but can you deny your vices are one up on you
Caught in the patterns--longin' to fly...sayin' it's all you can do

When you're the only one...you see the lonely one

Ashes to ashes, dust into night and a trail of blue
Split screens and sidewalks...six strings and nighthawks and someone new
You got your answers and you got some time...but sometimes they run out on you
You got your reasons and you got your lies...but sometimes they leave you
Lonely, so lonely...lonely so lie

When you're the only one...you feel the lonely one
Now you're the only one...you see the lonely one

You try to be certain...you're certain to try
Chasin' your shadows...changin' your mind
Facin' those faces again and again and again...

Turn from the window and walk through the shadows of love gone by
Searchin' your manner way down inside, still you don't know why
Lost in the mirror you're hopin' to find the fountain that's run out on you
You got your rhythm and you got your lines, but sometimes they leave you
Lonely so lonely...lonely so lie

When you're the only one...you feel the lonely one
Now you're the only one...you see the lonely one

Where there's a cause you fight, where there's a cost you pay

Find an empty heart, you feel the passion play
It's when reactions start that you can't look away

Life below zero, never say never

Love is the hero

There is no sacrifice, there is no dead-end street
There is no sound advice, only the watch you keep

With every move you make the song will pull you near

Turn you world around and it will come your way
Through your cold-chill nights and in your hard-earned days
When you face the light it may be hard to do
But when it's all too right then it will come to you

Love is the hero, soldier forever
Love is the hero, you live to remember

No path is too steep, no distance too wide
No question too deep, no force can divide
You fortune you seek, the road will unwind
You're comin' to me, to search is to find

And when you start to fall into that frozen space
And when you reach the wall and there's no sunny place
And when it all comes down you make it anyhow, anyway

It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye
It's your life...there you sit as the moments flash by
Chargin' day for night...chargin' grey for white
Chase the firelight...circular reason will leave you behind

Now you go walkin' down the street...you hear that someone call your name
Say you know, you gotta learn to live and learn to love and learn to lose and learn to live again
Run from the angel of night...now she's waitin' for you

It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye
It's your life...still you sit as it's passin' you by
Chargin' day for night...chargin' grey for white
Chase the firelight...wait for tomorrow we'll leave you behind

Run to your angel tonight...now she's waitin' for you
All you want...all you want

It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye
It's your life...don't you wait for the ashes to fly
Change your life...now don't sit as the moments flash by
Save your life...she'll be yours for the wink of an eye
Trade your day for night...turn your grey to white
Fight with fire, fight...wait for tomorrow and kiss me goodbye

I only know you are mine tonite
And for a while we can hold on tight
That's all I know, you are mine tonite

For once in my life my dream is alive
Never forgotten when I call out to you

Your love is my life--I live my life through your love
Always knew it could feel so right--yours are the arms that I'm dreamin' of
Though the powers that be may deceive me
I know in my heart you won't leave me
Our promise is made--our dream can come true
Crimes are forgotten when I call out to you

Though we're worlds apart, you're right by my side

And no one comes to break us down
And the walls that stood between us
Tumble to the ground
It's time to find someone to run to

I've got a place in mind
It's known as conscience point
It's where the clouds roll by
They say that nothin' really matters
I'm goin' out to find
Why people come this way
And put the past behind
You know there really is a reason

Changing faces...trading places
Nothing lasts anymore...it's hard when you try
Star-crossed lovers run for cover
I don't know if it's right...but I know how I feel

When you're tired of all those things
You never said before
And although you've tried you never opened that door
It's time to find someone to run to

We'll run the roads tonite
We'll meet at conscience point
I look into your eyes
You say that nothin' really matters
If I could change your mind
If you would look my way
And leave it all behind
You'd know you really mean so much to me

You've never done before
And you never took the time
To fall in love before

Come to the party--and bring your friends along, listen

Roll over...get down
Gonna make you...right now
So heavy...so nice
We'll put your...nerves on ice

I been to the banker and I been to see the queen
Six of seven wonders have I made out of my dreams
I could be a junkie--I could be like you
We could be together...then what would we do
Life for the takin' is just outside your door
Time is the one thing that no one can afford
Listen...
Roll over...right now
Gonna make you...get down
So heavy...s'all right
We'll put your nerves on ice

Don't let them bring you down
Don't let them turn you upside down
Only the strong survive...
And no one here gets out alive

Call for the doctor--you can call out for a priest
But you can't take it with you when they're taggin' your disease
There're no easy lessons--and there're no guarantees
But you can go the distance be what you want to be
Stand where you're able...leave with your pride
Come to the table and throw down for your side, listen

Roll over...get down

Billy Squier,"Christmas is the time to say ""I love you""
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer
Christmas is the time to say ""I love you""
And a feeling that will last all through the year

On the corner carolers are singing
There's a touch of magic in the air
From grownup to minor no one could be finer
Times are hard but no one seems to care
Christmas Eve and all the world is watching
Santa guides his reindeer through the dark
From rooftop to chimney, from Harlem to Bimini
They will find a way into your heart

Christmas is the time to say ""I love you""
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer
Christmas is the time to say ""I love you""
And a feeling that will last all through the year

Just outside the window snow is falling
But here beside the fire we share the glow
Of moonlight and brandy, sweet talk and candy
Sentiments that everyone should know
Memories of the year that lays behind us
Wishes for the year that's yet to come
And it stands to reason that good friends in season
Make you feel that life has just begun

Christmas is the time to say ""I love you""
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer
Christmas is the time to say ""I love you""
And a feeling that will last all through the year

So when spirits grow lighter
And hopes are shinin' brighter
Then you know that Christmas time is here

To keep the faith 'fore it gets too late
Hold her down when she wants to fly
Always tryin' to tell me...how it ought to be
And if I treat her right then she won't be the end of me
I don't know why...
She cast my life in shame
But everytime she walk I seem to fall down on my honor

She's got rhythm...rocks me to my soul
Hey!...the girl's all right
She's got rhythm...steers me when I roll
Hey!...the girl's all right

What's she tryin' to say
Does she ever hear me at all
Everyday there's somethin' that she wants
Tells me things that I can't recall
Nails me down--she's a hammer
Can't see no way out
Of all the ways you can run these days--you can't out-run the mouth
I don't know why
At times she can go on
But if by chance we meet I know
With her it won't be wrong

She's got rhythm...rocks me to my soul
Hey!...the girl's all right
She's got rhythm...scares me, then I know
Hey!...the girl's all right

Sometimes I fail to notice...sometimes I play too rough
But when I feel I'm losin' her
Well then I've had enough
Knows my limitations...and she always calls my bluff
I take back what I said tonight

She's got rhythm...scares me, then I know
Hey!...the girl's all right

Billy Squier,"Love...it's that one big step you take
Eyes...watchin' every move you make
When the fear lifts you up...you won't back down
...be careful what you say
Beware of the dark...they'll steal your heart away

It's illogical...psychological...
It can change your world--make it all work out
...so illogical...

Hands of seduction...hands of seduction
Hands of seduction...workin' workin' overtime

Crimes of the heart are hard to take
Lies can't defend your first mistake

When you're vulnerable...it's improbable
You can face your world--make it all work out

So you say you owe the sands of time
If you don't look now your life won't lie
Jack and jill conquered the hill...
But even still they had to pay the bill
For their father's sins
Like a poor boy...(say) you just can't win
In the hands of the devil there's double trouble
You got it comin'...no use in runnin'
Said I've always known there's a price you pay...
Like when I see you babe

Beyond your heart...beyond a home...
Way beyond your shame..

I don't wanna drift away

We can surely find a way

Now I don't mind...lookin' at the photographs
I find myself...holdin' back the tears
And I don't mind...when I read the words you wrote to me
'cause I got time...to silence all my fears

I don't want us torn apart
I don't wanna slip away
I don't want us torn apart

I don't wanna throw it all away
I don't wanna lose my hold

But hercules...is not my middle name
Walls will fall...and you'll be standin' next to me
And hercules...will never be the same

Learned to fly but I was broken

When I was just 19

Didn't know where to find myself
The rules they were not so simple
Makes no sense tryin' to face this world
'til you're old enough to fight

I was hungry in '81
For a time I thought I'd found her
Found myself on the road again
Freezin' from the cold
Fortune found me in '82
With a girl from way down under
She seemed like the natural thing
I thought I knew for sure

Tried to hold her--I could not see
Past her eyes was a spell unbroken
Battered visions and frozen dreams
That would never see the light...now you're my

Have you ever been mistreated?  You know just what I'm talking about. 
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve,

Billy Stewart,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,1966
Billy Stewart,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Billy Stewart,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Billy Stewart,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for

Billy Stewart,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Billy Strange,"Frankie Laine Sixteen Tons Lyrics:
Some people say a man is made outta mud.
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood.
Muscle and blood, skin and bones; 
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong.

You load sixteen tons an' what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt.
St Peter don't you call me cause I can't go:
I owe my soul to the company store.

Well, I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine.
I picked up a shovel, Iwalked out to the mine.
I loaded sixteen tons of Number 9 coal, 
An' the straw boss said: ""Well, bless my soul.""

You load sixteen tons an' what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt.
St Peter don't you call me cause I can't go:
I owe my soul to the company store.
 
Well, I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain.
Fightin' an' trouble are my middle name.
I was raised in the canebreak by an old mama lion, 
Can't no high-toned woman makes me walk the line.

You load sixteen tons an' what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt.
St Peter don't you call me cause I can't go:
I owe my soul to the company store.

They have an orchestra up in the trees

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

So I sat in my room for twenty seven days,
No she never called, I had something to say!
No she never called, I had something to say!

Why would she put me through such torture,
I would have given my life for her,
She was the one that knocked me over,
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner

Well, I heard she's great and her new boyfriend's lame,
She can go to hell I'll never be the same!
She can go to hell I'll never be the same!

Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride, until the coast
To leave behind, all of my ghosts
Searching for something, I couldn't find at home

Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit, and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time!

In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

When it gets dark, in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head, will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead!

In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves... on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

I never once thought, I'd ever be caught!
Staring at sidewalks, hiding my track marks!
I left my best friends, or did they just leave me?

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Cut down like lambs at slaughter,
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Mean so little to so many
Why does she mean everything to me?

Is it worth the pain, with no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Questioning her good intention
Jealousy's a bad invention
When you push on glass, it's bound to break

Even when she was defensive,
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

I never walked so far on a lonely street
With no-one there for me
Is it worth the pain, with no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Accept this confession! I'm walking on pins and needles
You're not my possession! I'm walking on pins and needles
My conscience is vicious! I'm walking on pins and needles
And I'm begging forgiveness! I'm walking on pins and needles

I never walked so far on a lonely street,
With no one there for me

And now it's clear to me

With their pitchforks high in the air.

Cleaning up the mess we've made or watching your TV?
And if you have to ask, then you don't have a clue,
There's snow in Arizona while they're bombing in Beirut!

I hope some day, when I'm dead and gone,
We learn to right, everything that's wrong,
With loving hands, turn sick to strong,
Our time will tell, if life goes on, on, on, on, on

When the storm hits your front door, with a roar you can't ignore,
You run, run, away, but there's no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night, you don't got no chance to fight,
'Cause you're too late, so kiss your ass goodbye, mate!

It just don't make no sense, there's a million mouthes to feed,
We got military action over monetary need
And you can turn your back, or you can plant the seed
You can choose compassion over universal greed

I hope some day, when I'm dead and gone,
We learn to right, everything that's wrong,
With loving hands, turn sick to strong,

You run, run, away  but there's no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night, you don't got no chance to fight,
Cause you're too late, so kiss your ass goodbye, mate!

And you can turn your back, but it won't go away
And you don't look scared, but you should be afraid
You can shut your mouth, but you still have a say
And you just don't care, for tomorrow, today

And you can turn your back, but it won't go away
And you don't look scared, but you should be afraid
You can shut your mouth, but you still have a say

No way, no way, no way, no way!

Billy Talent,"Today I walked down our old street
Past the diner where we'd meet
Now I dine alone in our old seats
The cold wind blows right through my bones
And I feel like I'm getting old
But I wish I was getting old with you
I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
She laughed as we picked out our children's names

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

Her clothes hang in the closet still
The phone sits on the windowsill
And every time it rings it gives me chills
My heart just stopped when I was told
Doctor, doctor, on the phone
Said my love was never coming home
I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Dark clouds eclipse the sun won't shine again

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain, crying in pain

And I'm not looking for answers
No, I'm not looking for answers
But dear God, why did you choose her?

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

Got so quiet, that you'd hear a pen drop

Another rocket launcher going off inside my mind
Tight cuffs only hold me tight
Every thought about the future leaves me terrified
I'm sick of the same old lies
Why don't you talk about your feelings? Who gives a shit about mine?
Death grips got a hold of my side
Because the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry

Just when you thought you've seen it all
A storm awaits behind the door
Disgruntled right down to the core
We still go on

Watching the time bomb ticking away
Watching the time bomb nobody cares till it's too late
Watching the time bomb ticking away
Watching the time bomb you better pray you're somewhere safe

Oh, we got a time bomb ticking away inside 
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry

All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Billy Taylor,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,1959
Billy Taylor,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1959
Billy Taylor,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love

Billy Taylor,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Sighing sigh after sigh

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one

I who thought I knew the score of it 
Kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it 
Hey teach me tonight 

The midnight hours come slowly creeping 
When there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping 
Single in a bed for two

What I feel is hard to articulate

You'd better teach me tonight 

What do you get for lessons

Billy Taylor Trio,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me

To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

it?
Yes, Ches. We used to sit on a seat with the Thames 
Embankment behind us. You had a newspaper and read the headlines.
That's quite right, Bud. I've still got that paper. D'you 
remember the date? Nineteen hundred and twenty-six.
Ches, read those headlines again.
Ah, here's one. Gertrude Edderley, eighteen-year-old American. 
First woman to swim The Channel.
Listen to this. Cricket. Ashes for England after fourteen years.
Irish woman, Violet Gibson, shoots Mussolini in the nose.
Oh! listen. Churchill's unpopular budget. Five per-cent tax on 
all legal bets.
Charlie Chaplin not to retire.
Second time in history, Atlantic flown by three Spaniards.
Here's one. Death of Barbara La Marr, film actress with five 
husbands.
BBC asks for nine shillings instead of seven-and-six for wireless 
licence.
Hopes of return to penny post.
Listen to this, Ches. Bookmakers in a bad way.
Ah, that'll be the day, Bud, well, things are a little 
different now, aren't they?

In the hills of Caroline

I always thought that we would marry
One sweet day she would be mine
But Hattie's gone, to live with Jesus
In the hills of Caroline

If I should die before tomorrow
Just one request if you don't mind
Just bury me right next to Hattie
In the hills of Caroline

Bury me right next to Hattie

Billy Thomas,"I didn't know how love would come around
Walked right up to me and knocked me down
I dropped straight down on my knees
Asked my little girl, honey won't you help me please

Let her in
Let my heart feel love again
Let her in
Don't you know how long it's been
Let her in
Let come and be my friend
Baby please won't you let her in

I know it's hard for you since your mama's been gone
It must be strange to see me carry on
Honey just try to understand
It takes to the love of a woman to complete the heart of a man

Billy Thorpe,"People of the Earth can you hear me?
Came a voice from the sky on that magical night
And in the colors of a thousand sunsets
They traveled through the world on a silvery light
--More--(51%) 
The people of the Earth stood waiting
Watching as the ships came one by one
Setting fire to the sky as they landed
Carrying to the world Children Of The Sun

All at once came a sound from the inside
Then a beam made of light hit the ground
Everyone felt the sound of their heartbeat
Every Man - Every Woman - Every Child

They passed the limits of imagination
Through the doors - to a world - of another time
On the journey of a million lifetimes
With the Children Of The Sun - They started their climb

No more gravity, nothing holding them down
Floating endlessly, as their ship leaves the ground
through the walls of time - at the speed of light
Fly the crystal ships on their celestial flight
On their celestial flight.",Children of the Sun,1987
Billy Thorpe,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye Baby,1994

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,

And Daddy always smiled; took me by the hand,
Sayin', ""Someday you'll understand.""

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and ev'ry mother's son
You better learn it fast; you better learn it young,
'Cause, ""Someday"" Never Comes.""

Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust,
For there were many things I didn't know.
When Daddy went away, he said, ""Try to be a man,
And, Someday you'll understand.""

And then, one day in April, I wasn't even there,
For there were many things I didn't know.
A son was born to me; Mama held his hand,
Sayin' ""Someday you'll understand.""

You better learn it fast; you better learn it young,

Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies 
Except for the few that were there in your eyes 

Dear, as I held you close in my arms 
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms 
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low 
""Darling, I love you so"" 

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn 
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on 
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime 
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time 

Darling, I love you so 

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn 
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on 
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime 
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time",Anniversary Song,1965
Billy Vaughn,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me! 
 
I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,",I Left My Heart in San Francisco,1965
