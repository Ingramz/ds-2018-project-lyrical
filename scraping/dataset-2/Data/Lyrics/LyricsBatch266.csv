Fourplay,"The closer I get to you, the more you make me see
By giving me all you got (Tell me more) Your love has captured me.


Over and Over again, I've tried to tell myself that we could never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel


Lying here next to you, time just seems to fly
I'm needing you more and more (and more and more)
Let's give love a try (lets give love a try)


Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love
In a special way


The closer I get 

The closer I get 

To you baby

The more you make me see

The more you make me see

By giving me what you've got

Your love 

captured me


Over and Over again
I've tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew this was real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know)


My baby, my baby, my baby, my love

Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love (BEYONCE- I wanna see into those eyes of love come closer)
Just a little a closer let me speak to you 
I wanna softly tell you something (LUTHER- Here I am, heres my love, I just want you to come closer)
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear 'cause I wanna tell you something (BEYONCE-I wanna whisper in your ear, so soft, so come closer and)
Move on in real close so we can clebrate
The way we feel about each other's lovin'

Luther-
wanna tell you words, words of love, words that make you wanna

both- 
come closer love,
Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love ",The Closer I Get to You,1994
Fourplay,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1995
Fourplay,"Why can't it wait 'til morning? 
We can talk about it then 
'Cause I've had a drink too many 
And my troubles, well I ain't got any 

Why can't it wait 'til daylight? 
Things will seem much clearer then 
I'm tired and my eyes are weary 
And I just want you lying here with me 

So close your eyes 
I'll make it oh, so nice 

Well I don't wanna think about what we've said 
And I don't wanna know why we hurt ourselves 
'Cause I just wanna hold you so close to me 
It'll take care of itself and I wanna sleep 

So why can't it wait 'til next time? 
'Cause that time may never come 
Stay here with your arms around me 
You're going nowhere without me 

So close your eyes 
I'll make it oh, so nice for you",Why Can't It Wait Till Morning [Remix][#],1997
Fourplay,"Chestnut roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost snipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe will help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all a, glow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And every mother's child
Is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly
And so,
I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety, two
Although it's been said, many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas to you

Fourplay,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Fourplay,"I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change

Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him

Fourplay,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.",Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,2003
Fourplay,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done

I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

The love you took from

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

That someday it would lead me back to you

All my niggaz on the left hand side, I know your high or
I know you came to the club, to not die
All my niggaz in the center, I came to enter
In the, middle of your brain cell, it's me, Hell Razah
Article one, hit the streets nigga
4th Disciple, and we got the rifle

I pull in wolves like Adolf Hitler, for my two brothers
And two sisters, I tattoo scriptures
Love my seed, like I love the Lord
I was thirteen, when I first record, now I'm back with a heavier sword
It's either rap, crack, or basketball
Young kings want to gun sling, and snatch earrings
Eighty seven, it was microphone fiend, and crack king
We used to battle on the lunch room table, before labels
Now they pay us, so the radio play you
You'se a lame nigga, and you know, we know the truth
And we back, and we back in the booth, first recoup
Then recruit, now salute, we on the loose, ain't ready to shoot
Blueberry in our Timberland boot, I'm livin' proof
Tell your A&R we burnin' his coupes
My lifestyle is danger, Hell Razah, let the name linger
Touch my throat, and I cut off ten fingers
The street's I'm from, son, everybody's steamers
Smokers and heavy drinkers, slingers and chain swingers
I'm one of those, Red Hook cats, set up a track
Bring your soul to another world, you'll never come back
It be that government that made us like that, gave me a gat
I be excuses every ghetto inside, is fallen at
Got the chick high off of contact, keep the windows up
Whoever rollin' with me in here, throw your singles up
It's loyalty over money, bitches, and keys
Backstab me, snatch his arms out the both of his sleeves
Chain and command, explained from a brain of a man
We go to war, like the Arabs'll do, from Pakistan
Matter fact, like the Sun of Man would, from Bethlehem
Drop a jewel that the children out in school, can understand

All my brothers on the right hand side
I want to make sure why'all leave out this party alive
And all my ladies on the left hand side, that got a drop and
Hold it down, cause we don't got nine lives

Hell Razah, Get Large Productions
Revolution music, Rebel Music, baby

[Chorus]
It's Rebel Music, put your mind into it
Right hand in the air, before you solemly sware it's

The next rap level to music, step your paint game up
And if not, then keep moving
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""

O.G.'s, and they young seeds
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music, Rebel Music's on my side always (it's what I keep by my side)
Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always
You'll be back like young black geronimo jacks
With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""
Afro picks, black leather gloves and Cadillac's
Marvin Gaye tracks, straps like Ron O'Neal

Rest in peace, Bobby Seals, Bobby Seals
Lived to die, for revolutionary music, rest in peace
Tupac Ashata Shakur, get up, stand up
Lived to die, for revolution music
Rest in peace to all the brothers in the ghetto
Didn't make it, get up stand up, don't give up the fight
Lived to die, for revolution music
Said get up, stand up, revolution to the only black
Sun of Man, the son of god
Get up, stand up, rest in peace, to all my brothers Tard and Clint

We'll watch it rise and shine forever

If you got some work that's soft
If if you got some work that's soft

You need a whole thang just text me
That white b**** she sexin' me
Let me find a pot let me see that soda
Get the f*** up out the kitchen, you don't like the odor
I'm taught well learn from a soldier
My cousin sold it my uncle smoke it
When I was twelve one day I stole it
Made a couple dollas I couldn't control it
Hustl'n hustl'n
I been cookin' and whoopin' it
I been duckin' and dodgin' 'em
It ain't right but I'm pushin it
Judge told me I'm pushin' it
F*** the judge cause I'm pushin' it
My lil boy need diapers and my old lady she full of s***
I be on the hot stove where the pots go
Get the scale out, Joe watch the door
I'm Chicken Shack, I'm Popeye's, I'm KFC it's rock and roll
Rollin rock, these patrollin' cops
They don't even knock, they come in with glocks
I'm a pull a Pac, I'm a drop one
Cause a whole brick they'll hang Foxx
That white thang cost nice change
Bout 50k'll get you in the game
You got it soft, I'll make it hard
Get a whole bird for Lebron James
You might say I should be a cafeteria worker
The way I whoop over that stove when I'm full of the purple

[Chorus: x2]
If you got some work that's soft then I can make the s*** hard
If you got some s*** that's hard then I can make the s*** hard
If you got some s*** that soft then I can make the s*** hard
If you got some work that's soft
If if you got some work that's soft",Soft To Hard,2006

You turn to whipping white
Then grab and whip it right
Get the cake blender, and the cake bowl
Cake mix, baking soda now the cake swole
I'm the bank, don't believe me check my bank roll
Stacks baby! Perfect timing keep it white so it ain't gold
You wanna see some magic? give me the compact
Hot water hit the plastic then it jump back (abra cadabra)
I'm a turn them white pies into n**** pies
Now they hypnotized, and they got bigger eyes
And we got bigger rides, with the bigger tires
On the strip we make grip like grip flies
Matter fact my block hot like french fries
Will I stop? I think not I gotta get mine
I'm the goon doctor give it to me I can fix it
I got a large appetite I need a meal ticket

[Chorus: x2]
If you got some work that's soft then I can make the s*** hard
If you got some s*** that's hard then I can make the s*** hard

You need a whole thang just text me
That white b**** she sexin' me
Let me find a pot let me see that soda
Get the f*** up out the kitchen, you don't like the odor
I'm taught well learn from a soldier
My cousin sold it my uncle smoke it
When I was twelve one day I stole it
Made a couple dollas I couldn't control it
Hustl'n hustl'n
I been cookin' and whoopin' it
I been duckin' and dodgin' 'em
It ain't right but I'm pushin it
Judge told me I'm pushin' it
F*** the judge cause I'm pushin' it
My lil boy need diapers and my old lady she full of s***
I be on the hot stove where the pots go
Get the scale out, Joe watch the door
I'm Chicken Shack, I'm Popeye's, I'm KFC it's rock and roll
Rollin rock, these patrollin' cops
They don't even knock, they come in with glocks
I'm a pull a Pac, I'm a drop one
Cause a whole brick they'll hang Foxx
That white thang cost nice change
Bout 50k'll get you in the game
You got it soft, I'll make it hard
Get a whole bird for Lebron James
You might say I should be a cafeteria worker
The way I whoop over that stove when I'm full of the purple

Fresh like candy paint
Sharp as a razor blade
Gotta stay playa made


A couple carrots in da earlobes 
Dat gliss gliss gliss

Gotta a mama up in here 
Dat I miss miss miss

I ain't used to have nothing 
Now I'm rich rich rich

To da bently from da cutlass
Now dey pissed pissed pissed

We blowin purp in da front
Dey pourin yak in da back

A couple gats in da back
And ain't none of us gon rat

If I ain't already ripped them
My brother Boosie done flipped them

We got high like a missile
And we be clean like whistle

I lay dat dick a winner
Just ask my girls in Virginia 
The just can't stand when its all up the screen in the center

I be wit Pimp, we be pimpin
San Francesco to Memphis 

I cut the baddest lil bitches 
And if you get when I'm finished

I just talk lil shit
And its a hit when I'm finished

Drop the top when its pretty
Pop the six in a minute

Trill Fam in da building 

We gon need some more space 
'cause money stacked to da ceiling

Big gangsta since double Guinness

Used to shop in J.C. Pennys 
But now I be on some playa shit 

Used to wear dem J?s
But now I be on dat gator shit 

Lookin like a million
So niggas be on dat hater shit

Shootin dice wit niggas wit businesses 

Flya dan yo grandma

Same fella used to rock tees?s
Now wut da difference is

Now I'm on some grown man shit 
And I ain't need tha rent

Takin pictures wit Ebony

And Steve Harvey, Susan 
Not yo average celebrity 

I mingle wit tha richest
To pictures wit broad bitches

Didn?t you see on television 
Wit a ass like Delicious

You can't keep me out da mirror

Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
I sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-ta's perkin, You're Makin Me High
Like Toni, work me, take me I'm hot

Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?

Breathin heavily but still in control
Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said

Get caught, think not, light Brown,

I came up fast in this crap game they call a rap game.
What the damn, she's killin it again from that dame.
Now every snake, fake-faced, o' jig;
I'm like, just don't sell me the bridge, I buy lakes.
Friends even bend rules, chicks I lent jewels,
Says, ""She's actin' funny now, oh, she's got money now.""
Tryin' to do my thing, y'all, need you on my team,
But you ain't gon' stop my dream, or block my cream.
I liked things better when you called me Ings,
A year before Rap City, way before Screen Scene.
'Fore they knew who Foxy was, you probably was
The first to keep it real, wit' all my secrets concealed.
Things got ill the minute I got a deal,
And my time got shorter, and you was havin' a daughter.
Had to stop hopscotch, get off, I ran;
Damn, I wish we were still playin' jump.

If I could take this back, I would.
If I could rewind the time to when it was all good,
I would take it back to when we said good-bye.
If I...
If I could take this back, I would.
If I could rewind the time to when it was all good,
I would take it back to when we said good-bye.
If I...

My so-called man thinkin' he slick 'cause I stay on tour;
Thought he'd never get caught tryin' to play on whores.
I cried, as my keys was scrapin' the car doors,
From the trunk to the hood, by the wheel and the floor.
Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide,
Said you forever keep it real, but you lied.
Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na
Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?""
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it.
No Diggity, don't stop, get busy.
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes,
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code.
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses,
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin' my toes?  
As I realize you was just misleadin' me,
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me.

[Chorus]

Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead.
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lie instead.
On the one to one combo, told me you'd die for bread;
That's why I spend these nights, cryin' in the bed.
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread.
I tried to intervene, you said it was over my head,
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man.
Right, but I'm tryin' to keep you in my life,
V.I.A. satellite, talkin' them burn outs.
Soon you had me wilin' and you turned me out,
Taught me 'bout how to win, the code of the streets.
Luxuries and wealth untold, it was sweet.
And one night you asleep after work, was chopped up,
Felt somethin' strange in my veins, I popped up.
One foot in the house, shoot flew to the horn,
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone.

Mamaow

From the most lethal conglomerate on wax
Foxy Brown, AZ, Nas Escobar, and now introducing
Cormega the Executive

This how it went down
Add to undergrowth therapy, now surgery
A nigga wetted me but, he didn't murder me Dunn
I survived, he thought that I died
Now it's time to throw the nine clip in, mission revenge
Once was friends, but that shit's dead
That stupid motherfucker shoulda shot me in the head

And now for our feature presentation
TrackMaster Entertainment in conjunction with Violator Entertainment
Bring to you, Foxy Brown

Ya know somethin' Foxy?
You're headed for the top, top,
Straight ahead

Of course me, I threw the gas, thug nigga turnin real saucy

Saturated up in Alize, you ain't a threat nigga
So get big nigga baby girl crossin over send your soldiers

From monkey, motherfuckers, that want to rip
Get your shit split, pushed back, grill that ass don't look back
Respect this, like a Lexus repo man I took that
Five cats to death dog, like shop I'm gonna set more
Handwritten obituaries vocal through my chords
Lights out... just pull the nines out
Let's find out, pointin shook ones, they pointin dimes out
It ain't hard, straight up and down, you get your deck pulled
My hand is full, of fake niggaz I position
Expensive intuition fuck a rap competition
Gat expo, get a grip and never let go
The tet blows, the rapper Noyd said, ""That ass is wet though""
Triple P, paranoid plus petrol
Scared to death, put the pedal to the metal
Ghetto connections, Audi 4, take your section
You only get once chance, ain't no second guessin
We blessin, peepin your style, them never testin
Lessons of life walk the night witcha weapon

Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape

Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown

See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the French tubs
Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga

Remember them days you was dead broke
But now your style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flippin' weight, heroin and shit
You know my pussy is all that
Thats why I get begets 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Vendell I'm ringin' bells
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best a shit
Specially when I'm flippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mami's
I push the Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit
When you was in letters and bullshit berettas
And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island
All them collects have me vexed
But when you come home
Knew I was comin' off wit half of dem checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes
Holdin' this grip cocked the green and the shit
Fuck's no, I see half the dough
Made you into a star, pushin' hundred thousand dollar cars

The love that you're givin'
Is just blowin' my mind
The way that you are movin'
Girl I read between the lines
Are you ready (oohh)
Things are sweaty (oohh)
Oh just let me (oohh)
Love you all through the night, oh just

Take me, hold me, real tight
Ohh, all throught the night
Touch me (my baby)
Feel me (my baby)
Baby I promise that I'll make
Everything all right
(let me love you)

Chorus

[Foxy]:
Anything that be gliterin' ain't gold
Any bad bitch that you ran up in ain't old
17 with the mean thing try me
See me in the Coupe with my Phillopean mommys
If you say we could play slow
Get toed while the liquer flow
Crystial not Moe
Boo, after the show we could hit the telle-flow
Get your back blown out
In a black thai-hold baby

Take me, hold me, real tight
Ohh, all throught the night
Touch me (my baby)
Feel me (my baby)
Baby I promise that I'll make
Everything all right

Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
Cause who's getting played is not me
""Surely you jest,"" she said, ""if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""
I said maturely, ""You right
But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine""

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me

Double cross you they got to triple cross me

They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
that you was, throwing rocks, at the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine

Foxy Brown,"Verse One: Nas Escobar, AZ the Vizuliza

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in the Firm
I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time
There were wise guys everywhere, we were around
Twenty one, twenty two at the time
Yeah every place we go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars just for keeping
The ice cold, yeah we were legends and we still are

Two hundred fallen angels, we balling from every angle
Heavy bag gold, panamania changed angle
Let's tangle, tabernacles
Ill lukiens coming at you, fuck Parus
A billion years B.C., originally black Jews
Cashsews honey now roasted, let's kill the colprate
He owe us shit, toe toe toe with that four four bit
Fuck the hoe shit, mercury back tax ?birth? for me
Personally I existed when Earth was in need, indeed
Human lifeform transformed from light storms, poltrons
Electrons nuetrons, iced long
Nights long, repltilaians I'll see ya'll in the next millennium
What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Caribbean
Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambiants, love fine carats and cars that launch
Nonchalaunt, usually there are Jimmies up in the palms
Play low style, Guteians change my whole profile
Left the dope pile, bet the guard be around for awhile
Firm Islamic, hit the croner of the Earth just like a comet

He was the type of guy who routed for the bad guys in the movies

Die for this Firm, live for this Firm

From ki's to ported grams, these are corners in the blue van
E's upon on us, cause of warrants 
While we smoke hash cheese enormous, stack cheese
Travel the world like Taurus, went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camdon, we handlin' to D.C.
Chips on fights with China White's by they tight PP
Wanting PC but all they get is good dick or four clips
For loose lips, by the jungle flise
Suck the pearl tongue juices, off you fly misses
Take her out to the Spark's stakehouse, gentelmen style
Coincidental, family's here
Meet fem fatale, French connection
Persian wet don, let's get this ""F"" on
The Ebony queen, Fox you grab my left arm
Dre made a QB the conton, BK and so on
Family strong ???? Nature, make sure we all get this millionaire's paper
What a sweet site for sour eyes, may we rise
Hope for now on we never cross sides

Rock BDS's on the left wrists, trick check this
Respect this, Firm's niggas lie knee deep in this bitch

Fuck and take the chair for 'em, whoever dare cross us
The thoughts that thoughts across a bitch's minds, pops the nine
Leave 'em resting in peices, while my thorough bitches peep this
Death before decid-a, screw me on the dick-a
Lace me in Gabanna, peep dat
Think I'm flippin' on these three cats, 
Set yo clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G's, stash the guns for 'em
And the icedy E Berkee, breathe the the sun for 'em
Long dick style, swallow the enemies cum for 'em

Fox be the classiest, the sassiest
The clubs, all thugs grab my wrists, offer me moselle Crist
More of the shit to hold you with
Keep hatin I'ma fold your bitch
Should've known to control that chick, hoes mad 'cause I roll the 6
Doe full of ices, black Isis
Sidewalk, my niggas stay fuckin your girl
The rest be, hoes in stretch jeans with red seams
Take it from me, let a nigga dream
Make em lick that, get the cat for his cream

Chorus (x2)

It's about time I reverse that
Bitches learn game, rehearse that
It ain't no love, ma remember that
Ya hoes want to slap while I got him on his back

Think you're grown, half the niggas sittin at home
watchin the kids, while you're gettin it on
I'm too smart for that, caught you creepin
Receipts in your Prada bag, sweets every weekend
Spendin my doe, I coulda spent that on hydro
You ain't slick enough, think I don't know

Dumb ass, think I slept on your bum ass

Yeah, huh (nigga uh)
Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?
See what I see
(Nigga uh, nigga, nigga, nigga uh)

At the age of fourteen, introduce to coops
Learnin' how to seduce niggaz takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, and nice braids, flaunt it
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'high price' life

While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them
With mo' fame than them, they know who they are
This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke

You was my sister, who used to dream together
How we could make it real big, do our thing together
Huh, Thelma & Louise together, remember them days?
Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak
Went our seperate ways, seperate lives
Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game
About to forfeit high price life, I can't afford it

My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams
Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap-thing
Age 4 in my mother's shoes, swore I could sing
And even as a little girl I was doin' my thing
Uh, confused, I ain't asked to be born
Nigga so dumb, shoulda used a condom
Ask mommy every day, when daddy gon' come?
But he never showed up

I would pimp for them, became demented, then men?
Resented them, just the scent of 'em made me earl
'Specially the baller ones tryin' to buy me with pearls
All I needed was love, all I wanted was love

Lack of love had me fallin' for thugs
The niggas who ain't care, just like Daddy
If he ain't care, why should they?
For this 'high price' life, it's the price I pay

Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?

That ain't keepin' him, 'specially if he in love with another chick

Spit in faces, I never seem falsely accused
While some say it's rude
But if I was a dude, they all be amused
But I'm a woman, so I'm a bitch, simple as that
Double-standards, call him a Mack, call me a hoe
Say I'm in it for the dough, but tell me
What tha fuck he in it for?

Wanted it all, now it's all mine
Loneliness, sorrow, confusion and pain
Nightmares, headlines, ""Rapper found slain""
If it wasn't for my moms I'd drown in this pain
Now ya'll see what it's like, ya'll don't wanna be me
Cuz it ain't always what it seem on TV

Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands

I'm making anthems, got a million niggas bouncin' to it

bad meaning good - DAM I'm so hood

Being cocky is just a part of the vibe
I might stop and holla and pop my collar

I'll be all over the news if this gets out
So HOT that the press might ban me
Now how bad you wanna know if I'm sweeter then candy?
What would you risk? Would you put up the car?
Taste my na na in the rain on the hood of your car
Or the back of the plane, {nipples} all out
Bent over the sink with my panties in your mouth
When my dark skin complexion steps in
Won't take no questions to get him and the
thought of Fox give him an erection
to get real stiff at the sight of my {tits}

Yeah, you know its been a long time since y'all heard my voice

The sound was broken, too many years being political
Its kinda hard to do when everything your seeing is critical
Is all my fault what they said in the news
But its funny how the public seems to get it confused
They act like they ain't got nothin' better to do
All they want is a statement, the hattin' is blatin'
But we never paid attention to those who hate us
Til my face was on the cover of all the local papers
But still un-phased, I kept my cool
Plottin, carefully, every step I choose
And my, Cool-whit poin, and my write finery
Everybody want to know my side of the story

Dear Mommy, I apologize  
I know it's because of me that your life is traumatized (and)
it's cause of me that at times you want to die
But you was always there when your little Na Na cried (and)
When the media said Foxy's ill  
You was there when this fame almost got me killed
When I was in the hospital, could not be still
Only you knew the reasons why I popped these pills
And to my friends I love them and I know they care
But, time after time, you was always there
When I did the Vibe cover, holdin my crotch
I was wailin, while you prayed for me hopin I'll stop
Sorry for the times I didn't tell the truth
And I'm sorry for the times when I yelled at you
I love you mommy, sorry that's happened

My cold deed the ear to my heart
Just writing this tears me apart (see)
Seemed like yesterday when I signed my deal
Brought the Benz, and put you behind the wheel
I wanted you to know that I did it for us
And I wanted you to know I was committed to us
And of course the long way, we had our disputes
You didn't care for some of the things that I would do
But you still watched my back, complete and the same
You're the one that used to school me, and teach me the game (see)

I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggaz stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe

The book of love will open up, and let us in

Feel like I've got this black cloud hangin' over me
It's like this pain is takin' control of me
Every move I make, determines my fate
Feel like I'm dying slow, and that's the shit I hate
The constant pressure, the bullshit rumors
The outcast, I'm the one they love to badge
When the records stop sellin'
And the crowds stop yellin'
All I have is me

Bet you thought I'd die without you
But see how I'm still living
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here, with another one
Even though I felt crumbled, I made it through the rumble
Torn apart, a young woman scorned
Coping with the pain, nearly drove me insane
In the hospital, crying in the pain
All types of medications, flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
Take, these broken wings (these, broken, wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free
When we hear, the voices sing (I will learn, I will learn, how to fly)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Please, understand I'm a human first
And before Foxy Brown, I'm just still Inga
And my family, is my whole life
And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger
We survived through the roughest stones
Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors
And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong
All through the rough times, through the pains and storms
And, it's like when it rains, it pours
All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do
Five years committed, y'all just don't understand
No career, no fame, meant more than my man
And, to my fans that slept through it all
Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all
Even when I nearly lost my mind
Some remained loyal, ignored the headlines and

[Chorus]
Take, these broken wings (take, these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (let em fly, let em fly)
When we hear, the voices sing (voices sing)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Story of my legacy, this can't be life
Lord, I feel like I'm fallin'
Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind
And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?
And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?
Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt
My personal problem, stays in my home
Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em

[Chorus]
Take, these broken wings (these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (I want to see them fly)
When we hear, the voices sing
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Take, these broken wings (take these broken wings)
And let them fly again (oohh)
And let them live so free (let them live so free, so free)
When we hear, the voices sing (yeahh)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Teach me how to fly
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh)
Teach me how to fly
I believe, in the power, of love 
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Can't you hear me, don't you hear me? 
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh)
I'm calling out to you

Foxy Brown,"[Intro: Young Gavin]
Fox Five, let's go

[Verse One: Foxy Brown]
See it ain't no party like a Fox Brown party
'cause a Fox Brown party don't stop
But them bottles a pop, when Fox Five come through in the drop
With chinchilla on my back, it's the King {bitch} of rap
Catch us ?, up in bungalow eight
Rollin' through in the cranberry SK8 and
Call the crew, tell 'em come to the crib
I did my time, it's all water under the bridge
I got knocked and it felt like a part of my life
But I'm, back home I'mma party tonight
Through the pool party since no-one else is home
All my friends happy for me tell me ""Welcome home"" and
Yeah I know I got busted for a crime
Now I'm tryna have fun and make up for lost times
The world is mine, I'm so refocused
But I'm back this time and I'm back to grind, so

[Chorus: Red Handed] (Young Gav)
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun (let's have fun then)
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun (I like that)
We drinkin' on the liquor til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me (what you drinkin'?)
We drinkin' on the liquor til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me (I like that, c'mon)

[Verse Two: Foxy]
And, this is how it's 'sposed to be
No police, all night, hopefully, 'cause
we got Armadale vodka too, I got
one of my homies on the ones and twos and
The food is banging, the hate is gone
The speakers blasting the latest songs
And all that time they had me alone
Now I'm, with my family, I'm happy I'm home and
We two-stepping 'cause it's back in style
My friends laughin' and acting wild
See this type of thing, happen all the time
But you gotta get yours, just like I'm gon' get mine
Everything is fine, with my friends I pack a whole place in
For one day I forget the probation
I won't stop til the party is done and see I'm gon' have some fun!

[Chorus]
[Red Handed]
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party, 'cause a Fox Five party don't stop
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party, 'cause a Fox Five party don't stop

[Verse Three: Foxy]
Yeah I made the crime, but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'mma take my shine
You see I made the crime, but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'mma take my shine, so, yeah
I can't forgive 'em, I'm living my life different
I'm seeing just what I'm missing, I ain't tryna go to prison again
They got me on constant watch, but
anything is better than to be on lock

From the cradle til' now, still Fox, just a little more mature
Seen it with my bare eyes, did it all before
Been through hell on earth
Playin' out my role I was given since birth, receptin' it well

Go hard at them critics, they expect me to fail
Work hard for my fans, they expect me to sell
They suspect I'm livin' well
But they don't know the pain I feel

Five minutes away from gettin' killed, it's ill
My moms always hug me when I'm leavin'
I wake up cryin' because death bugs me when I'm sleepin'
Jam Master died, it's like I ain't done grievin'

Big and Pac gone and look we still beefin'
And son even, we at odds in these days
Where niggas die over cars and they chains
I thank God that I'm saved and I'mma hold it down in this game

Now, from the cradle to the grave

I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way

From the cradle til now, I been through it all why'all
Y'all don't know half the things, I been through it dawg
Pain and sufferation, I been through it all
My heart's still cold, I been through the storm

Confused all these years, shit, we grew all these years 
I remember me and you on the stairs
Talkin' bout what we gonna do when we're big
Money came into play and best friends went they way, shit

I wish it never had to go that way, uh
The price of fame can cost a whole friendship
Yeah we got dollars, but it's senseless
So I pray to God for forgiveness and ask him to carry me through

All the stress and the drama in this business
I bare witness, I Fox, and keep going strong until my heart stop
And keep flowing strong with a ?rap pon coc?, see'mon

[Chorus: Althea]
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way

[Althea]
As a little girl I wish I knew that I
Would be goin' through the drama that's in my life
All the sufferin', everywhere I been
How I get myself in all this bullshit I'm in

[Verse Three: Foxy Brown]
From now til' the grave, I look back at my life
Smile and say ""wow"" in amazement
All these roadblocks, wonder how did I make it
Wonder how I 'came famous, I'm impressed with me

It's like rumours been obsessed with me
But the truth never told, it was left with me
And what's left for me, is to extend my hand
If they don't reach then I'll let them be

I got to live my life right
But I wouldn't change how I lived my like 
If I could live my life twice
Y'all don't understand what Inga's life's like

A black stressed, I turned my back to the world
And now I'm back to the world, this black girl's blessed
Yeah, my fans helped me through it
I was destined to blaze from the cradle to the grave
Thank God my fam helped me through it (c'mon)

It's ya girl Fox Brown and I'm comin' through ya town
Know what I mean, but for Luther I'ma keep this clean, yes (oh)

[Verse One: Luther Vandross (Foxy)]
Could've died when I found out we
Couldn't live together peacefully 
That's when it started and we nearly parted
Well I was hoping not to see that day
We started getting in each other's way 
Maybe it's better, we don't live together

Things got strange, my space to chill became half the size 
You became, someone I didn't even recognise (what)

[Chorus: Luther (Foxy)]
What's the matter now? (y'know)
What you talkin' bout?
If it ain't one thing, it's another (that's right)
If it ain't one thing, it's the other (whatever)
Why you gotta put me down?
What you complaining about?
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another (Dutty)

Oh, oh (what) oh, oh, oh, I remember
{And I was like that when you left me}

[Verse Two: Luther (Foxy)]
I remember when, I got a yacht for a dinner cruise
The way you treated everyone was rude
And I don't believe ya, you're such a diva (that's right)
I told the waitress we wanted wine {uh huh}
You got upset because the girl was fine 
You're complicated (you know), but somehow we make it

I get tired, from all I have to do to keep you satisfied
Get no sleep, you call me in the middle of the night and weep

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Luther] {Foxy}
I guess I can't see the wool through you're eyes {yes, uh}
(Pretty little brown eyes) {yes}
I guess I don't understand what goes on, goes on, goes on {LV, baby!}
In your mind

[Foxy Brown]
Now Luther what you mean if it ain't one thing, then it's another
Look brother, we took a vow to cherish each other
And I, been through the storm
But you keep disrespecting and ignoring me
I swear, won't be long til I'm gone
But, ain't nothing worse than a black woman scorned
I move with integrity, it's hard being a celebrity
And loving you is like a Gift and a Curse
You ain't gotta think twice, 'cause I'm leaving you first (uh huh)

[Chorus: x2]

[Foxy]
I must admit that at times I talk slick
But I'm the woman of this house, my best defense is my mouth
And, I give you good love, I cook you dinner 
And like Halle and Denzel, your wife is a winner
So on, you chose your bed so sleep in it
I should've known from day one, but I was so deep in it, so
Since what I'm saying, is going in one ear and out the other brother
This ain't your house, get the hell out!
And leave the keys and the drop top Z behind
You can't diss me, then expect to keep what's mine
So keep thinking you can use and abuse me

Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
Cause who's getting played is not me
""Surely you jest,"" she said, ""if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""
I said maturely, ""You right
But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine""

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (say what?)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine 

A year gone, and she seein' things most chicks only
Hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
 If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'
(She replied, eyes open wide)
(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life
(Right)

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (say what?)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine 

If I needed would you, give me your kidneys?
Catch a case you catch it with me? (fo' sho')
Pawn your jewelery to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
 that you was, throwing rocks, at the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my Sunshine

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (say what?)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)

Cashmere fabrics never caught in last years garments 
Holsters under armpits chauffeurs and the charms lit 
And the coders holding on the dons wrist

The only thing that changed is my ass got more fat
But my titties been crazy baby
You ain't gotta ask who back, you soft bitch move back
Had BK on my back, even Shawn couldn't do that
I cruise all slow in the S-Class down Classen
Pullin' up in traffic on Nostrand and Patchin'
I took six years off, I let em have rap and
Y'all bitches played with it, I came to snatch it back then
Put it back on the project bench
And made every gangsta nigga want a dark-skinned bitch

You wanna hit? (You wanna hit?)
Gimme an hour plus a pen and a pad

Yo, I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet takin a shit
My style is all that, and a big bag of chips wit the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your click holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If ya if was a spliff we'd be all fucked up (Word up!)
No need to ask you who is he, Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard of many ruff cities (Chicago, LA, any of them)
I'll have to Norman Bate ya I love ta hate ya
Cause you'se a freak by nature
Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight wit no chaser (Word up!)
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggaz try to over react
The L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp (Word up!)
Break your concentration, murder your camp
For the jealous, overzealous, we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggas coming through and acting wild
Y'all commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile
I shot ya!

Yo, I conversate wit many men, it's time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew, hey yo you hear me friend?
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body
Secret society, trying to keep they eye on me
But I'm stay incogni', in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D.
It's sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real
Yeah you motherfucking right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fucking title read
You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some, kids feeling guilty bout the,
But you first baby girl so just face it (alright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (kid)
Everything is real not just a song that we sing (word up, it's real)
From my life to the paper (what), very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (shine baby, just shine)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I shot ya fagot ass

Now who the fuck you think you talking to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Running this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seeking, for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter, at any ad out, that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Now that the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture (what the deal pop)
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Ceaser

Thug niggas give they minks to chinks
To' down we sip drinks rockin minks, 
Flashing rings and things (what the deal)
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep, macking
Doing my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggas for they cheddar
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy banging 
Like Versace locs pops (what the deal)
Want ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks
I'm sexing raw dog without protection, disease infested
Italiano got the Lucciano
I gets down fucking with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop

To lay low, I play slow
Roll with the Firm, Mafiaso crime king pin

What the fuck? I thought I conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee, Hammer, and Ice-T's girl
But still, niggas want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for ya bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be debate
Niggas fight, glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?
Light shit, niggas slip now how the bullet feel?
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfucking ass hang

I'm taking you back
Here's another one

Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you

I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night

Watch me while you crave me 
Firm like Nature Foxy Nas and Az 
Truly reasons to bug the tooty in 
Keep laced and feel them watch you 
But make sure that you're one of a kind 
And you deserve to be my sunshine 
Chorus: 
You touch me with a heart of gold (uh huh) 
I can't go a day without my sunshine (sunshine) 
Touch me with a smile of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine 
Sunshine (uh uh uh uh) 
Keep her repressed at all times 
Cats with love, they creep (uh huh) 
Just to say they 
Crept with mine, slept with mine, she said 
I ain't deaf nor blind niggas stress hating 'cause they're less than 
mine 
They want to sex me 
We chose each other 
You acted like you chose me 
They oppose you they oppose me 
We could creep at a low speed 
The gat in the hoisery, double cross you 
They got to triple cross me 
I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be 
One more thing 
If I ever go broke 
You hit the block for me, she replies 
Eyes open wide 
Put that on everything 
I put that on my life 
Right 
Chorus: 
You touch me with a heart of gold (uh huh) 
I can't go a day without my sunshine (sunshine) 
Touch me with a smile of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine 
Sunshine 
If I needed would you, give me your kidneys 
For sure 
Catch a case you catch it with me 
mm for sure 
Pawn your jewlery to come get me 
You better know 
Catch me with a chick 
Forgive me? 
Now that, well I don't know 
This is the truth I shall 
Go to the loot get swell 
I put this on my neck 
You was from the smallest to the dubee 
Me and you balling from heaven go to hell 
Won't let you hit the ground, if I'm falling myself 
I won't be leaving you In this cold world, brawling for ? 
Its me and you old girl, taking the belt 
From the lows to the highs 
To the fold we shine 
Just continue to be my sunshine 
Chorus: 
You touch me with a heart of gold (uh huh) 
I can't go a day without my sunshine (sunshine) 
Touch me with a smile of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine

You gotcha own '96 suh in..the ride 
And keep your ass tighter than Versace that's why 
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me 

They conniving shit

They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks 
And papayas, from the village to the tele 

Time to kill it on your belly no question 
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence 
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot 
Met your death in less than 8 seconds

Back loc?ing tossing petals off of Black Roses/
This is mo gutta, this is more crack/
And I ain?t change, I been the same bitch before rap/
The only thing that changed is my ass got more fat/
But my titties been crazy baby/
You ain?t gotta ask who back, you soft bitch move back/
Had BK on my back, even Shawn couldn?t do that/
I cruise all slow in the S-Class down Classen/
Pullin up in traffic on Nostrand and Patchin/
I took six years off, I let em have rap and/
Y?all bitches played with it, I came to snatch it back then/
Put it back on the project bench/
And made every gangsta nigga want a dark-skinned bitch/

My reps for the boostin? bitches with them bags full of aluminum/

While you were rocking out
Who'd of thought your smorkus board
Would be hard to live without

If we could do it all again
Just another chance to entertain
Would anybody watch or even care
Or did something break we cant repair

They may have been unbearable but
I still loved your jokes

FR. S. Rudin,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1993
Fra Lippo Lippi,"Draw the curtain,
Blind the light
Say nothing
Beautiful night

When we hear them, 
We will call
When we wake up,
We will fall

Grey forever,
Rainy sky
Facing window,
Fragile smile
Quiet evening,
Quiet life
Silent moves in
A beam of light

To find a way
He tries everything

Fra Lippo Lippi,"Holy Holy Holy
Was the groundest tall of all
The light across the ocean
Shall brighter than before
Come to take your last look
Across the barren land
Come to pray for miracles
Beneath the western sky
Little pile looks to the sky
Wind size from the north
Sun deeps down on time of face
Burns in silent ties
It sails its own for rain tonight
'Coz this could be the last
Come to pray the miracles
Beneath the western sky
*Even as I tried to speak
I cannot find the words I say
I only want to say to you
I only want the best for you
'Coz your the one who make me see
The love was right in front of me
(And) How could I fail to recognize
The caring smile across your eyes
Hey, hello assigned your shell
Do you believe in love
Then roll away the empty stone
Up the hill once more
Wake up and face your life again
'Coz even tall trees bend
No need to pray for miracles
Beneath the western sky

Fra Lippo Lippi,"It's always like this, people I know 
Read many books and save every dream, 
With all of their hope buried inside, somewhere 

And somewhere a man cries for his love 
A love that is lost, that withered too soon 
With all of his hope buried inside, somewhere 

Shouldn't have to be like that 

So all you can say is we need more time 
To get through the things that need to be said, 
With all our trust buried inside, somewhere 

And even if it takes a lifetime of trust 
To build something strong, what happens to us 
With all our faith buried inside, somewhere",Shouldn't Have to Be Like That,1985
Fra Lippo Lippi,"So maybe I lose my heart
Is that so much to shout about
I spent the nights counting the stars
This kind of love is not the love
That was given to us
The distance between us is everything now


Every word getting stranger
Now that I see the paint of you 
Every move getting weaker
You're the gesture I feel from you
No more lies could make me believe
I'm helpless inside of it all


Cause in this crazy world
A pleasure those, and I don't want
I need to know where I belong
I only want to see what this has done to you and me
Afraid if I turn on with nothing at all

",The Distance Between Us,1986
Fra Lippo Lippi,"Everybody, sit down and listen
Want to tell you what you've been missing
Secrets, big, big secrets

Angel came out till now
And vanish without a warning
Angel, like and angel

[Chorus]
And when she moves
The way she glides across the room
Just like an angel
I wish that I could see her one more time
And when she moves
The way she glides across the room
Just like an angel
I wish that I could see her one more time

She plays a game of longing
Sympathize some big time living

That every time I come back here
And feel the smell of country air
It's heaven, my own heaven

Fra Lippo Lippi,"Over there, just beneath the moon
There's a man with a burden to keep
Now sleep will fall, washout, rags and
Paperbags, homes and lives passing by

Who will see the beauty in your life,
And who will be there to hear you when you call.
Who will see the madness in your life,and who
Will be there to catch you if you fall.

Dreams run wild, as lovers find their way
Through the night. not a care in the world.
And over there, oh the twinkling of the lights
Harbour lights. say goodnight one more time.",Beauty and Madness,1987
Fra Lippo Lippi,"See it in the eagle flying
See it in a snowflake falling
Feel the wind right through your hair
Now take a bow and have your share

See it in the children playing
See it in a steam of laughter
Memories might fade away
Let's celebrate a brand new day
Cause life will call out and sing
Life makes it hard not to believe

And why should everybody need to know
Every single why and how
Got no other, need no other
Means to carry on

See it in the evening colours
See it in the open wheatfield
Swaying softly in the breeze
With all the grace and all the ease

See it in that crazy moment
When all is one and one is all
It's everywhere you'll ever go
It's everything you'll ever know
Cause life will call out and sing
Life makes it hard not to believe

And why should everybody need to know
Every single why and how
Got no other, need no other
Means to carry on",Crazy Wisdom,1987
Fra Lippo Lippi,"Somewhere the horizon draws a line 
Between the sea and the sky
And in that line of land
You'll find a heart no rain can wash away 


The sun slips in, it's beautiful
It's everything at once
An open field a line of trees
A right for one and all


This is where we live
This is where we breathe
This is where we sow
This is where we reap
This is where we live


Walk the promised land
And ride the waves upon the floaming sea
Live are but with the hands and not with words 
But words can make you see


The sun slips in, it's beautiful
It's everything at once
An open field a line of trees
A right for one and all

Fra Lippo Lippi,"He will paint the light and shade colors and the trees
He will climb the steepest hill believing what he sees
He will lay down on the ground beneath the old oak tree 
He will sleep forever if you try to set him free 
Sail on the wings of a cloud where to well nobody knows
And cry, cry if you want them to see, die every day to be free
Be proud, to wear the colours that you call your own

Be loud, speak out when you want the world to know
Be strong, hold the flame for everyone to see
Be weak, if you want to love

When you knew all along
That you had to go

How could you watch me sleep
So close to you
Pretending not to know

How could you memorize
My name
And forget who I am

How could you think
You're still the same
Believing I can

It's too late to start pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later than the sunset
Later that the rain
Later than never to love you again

How could you ask for more
With an innocent smile
Trusting me to stay

How could you close the door
And leave me here
Supposing I'm okay

How could you breakdown
My disguise
And uncover my fears

How could you look into my eyes
Ignoring
My tears

It's too late to start pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later than the sunset
Later than the rain
Later than never to love you again

It's too late for a new beginning

It aches me from inside
And then it beats me til im blue

Just staring at the sea

I guess i could always try to pretend
But i know it isnt true
All that ever comes back 
Is my fear of losing you

To fill the sails and to set us free, set us free

And where are you now and what will you do

Girl the time has come
To make all your wishes
And burn, burn, burn, burn, burn all your bridges.
And hope they remember you,
As something more than just a failure.
Something more than a lock without it's key
Cause that was me.

Maybe we should just hang it up
We were so close
They said we were so far

Well we swore by now we'd have them wowed
But we're still stuck in this race
With hopes and dreams undone

We got lost somewhere they're not in
Do you remember when
We said it would never end
We won't go back down
This time around
Stop where you are and wish
Little things couldn't kill this
Count down from ten
We could be back to go again

Maybe we started phoning it in
But then again the numbers didn't    Quite make sense
They don't lie
Give me a thousand lies

And this isn't a song about candy
But were still suckers the same
They fell for your lies

Fran Warren,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1957

Pour qui vient chercher la fête 
Qui veut se tourner la tête 
Appelez-moi Maggie, appelez-moi Maggie 
Mon domaine c'est la nuit 

Et j'aurais pu rencontrer 
Celui que j'aurais aimé 
Par une belle matinée 
À l'heure où je m'endormais 
Appelez-moi Maggie, appelez-moi Maggie
Mon domaine c'est la nuit 

Mais je ne fais que croiser 
Les cœurs démolis, usés 
de ceux qui veulent oublier 
Leur vie dans l'obscurité 
Appelez-moi Maggie, appelez-moi Maggie 
Mon domaine c'est la nuit 

Les batteurs frappent comme des sourds 
Dans les disques pour danser 
Mais je me lèverai tôt, un jour 
Pour vivre et tout recommencer 
N'appelez plus Maggie, n'appelez plus Maggie 
Ce matin elle est partie 
N'appelez plus Maggie, n'appelez plus Maggie 
Elle est partie vivre sa vie",Chanson de Maggie,1977

Ces amis de passage

C'est bon que tu sois là 
C'était comme une urgence 
Dans ces affreux combats 
C'est bon que tu sois là 
C'est comme une évidence 
Dans mes yeux qui se noient 
Je remercie ma chance 
En répétant tout bas 

C'est bon que tu sois là 
Mais qu'est-ce qu'on nous demande 
Mais qu'est-ce qu'on veut de nous 
Qu'on supplie, qu'on marchande 
Qu'on se mette à genoux 
Comme les chansons s'envolent 
Moi je voulais te dire 
C'est bon que tu sois là 
C'est comme une délivrance 
Dans ce monde qui se bat 
C'est bon que tu sois là 
Dans cette indifférence 
Où c'est chacun pour soi

Où l'on oublie qu'on boit 
Dis-leur ce que tu penses 
Dis-leur ce que tu vois 

Dis-leur quelle est leur chance

Est-ce que tu sais quand il est là, tu sais quelle chance tu as

While my heart aches
How I long for what they have
Tonight the only thing between us
Is the words we've yet to say
And I wouldn't have to dream tonight away

From the rooftops to the underground
There's nothing but the lonely sound
Of no one there
I hear sweet singers singing songs of love
Singing what I'm praying for
Lord hear my prayer
Oh I'm just staring at the ceiling
And I'm looking at my life
And what I see is something isn't right

Tonight the only thing between us
Is the words we've yet to say
And I wouldn't have to dream tonight away",If Love Had Wings,1995
Frances Black,"I can face another day alone
I can listen for the telephone
Funny how you never know
What may come and what may go
All the things that never show
I am waiting, even though

Three times you said it's over
Two times you said goodbye
But once you said you loved me
Was that a lie?

Empty is the tunnel that I'm in
Can't see where I am or where I've been
Should I stay, or should I leave?
Is there something to receive?
At the dawn of the eve?

Tell me, what should I believe?

Does love run out?
Does love dry up?
Does anybody know?

I'll close my eyes
I'll hold my breath
But I won't let you go

It's a feeling I have known before
Holding the right key to the wrong door
Though the train has jumped the track
Though the daylight has turned black
Though my heart sustained a crack
I still want the feeling back",Once You Said You Loved Me,1997
Frances Black,"If you get out in the driving rain, stand in the eye of a hurricane,
And never think twice.
If you turn your back on selfishness, and your thoughts are for someone
Else
'Cause they changed your life.

That's how you know it's love,
That's how you know it's meant to be.
When the span of forever, just never seems long enough?
That's how you know it's love.

Then your heart, insists that you give it all
And you no longer fear the fall and you just let go.
When the past, is finally dead and gone.
Faith leads you somewhere to the one that has your soul.

That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever, just never seems long enough.
That's how you know it's love.

No part of you questions, no part of you doubts
You're only sure this is what love's about
Nothing or no-one can stand in your way or keep you from saying
What your heart is dying to say.

That's how you know it's love,
That's how you know it's meant to be.

Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot

What are my arms for?

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2006

You do something to me
You send chills right through me

Frances Gershwin,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Frances Kelly,"It was cruel of you to stand at my door and take my hand
Like a drowning man I clung to my defenses
And ten years is a time but your looks, love, it's a crime
And I lost my tongue in the tangle of my senses
And I never was to know that I'd come to miss you so
But time winds down and I turned my back long ago

But I still dream, oh darling I still dream
Oh I still dream, oh Lord knows I still dream

On the killing floor I stand with a stun gun in my hand
Like a cowboy shooting badmen on the range
And nothing satisfies and the soul inside me dies
As I duck each punch and never risk the change
And now you look at me with that same old used-to-be
Oh but time winds down and I turned my back long ago

But I still dream, oh darling I still dream

Ah but now you look at me with that same old used-to-be
But time winds down and I turned my back long ago

Frances Langford,"Skies were gray that rainy day
We parted in the lane;
Was it tears that fell or was it rain?
There we stood as lovers would;
Did parting bring you pain?
Was it tears that fell or was it rain?
I couldn't tell if your eyes were misty,
Or if you felt regret,
I noticed when you kissed me
That both your cheeks were wet.
Till we meet again, my sweet,
That memory will remain.
