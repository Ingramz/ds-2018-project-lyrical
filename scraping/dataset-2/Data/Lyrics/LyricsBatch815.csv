Parliament,"We are children of production
Produced in conjunction
With the urgency of our Dr Funkenstein
In his widsom he forenotioned
The shortcomings of your condition
So, we the Clones, were designed
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind

We're a flawless testimony
To the attainment of the P.Funk
Endowed with conceivement of true groove
We are deeper than abortion 
Deeper than the notion
That the world was flat when it was round
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind 
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind 

We're a biological timebomb
Exploding in a timezone
And almost everyone is out of time

We are children of production
Produced in conjunction
With the urgency of our Dr Funkenstein
In his wisdom he forenotioned
The shortcomings of your condition
So, we the Clones, were designed

Parliament,"I was strung out on Bach
And Beethoven was my thing
I dug jazz, I dug rock
Anything with a swing
Then I ran into a friend Who told me there was so much more
Find the void that you missed
There is plenty to explore

We want to take you, Cholly, when we go
(You want to take me?)

We'd like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(Well, if you'd play me just a little bit more)
But if we play you just a little more
(Maybe I will)
We'd love to take you, Cholly, when we go

You know right about that time I started
To analyze what they were trying to tell
Me, they said: ""Come on, Cholly, we want to
take you somewhere""
I didn't know where
They was trying to take me, next thing I
Know they were saying something like this:
Funk, gettin' ready to go-
Funk gettin' ready to roll (what?)
Funk, gettin' ready to go-
Funk gettin' ready to roll
(What in the world are they talking about?)
Funk gettin' ready to roll-gettin' ready to go?
No, they can't do that

Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll-see I've Bach-I love Beethoven
Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll

I would dance, I would sing,
I could get lost in my dreams
I would fly, but never too high
'Cause my funk deserted me
Now that the door is open wide
And all my funk just can't hide
With the syndrome left behind
No, my funk just can't hide

We like to take you, Cholly, when we go
We like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(They promise they would play one more time)
But if we play you just a little bit more
We'd like to take you, Cholly, etc

You know
It was in my hands
It was in my feet
I got it all over me
Yes, I did, I got it all over me
Got to go, got to go
Got to go with the funk

Get ready

I would waltz, I would sing
I would get lost in my dreams
I would fly but never too high
'Cause the funk deserted me
Now that the door is open wide
And my funk I can't hide

Parliament,"Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh, hear my mother call
Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh, hear my mother call

I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, ""Father, father it's for the kids (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Any and every thing I did.
Please, please don't judge me too strong.
Lord knows I meant no wrong.
Lord knows I meant no wrong.""

Then the devil sang

""Would you like to dance with me? (Ooh-ahh-ooh)
We're doin' the cosmic slop."" (Ooh-ahh-ooh)
(x3)

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!

Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call

In you ear for a minute, quit complaining
'Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's

I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin' it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
You should be gettin' it, gettin' money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnny Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him 
Get your kids in school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California

You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out

Think positive, everything else is old
And work hard, never stop hustlin'
'Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin'

It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
'Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They want to keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good
And you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand cause I know I can
I keep going and goin' but I'm not the pink bunny
I'm not beatin' on a drum I never stop thinkin' money
I'm gettin' all I can if you don't ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds

Images of drenched survival
Without hope but soaked with pain
Consequences of reality felt
All conditions of humanity built
On the bridges
Tent villages waiting for the state to help

Glass barely bends before it cracks
Embedded down into our path
Paved in the crimson of our tracks
Without the chance of turning back

Before the water gets too high 
Before the water gets too high

If the clock strikes midnight
Then what becomes of our demonstrations?
To which fate have these gatherings fell?
Which halls echo all the chants we yelled
Into faces on the coins we tossed into the wishing well?

Drinking water on which we subsist
Mixing into rivers that did not exist yesterday
When all the warning signs were there but sorely missed
What’s it worth all the money we made
Floating idly in a newborn lake?
Far above financial centers
Cities sink like market rates

Glass barely bends before it cracks
Embedded down into our path
Paved in the crimson of our tracks
Without the chance of turning back

Before the water gets too high
Add up the bribes you take
And know time can’t be bought
By the profits that you make
Before the water gets too high
To float the powers that be
Or is it someone else’s job
Until the rich are refugees?
Before the water gets too high",Before the Water Gets Too High,2018

Parquet Courts,"Making the distinction between life and lore
Odds favor the former when you wear a mask
Masochism forming in the reflection and
I’m trying not to turn into a psychopath
Better to have lost it then to find it tossed out
That’s what I’m telling myself
Wasn’t I better than nothing?

Making a decision about steamed or fried
Wanted to be needed so I fed my cat
Think I’ll keep to myself for the next few days
Feel a buzz that can’t be bottled, smoked or canned
Sabotaging life just to find something to write about
Why was it always this way?
And did I do it on purpose?

Waking from a vision that the schizoid built
Listening to puddles swallow melted snow
Spring has sprung and finally it’s not cold outside

Parquet Courts,"I’ve learned how not to miss the age of tenderness
That I am so lucky to have seen once
And now that I’ve become older I’ve learned how to brush over
My history and how it’s sequenced

When I think about you I see a person who
Hasn’t existed for a long time
Before you started using, before I starting choosing
To do the same thing for the same reasons

The first name I called you is not a name at all
More of a duty than a function
Often an execution, often with deep confusion of
‘Who was I when that name was just mine?’

Like a serpent charmer negotiating harm
I live with a basket of your silence
And as the years record I can feel it growing board
But I keep the top on in the meantime

When I pass my reflection there isn’t any question of
Where the person in it came from
When I catch myself thinking and hear the voice that speaks inside
I know where I got my brain from

Every step I’ve strayed from and followed
Led me to the same location
Every act I’ve forsake and borrowed
A delivery to now
And I’ve never wondered how I came to be
I feel free like you promised I’d be",Freebird II,2018

Your sad our goodbyes sound nostalgy
Your chords swung me from idolatry

A vow even is impossible to keep
Every day is starting on the balance beam
Still you're standing with me, always carrying
The melody

Something you can’t find in a store

But we’ve come to increase time in between ticks
And there is romance in the slow dances
'Cause they’re fertile in hush, futile in haste
These are your nerves, this is how they taste

Well I can’t count how many times I’ve been outdone by nihilism
Joined the march that splits an open heart into a schism
I cower at the thought of other people’s expectations
And yet still hand over mine to them

Travel where you are, tourism is sin
These are the ruins we left behind, you can’t take pictures of them
If what they say is true, then you become what you chew
If it decays spit it out, affectation is a drought

That you wait through when you hate everything that you do
You wanna live outside the groove, then fine
But it’s there like a flower blooming in your ears
Open up your mouth, pollinate your peers

It tempts us to become lost in its darkness

Just before you were told that you didn’t meet
The standards of integrity that this organization strives to maintain

Why are there no folk songs about ATM machines
That produce the likeness of the blazer of the trail of tears

Used in portraits of chairmen of boards and

through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me

Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head

You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half

Crushing, cranial, contents

Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

Suffer, and then you die
Torture, pulverized

At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me

Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue

Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay
Did you see him hide, did you see him crawl

I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave's chicane
Staring as she called my name

No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Can't move, it's an ebbtide
Morning, don't get here tonight
Searching for her silver light

And I can't get it out of my head

Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

And Ivanhoe and Lancelot

In dreams the world keeps going 'round and 'round

Well he just stood there mumblin' and fumblin'.

Go out and find yourself a wife.

was very pretty, he thought he was in love,he was afraid.

Thursday: Asks her for a date,the cafe down the street 
tomorrow evening,his head was reeling,
when she said. Yes O.K.

And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides

As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind

Come se fosse terra
Cancellerò quei segni
Dell'ultima tua guerra

E brucerò col fuoco
Quest'erba tua cattiva
E ti farò con l'acqua
Più fertile e più viva

E pregherò che il sole
Asciughi questo pianto
E pregherò che il tempo
Guarisca le ferite

Poi costruirò una serra
Intorno al tuo sorriso
Farò della tua vita
Un altro paradiso

Sarò il tuo contadino
E tu la terra mia
Combatterò col vento
Che non ti porti via

Poi spargerò il mio seme
Nella tua verde valle
E aspetteremo insieme
Che venga primavera

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
On the half shell they're the heroes four.
In this day and age who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with mugging mysterious.
All police and detectives are furious 
'cause they can't find the source of this lethally evil force.
This is serious so give me a quarter.
I was a witness. Get me a reporter.
Call April ONeil in on this case eh.
You better hurry up.  There's no time to waste.
We need help like quick, on the double.
Have pity on the city man it's in trouble.
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger when 
Tonto came pronto when there was danger.
They didn't say, ""We'd be there in half an hour.""
'cause they displayed Turtle Power.

Now our ace reporter was hot on the trail,
determined to put these crooks in jail.
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened but before she knew it,
she fell in the trap and got caught.
Yeah, she was all alone, with no friends and no phone.
Now this was beyond her worst dreams 
'cause she was cornered by some wayward teens.
Headed by Shredder, they were anything but good.
Misguided, unloved, they called 'em ""the foot.""
They could terrorize and be angry youth 
and they'd mug the people who needed proof.
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound.
Shouting ""Cow-a-bun-ga"" as they hit the ground.
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower 
'cause they possessed Turtle Power.

When you stand for what you believe in, 
and find the strength to do what's right, that's Turtle Power!
Heroes on the half shell, they're on a mission.
When there's a battle got the enemy wishing that they stayed at home instead of 
fightin' these Ninja Masters with moves like lightnin'.
They were once normal but now they're mutants.
Splinter's the teacher so they are the students.
Leonardo,Michelangelo and Donatello make up the team 
with one other fellow, Raphael.
He's the leader of the group, transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop.
Pizza's the food that's sure to please.
These Ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese.
Back to the story, it's not hard to find.
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind.
Those were the words that the Master instructed 
but a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted.
 
That was the last straw. Spring into action.
Step on ""the foot"" now they're gonna lose traction.
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice.
Your shell is hard so you shout, 
""They can't dust us off like some old coffee table.""
Since you been born you been willin' and able to defeat the sneak, 
protect the walk, fight for rights and your freedom to speak.
Now the villian is chillin' so you make a a stand.
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand.
Remember the words of your teacher, your master;
""Evil moves fast but good moves faster 
than light shining for your illumination.""
Good versus evil equals confrontation.
So when you're in trouble don't give in and turn sour. 
Try to rely on your Turtle Power.

Come and get headline, destined to get riches
From either rappin our ass off or brick shipments
Cover all regions, makin sure the protty gets spread out
We talk behind the mac you bust lead out
Wit next prospect, no particular concept do we follow
Smooth but yet solid like marble

Niggas ain't fuckin wit D, fuckin wit me
Lookin at me like ""Yo, what can it be?""
In the wide body-7 while you suckin the D
Spent out in the wedge while I'm fuckin for free
Scared to death like you stuck in a tree
I'ma stretch your ass out like I'm cuttin the deed
Frontin like a big man but you stuck in a three
So you know your floss game ain't nuttin to me
When the sun hits the cross, yo it's something to see
are-be	, Kid Capri niggas runnin wit me
Twenty karats on the wrist ain't nuttin to me
Do you know good frontin to me, nigga

[Kid Capri]
Aiyyo Tone, let's Touch these niggas wit the wand
Then blow up like a bomb
Made moves faster than the autobond
The Kid Capri is a institution, and all ya'll niggas is pollution
Starin up a whole lot of confusion
It's simple, let's move out all these corn cats
And disc jock dissin MC's that got the borin raps
Fuck what ya got, grimy niggas don't want to hear it
Niggas take it, soon as they near it, you better fear it
Bronx Bomber, the pretty-fly girl charmer
The black Italian, the cash keep pilin as I'm smilin
So hear me now, I bring the thunder plus the rumble
And I'll step back and watch your whole career just crumble

Well it's the cheeba steamer, brains on trains, won't eat her neither
Benz to the plane, off the plane to the Beemer
Insane and off the meter, in the rain I'll heat up
And ya'll can't stop my sunshine, fuck one-time
Got heavy wit gats to push your face back
Trash-ass album sound like you played it on eight-track
Rip you from the roots and under
Triple gooses in the summer
Mean long guns is producin the thunder
Convertible Hummers, we shit on the glock
Try to put the roof up, I'll tell Show to piss on the top
Wrist on the watch, roll wit a click or a glock
Plan on gettin a lot, from spittin or not
Cool wit niggas that be flippin a lot
Probably got shit on your block
And if you hate, I'll take it back to '88 (Nigga, get off the top)
It's two-g's, let's get this money, you wit it or not
But I'll switch topics like my bitch wit thongs in the tropics
Make hits, straight hits
Perform as long as I got it
Seven-digits wit my name on the dotted
Remain Dirty and potted, ya'll know me for the ruckus
G.D. I only can fuck wit
Get the dutch and tell Tony to Touch it

[Party Artie]
Guns, I tote them things
Blunts, I smoke them things
Rhymes, I wrote them things
It's no such thing, as hoes fron-ting
We run train, I do my thug thing
Grab the mic and leave a mud stain
So get Tide wit bleach when I rhyme wit beats
Niggas do crimes to eat
No pork, I don't talk, the nines just speak
I'm the kind to creep on your block wit the heat cocked
Got the street locked, smackin niggas out they Reeboks
It's Party Artie, I get dirty wit the Ewoks
The infrared hit you in the head from three blocks
Away, Been There Done That like Dr. Dre
It Ain't My Fault like Silkk the Shocker say
Ya'll niggas gots to pay, shots'll spray
From the Bronx to Far Rock away
My whole team, strapped like Bokeem
Fuck bein in jail, trapped wit no cream

[Lord Finesse]
I be the don that's known to have the style sewn
More cheese than calzones, give chicks the dialtone
Build like brownstones when we slaughter your plan
Touch albums, so hot comes wit a portable fan
Type to starve the mic when I hog the light
Lay my life on the lines if the odds is right
Gettin the, spot and gleam while you plot and scheme
To stop the team, three words nigga: watch and dream
You just mad hater, 'cause we movin wit dough
You don't make sense like wearin suede shoes in the snow
Finesse frontin? why'all know me, I don't stress nuttin
Bought your album, that's how I broke the eject button
Don't stress dudes, we just plot our next move
Make niggas look stupid like joggin pants wit dress shoes
The prophet, shit john blaze like the tropics
Type of nigga need a ? just for my pockets
Don't flex punks, we sex stunts, collect lumps
You flossin now, you be pardon by next month
Type of thug, yo I was born to bug
Waitin for us to fall, nigga join the club, what",The Club,2000
Party Arty,"It's the number one crew in the area

The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

It's the number one crew in the area, known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard

Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

It's the number one crew in the area known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard

Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people

A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped

One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit

Party Tyme Karaoke,"There's a port on a western bay
And it serves 100 ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their lives

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
And she serves them whiskey and wine

They say,""Brandy, you're a fine girl
What a good wife you would be
You could steal a sailor
From the sea.

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the
North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved.

He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home.

Brandy, you've a fine girl,
What a good wife you would be
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea.

Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailing stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory,

But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand.

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

Brandy, you've a fine girl,
What a good wife you would be
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea.",Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) [As Made Famous by Looking Glass] [Version],

Party Tyme Karaoke,"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long.
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song.
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed.
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read:

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean.
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine.
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad.
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad.

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne.
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape.
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape.""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place.
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face.
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew"".

""That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne.

She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Well when you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did it happened just this way
The day my mama socket it to the Harper Valley PTA
Yeah my mama socket it to the Harper Valley PTA
My mama really socket it to the Harper Valley PTA",Harper Valley PTA [As Made Famous by Jeannie C. Riley] [Version],

Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?

Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same

We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines

Party Tyme Karaoke,"There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he sees an opening
In a conversation about the way things used to be

Well, I'd just roll my eyes and make a beeline for the door
But I'd always end up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor
Hanging on to every word
Man, the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school, uphill both ways
We were cane-switched raised, and dirt-floor poor
'Course that was back before the war

Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
That's a chin held high as the tears fall down
A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out
Like a small-town flag a-flyin'
Or a newborn baby cryin'
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

Son graduatin' college, that was mama's dream
But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18
'Cause when you gotta fast car you think you've got everything
I learned quick those GTO's don't run on faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.
Working maximum hours for minimum wage

Well, I fell in love, next thing I know
The babies came, the car got sold
I sure do miss that old hot rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed of how I turned out
Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said, let me tell ya right now

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million
Just be thankful to be workin'
If you're doing what you're able
And putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

And if all you ever really do is the best you can
Well, you did it man

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on

Party Tyme Karaoke,"I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is""

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first""
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

So I've been tryin' to slow it down
I've been tryin' to take it in
In this here today, gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

Party Tyme Karaoke,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if It's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade?
Blew ever dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hanging out
They said somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?

I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now, let me tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride
 
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Party Tyme Karaoke,"VERSE 1
On a warm summers evening, on a train bound for nowhere, I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns at staring out the window at the darkness, till boredom over took us and he began to speak, He sais ""Son I've made a life outta reading peoples faces. Knowing what the cards were byt he way they held their eyes. So if you don't mind me sayin I can see your outta aces for ataste of your whisky I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow, then he bombed a cigarette and asked me for a light. And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expresion said If your gonna play the game boy you gotta learn to play it right.

CHORUS:
You gotta know when to hold them,
Know when to fold them,
Know when to walk away, know when to run.
You never count your money when your sitting at the table,
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealings done.

VERSE 2
Every gambler knows that the secret to survival is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
Cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
And when he finished speaking he turned back towards the window, crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. 
And somewhere inthe darkness the gambler he broke even. And in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty

Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen

Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar

We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away

I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way

Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way

Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history

Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

Party Tyme Karaoke,"I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
 
I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me
 
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
 
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars

Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me

Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs

Blow my money for me

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

To pick up the phone 
And call after a couple of
Drinks,
And say,
""How you been?

That maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me.""

That they just can't help but want,
And even though we just can't make it work out,

An' I may hate myself in the morning, 
But I'm gonna love you tonight.

I know it's wrong, 
But it ain't easy moving on.
So why can't two friends remember the good times once again?

Tomorrow when I wake up, 
I'll be feeling a little guilty, an' a little sad,
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad.
An' I guess that's what it is, 
In lonely late night calls like this, that we try to find
An' I may hate myself in the morning, 
But I'm gonna love you tonight.

On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you

The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dream came true 

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill

Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more

She ain't got none

I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low

Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Carvin' up the chicken for dinner

Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah

Down near TSU

You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school

Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit

No shadow where evil may hide

Who told you you're not fit to stand beside me
All the songs I sing when you're undone
And joy is made fall in the salvation

As time slips by
I stand alone
While you gain the world
But lose your soul
I long to say the words to make to turn from lesser things
I long to light your path to keep your feet from stumbling
My eyes on the horizon oh if you could know
How I wait to see your distant shape, my prodigal come home

My child return you've not gone too far to forgive
Why did you first yield your heart
To things that tear the soul apart
Along to speak the verse this one was dead and is now alive again
 
Where are you why are you hiding
Who told you you're unfit for abiding with me
Songs are sung from broken bones
And truth has cleansed you white like snow

And I've loved you when you least expected it
You should know I'm waiting here and I've always been

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush

Et je me tuais mon chagrin

Loin de la France que tu as perdu
Pour mourir sur d'autres chemins

Assis sur notre barricade

J'étais couché sur le pavé
Et cette main que j'ai serrée, serrée

C'est toi contre moi
Et moi contre toi

Mets-toi contre moi

En solitaire, en silence
Si je n'ai pas su l'écrire
Je voulais simplement te dire

Que si, si j'existe
J'existe
C'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Si j'existe
Ma vie, c'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Sans répit, jour et nuit

Mais qui peut dire je t'aime donc je suis

J'en ai connu des hôtels
En attendant un signe, un geste
De ta part

J'en ai suivi des galères
Pris des trains, fait des kilomètres
Pour te voir

Mettre un nom sur un visage
Derrière une vitre, un grillage
Quelque chose à retenir
Faire comprendre avant de t'enfuir

Que si, si j'existe
J'existe
C'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Si j'existe
Ma vie, c'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Sans répit, jour et nuit

Mais qui peut dire je t'aime donc je suis

Qui peut dire qu'il existe?
Et le dire pour la vie

Que si, si j'existe
J'existe
C'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Si j'existe
Ma vie, c'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Sans répit, jour et nuit

C'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Si j'existe
J'existe
C'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan

C'est d'être fan
C'est d'être fan
Mais qui peut dire
Je t'aime donc je suis
Mais qui peut dire
Donc je suis
Donc je suis
Qui peut dire?
Qui peut dire?
Pour la vie

Je suis fan",Fan,2004
Pascal Obispo,"You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see

Pascal Obispo,"Sur les coteaux en pentes
Les vallons amoureux
Un rayon de soleil
Est passé sur nous deux
J'attendais de ce ciel
Qu'il me fasse juste un signe
Et je vois mon château
Sortir du cœur des vignes

Tu es mon millésime
Ma plus belle année
Pour ce bonheur en prime
Que tu m'a donné
Je suis à jamais ta terre
C'est ça être père

Après autant d'amour
La saison des vendanges
On récolte le fruit
Le meilleur des mélanges
La bouche est ronde et pleine
Et le nez si discret
Quel prénom allait-on bien pouvoir te donner?

Pascal Obispo,"Qui peut prétendre me connaître?

Pour toute une vie qu'on veut bien faire,

Je suis comme je suis, et j'aime comme j'aime,
Même si j'en paie le prix, je suis comme je suis
Je suis mes envies, comme me suivent ceux qui m'aiment
Je rêve comme je rêve, plutôt mal que bien,
Parfois même à rien, je suis comme je suis
En tout cas je n'ai
La prétention de rien

Qui peut prétendre avoir la clé? De mon enfance et ses ratés,
Rangez tous vos clichés qui rassurent, des blessures à vif sous l'armure,

Mais qui peut prétendre encore prétendre avoir un jugement à rendre,
Et pouvoir s'regarder en face, dire ce qu'il aurait fait à ma place,

Quand moi-même je cherche et m'y perds, pour tout un cirque qu'il faut bien faire

Je suis comme je suis, et j'aime comme j'aime,
Même si j'en paie le prix, je suis comme je suis

Pascal Obispo,"Tout commence dans le silence,
Et le noir autour de soi.
A peine un souffle qui s’avance,
Un murmure à demi-voix.
Comme pour marquer la cadence,
Juste un claquement de doigts,
Qui rappelle en évidence,
Que le rythme vient de là,

Et plus rien n’a d’importance
Plus rien ne compte autour de soi
Comme si tout devenait magique.
Hm, quand j’entends la musique

Tu es ailleurs quand elle t’appelle
Comme beaucoup d’autres hommes infidèles.

Quand elle est là, j’existe pas
Te souviens-tu encore de moi?

Comme un homme à qui l’on dit je t’aime.
(Quand j’entends j’entends la musique)
Quand elle est là, je sais déjà
Plus rien ne compte, tu m’oublieras!

Puis un accord qui s’élance,
Une guitare qu'emboîte le pas,
Sans battage ni violence,
Sans trop savoir où elle va.
Et puis soudain se déclenche
Des cuivres qu’attendaient que ça
Comme on attend une avalanche
Avec tous un cœur qui bat

Et plus rien n’a d’importance
Plus rien ne compte autour de soi
Comme si tout devenait magique.
Oh, quand j’entends la musique.

Sur le fil du rasoir,
Des amours illusoires.

Au lieu d'aller à l'école
On sentait par ces éléments
Qu'il était différent

Et la jolie maison neuve
Mais lui, son regard déjà était
De l'autre côté du fleuve
Il était loin loin, loin loin

En lisant les circulaires
Il rêvait souvent, le vent
Soulevant la poussière
Dans les rues, dans mon métier
Je n'étais là qu'à moitié

Tellement de noms, tellement de visages 
Tellement de gens qu'on aime leur voyage 
On s’extasie sur écran de trois centimètres 
Sans jamais tour du monde, ses kilomètres 
On collectionne des listes sur ordinateur (universelle solitude)
Ça nous rassure, on a moins peur (universelle, universelle)
Mais ces visages, ces cœurs qu'est-ce que ça cache?
De l'appareil, la crainte qu'on se détache 

Universelle solitude 
On se sent si bien seul ensemble 
Dans nos bulles 
Universelle solitude 
Qui nous retient tout seul ensemble 
Dans nos bulles 
Sans jamais partir à l'aventure 
À l'aventure 

Dans nos écrans y a le monde d'aujourd'hui 
Y a l'amour aphone qui crève d'ennui, le jour la nuit 
Sur ces photos ou comme tout le monde on joue on sourit 
(On s'aime, on rit) 
On fait semblant d'être heureux aussi (universelle solitude)
Tout ce bonheur c'est un genre, c'est sexybition (ohlàlà)
Tellement de muscles et de satisfaction 
On se met tout nu pour pas perdre tous ses amis 
Comme Émilie Ratajkowski (oh, Émilie)

C'est peut être par habitude qu'on vit contre nature 
Qu'on peut plus se voir en peinture 
C'est notre façon d'exister 
À regarder la vie passer  l'automne devant nos téléphones

Pascal Obispo,"Tous ces gens qui attendent un peu de reconnaissance 
Une mainte tendue, un sourire, un geste 
Un compliment glissé dans la poche de la veste 

Tous ces cœurs qui palpitent et jamais leurs noms sur la liste 
Peut-être un jour faut bien se le dire 
Quand on sait que ça pourrait être pire 

L'espoir fait vivre 
L'espoir fait croire 
Au meilleur, au rêve ultime 
Maintenant, car après c'est trop tard

Et Vincent pleure de joie

Seulement son cœur qui cogne 

Et Vincent pleure, c'est beau 
Toutes ces larmes, le cadeau 
D'être heureux un quart d'heure 
Pour un instant de bonheur 
Juste un petit quart d'heure 
Ce soir, ça lui suffira 

Tous ces gens qui attendent un peu de gratitude 
Pour mieux se sentir vivre 
Et qui sait peut-être, utiles 
C'est son tour aujourd'hui pour le plus beau rôle de sa vie 
Sur la scène en déséquilibre 
Au rythme des mercis 
Même si tous ceux qui ont compté 
Ne sont plus là, à ses côtés 
C'est pour eux qu'il a fait tout ça 
Et aux cieux, glisser, quelqu'un entendra

Pascal Obispo,"Rien ne dure 
Neuf mois puis rien n'est sûr 
Acné, premiers baisers 
Combien de temps d'amour à partager? 
Rien ne dure 
Des passions, des secrets 
Ne restent que des regrets 
C'est comme ça, on s'y fait 
On n’a pas le temps d’freiner 
Que la Porsche de James Dean s'envole en fumée 

À toute allure beauté, gloire, apogée 
Dans cette course effrénée 
Et ce bleu qu'il reste à partager 
Tout se meurt avant la vie d'après 
Pour nous simples mortels 
Tout change sous le ciel 
Ou alors il faudrait 
Pouvoir se réincarner 
Quand la Porsche de James Dean s'envole en fumée 
S'envole en fumée 

Rien ne dure même avec son armure 
Serments, fidélité, douceur 
Finissent par une lame dans le cœur 
Liberté, censure, dictature, opprimés 
Aucune guerre mondiale
Ni protocole de paix 
Ensemble retomber 
Et la Porsche de James Dean s'envole en fumée 
Hey!
Qui s'envole en fumée, oh-oh

D'ici jusqu'à l'est de l'Eden 
L’enfance qu’on se traîne 
Freddy, Johnny, Cobain 
Même si ça te fait de la peine 
En attendant que la lumière s'éteigne, idoles, muses et musées 
Les bolides en acier 
C'est juste pour patienter 
Et pour faire des clichés 
Quand la Porsche de James Dean s'envole en fumée 
Hey!
S'envole en fumée

Pascale Frossard,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me

Pascale Picard ,"I hate you as many as you are!

Enthroned on the highest chair, a little
Tiny peek at me and then back to your world
Playing for the staff that couldn't care less
Singing as low as possible but

I hate the way you make me feel annoying
I hate the power you've got on my self esteem
Pieces of my heart shared with strangers
I hate you as many as you are!

This barmaid is a shame to her place, ignoring
That I have asked 20 times for a drink
Thirsty, watching you and your sweet glass of wine
But haven't you seen the no-smoking sign
Swimming in my sweat it's so fucking hot in here
Diving on the rocks you're so fucking hard to reach
Is there a way to get any attention!?

I hate you as many as you are!

You know it's true myself can be the way to see
Words that wouldn't make sense if you were listening to me
Please singer, sing us a song we all know by heart ?cause
We're only open to new radio stuff
I'm also entirely sure my place is not here
I would really enjoy switching places with you
Judging this girl who is only trying to pay her bills

Fuck you as many as you are!

I hate the way you make me feel annoying
I hate the power you've got on my self esteem
Pieces of my heart shared with strangers

I hate you as many as you are!

The sound's bad, the voice is too loud, it's not my kind of music
She's always singing the same songs, sorry if I only know two thousand
Do you know this band? Well, you should, this is your kind of music
It's not my fault if you got nothing else to do but be here 3 days a week
I hate the way you make me feel annoying
I hate the power I give you on my self-esteem
Between a drunk ass and me guess who's the most annoying?!

Fuck you!

Pascale Picard ,"I won?t try to argue now
Anyway I feel there?s nothing I could say
To ease your mind
Maybe there?s nothing exciting outside
But ?round here I?m just wasting my time
Spinning ?round on nothing new
When I close my eyes I remember that kiss
I?d rather keep them wide open
And if I miss that train do you really think
That even here, I?d be closer to you

So here I am leaving soon and
I?m standing at gate 22
?Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know I?m still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know I?ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
I?m leaving but my mind will surely stay
At gate 22

There?s too many dreams I must chase down
Though sometimes I bite off more than I can chew
I know you?d like to keep me near
I know it?s easier to be two
But I can?t plan my life all around you
I?m weaker than I?ll let you know
So don?t ask me to jump this wall
From here it looks too tall
Two people kissing goodbye facing a door
A classic picture we?re all tired of

You know I?m still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know I?ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
I?m leaving but my mind will surely stay

And I already see the picture of that day
When you?ll say you?ll wait for me
And I?ll pretend just then to believe you
I?ll send you postcards for a few weeks and then
Another perfect moment at the wrong time
But the timing is always wrong

I made this promise to me
Repeating to myself 12 times a day
Nobody loves no one, anyway
But someone is still crying
In a corner of my head
And if you believe me when I say I'm alright

This week is gonna end
Make this promise to me
Calling me 12 times a day
But I know what you're about to say
'Cause you may be whispering
But in the corner of my head
The voice is clear, will you be alright?

The more that I hope. the more I keep waiting
The more I get old
In a hurry. I'd rather fix up my mind soon
The more I keep Waiting, the more I fall back
It seems like I'll never get held
By someone, someone exactly like me

What if we bend ?
Breaking all the promises we made
Juggling with words 12 hours a day
12 more and my life's away

In a corner of my head
Making me dizzy but it feels so right

At least find a place to sit
How I enjoy these times

I'm still listening
I'm just a little out of it
Who's that man'
Why did he turn the neon on'

99 messages on your voice-mail
No call-back
My heart nailed to your locked door but
Still no news
Okay, so you're gone
Leave my womb figured it all out
Can't take my eyes off that phone
Remove this ghost behind my back

I saw your girlfriend a few days ago
Pieces of you in my arms

For that touch

Pascale Picard ,"I am not gonna make it
I can see the crowd around me
Is getting bigger, and as it is
I'm trying to figure out
Why I feel so isolated
I have my friends
But don't have much time for them
I have my house
A tiny pocket in my luggage
I have my boyfriend
But he's also so tired of listening to me
Every single day
Seems like a mountain to climb
Every single word
It takes all my strength to get it out
I'm tired of talking about me
But in fact, it's the only thing
I get a grip on

Hey little girl keep on smiling:
Cause they don't want to hear you complaining
You're a lucky girl
Your life's so exciting
So I'll keep on making bad jokes
'Cause you think I'm strong
And it might be the way you like it
Oh how I need you to like me...

I have tried as hard as I can
I have tried to go through 9 to 5
But I was like a train
Between work and bars
Never found out what I was traveling for
Now I have my car
But I ain't got no safe place to go
I still hold my drink
But I'm not as thirsty as before
I have my voice
But I heard lately that people
Don't want to hear sad songs
Every single place
It's all the same to me
Every single face
I know it will be replaced
By another smiley one
Who will also be left soon
Somewhere behind

Hey little girl keep on smiling
'Cause they don't want to hear you complaining
You're a lucky girl
Your life's so exciting
So I'll keep on making bad jokes
'Cause you think I'm strong
And it might be the way you like it
Oh how I need you to like me.

So please now just don't count on me
I can't handle it anymore
And don't ask me why
If you don't want me to lie
But don't be alarmed
Don't you see that I'm just down
Just don't worry
Soon I'll be back on the tracks

Smilin'!
'Cause I'll get tired of complaining
I'm a lucky girl
And I'm doing exactly what I wanted
So I'll keep on making bad jokes
'Cause I need to be strong
It might be my only chance to get out of it
And now I really need to make it !",Smilin'!!,2007

Waiting for the commercial to get another Diet Pepsi
I got 5 minutes between two programs, so I'm already wearing my coat

I'd better be lucky 'cause the government steals all my money

My teenagers are doing drugs and my baby girl wears thongs
I called 3 or 4 times to the open lines to give my point of view about it
I also thought about writing a letter to the prime minister

He has to know that our kids are out of hand because of rap music
And movie cause if they are violent its all their fault
They're too young to tell the difference between fiction & reality

And if they try to do anything to smash our hopes
Dare them to steal that dream from the source

And obviously when you get down they suddenly realize
They are really in a big rush this month

They?ll probably tell you they fought something similar
When they swear they understand,
It doesn?t mean that they won?t try to stop you from getting better

Dare them to steal that dream from the source

Pasi Koskinen,"Truly they lie, they talk utter nonsense
Who say that music reckon that the kantele
Was fashioned by a god
Out of a great pike's shoulders
From a water-dog's hooked bones
It was made from the grief
Molded from sorrow

Its belly out of hard days
Its soundboard from endless woes
Its strings gathered from torments
And its pegs from other ills

So it will not play, will not rejoice at all
Music will not play to please
Give off the right sort of joy
For it was fashioned from cares
Molded from sorrow",My Kantele [Acoustic Reprise],1997

Pasión Vega,"María pensó que el amor 
Era un mandamiento de dos

Se hace vieja ante el espejo 
Y limpia su llanto 
Maquilla sus heridas

Recuerda la primera vez 
Que él le juró que fue sin querer 
Y en los hijos que vivieron 
Prisioneros de su miedo

De los cabellos de oro 
Y la boca de fresa

Es la esclava de su señor 
Ella siempre lo perdona 
A sus pies sobre la lona 
Su patria es su casa 
Su mundo la cocina 
Y se le viene encima

Un día dejó el corazón 
Abandonado en su colchón 
Solo piensa en ver su cuerpo 
¡ay! del quinto mandamiento 
María no tiene color en la sangre 
María se apaga y no lo sabe nadie

Pasión Vega,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario 
Con él las palabras que pienso y declaro

Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano 
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto

So that September she moved across the sea

How your face dropped
How your heart stopped
Sitting at the bus stop when they told you that she'd gone
So you run to the harbour
Need to tell her that you love her
As the boat disappears you never felt so alone

'cause you've blown out all your candles one by one
And you curse yourself for things you never done
Where were you when her hour of need had come?
Now you curse yourself for things you never done

Now your grandson blonde haired blue eyed handsome
Calls you up from London and sits and asks you why
So your answer don't be scared of failure
For the only failure is never to try",Things You've Never Done,2007
Passenger,"I walked the steps of my father today
Worked till I froze and my face turned grey
And all of my fingers calloused and worn to the bone
And I felt like a child in a world full of men
Trying to capture that something again
Strong as an ox but slowly turning to stone

Walking away from this room dark and grey
Smoke hangs in clouds and the old echo plays

And the music is soft
And the voice it is hushed
And the boy he has loved
And the man he has lost

And I walk out in the rain
All over again

I felt the touch of my mother today
Gently pushing me forward again
Closing my eyes but still feeling the way
And I'm clutching at fingers through crumples & creases
I came to my senses it cut me to pieces
'Cause I needed more but I was pulling away

Walking alone with these legs made of stone
I'm almost dry and I'm almost home

Where the photographs smile
And I'm still someone's child
And my place it is set
So I'll stay for a while

Till I walk out in the rain
Like water would stain
And I'm born all over again",Walk in the Rain.,2007
Passenger,"You can say I'm mad you can say I'm crazy
But I'm only as bad as the maker who made me

Sittin' in the darkness lying in the church
Deaf man's silence blind man's search

Tear drop falling memory recalling
Ghost in your dreams in your secret recordings

Mad man's match there's a lump in your throat
Be under your mattress hole in your coat

Singer with the sound down
Winter on the come down
Poets in the overcoat looking for a sun tan
On his birthday prisoner on his first date
Tired of the new wave

I rise to meet you
As your trust is always a shame
All this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints on the path in which I came
I'm the beast and your the beast in me

The doors close in an hour)

You can say I'm mad you can say I'm crazy
But I'm only as bad as the maker who made me

Needle for the user the pain in your chest
Beggar and the chooser the wicked man's rest

Bottle in the hand of a dirty old drunk man

Leaf falling autumn calling
Dark clouds forming

I rise to meet you 
As your trust dissolves to shame
Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints
Off the path from which I came
I'm the beast in you, the beast in me

Bite my nails
Right down to the skin
Where one trust ends and another lie begins

Patch over holes in my weakened heart
Which angels hold
And devils pull apart

I'm the beast in you
The beast in me
The bitterness, the jealousy
The part of you that never sleeps

Will we walk all night through solitary streets?)

What you never had before
And the reason that you're given
Still leaves you wanting more

Through the early winter snow
Your foot prints track you through the grass

And you ache just to smell her clothes
And her cooking down on the stove
You see her face in everyone you pass

'Cause you search for years but you lose everything you find
There's Braille for the deaf and a signpost for the blind

Passenger,"One went out at a bus-stop in Edinburgh
One went out in an English park
One went out in a night club, when I was fifteen
Little lights in my heart

One went out when I lied to my mother
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine
One went out within me
Now I smoke like a chimney
It's getting dark in this heart of mine
It's getting dark in this heart of mine

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away

One went out in the back streets of Manchester
One went out in an airport in Spain
One went out, have no doubt
When I grew up and moved out
Of the place where the boy used to play

One went out when uncle Ben got his tumor
We used to fish and I fish no more
Though we will not return
I know one still burns
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore

And they die along the way

Passenger,"It’s been years
Since we carved our names
On a clocktower door
Before everything changed
We were big eyed boys
With the salt on our skin
And we’d throw our kites to the wind

And they’d fly on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

It’s been years
Since we whispered soft
With the torch light on
And the big light off
We were tired boys
With the soap on our skin
And we'd fall asleep to the wind

And we’d dream on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

Cos we’re circles
We’re circles you see
We go round round the sun
In and out like the sea
I’ll circle round you
You will circle round me

And in years
When the torch light thins
And the clock tower’s gone
And the big light dims

We’ll have lines on our skin
And they’ll throw our dust to the wind",Circles,2012
Passenger,"Well there’s a river that runs through Glasgow
And makes her but it breaks her and takes her into the parks
And her current just like my blood flows
Down from the hills, round aching bones to my restless heart

Well I would swim but the river is so wide
And I’m scared I won’t make it to the other side
Well God knows I’ve failed but He knows that I’ve tried
I long for something that’s safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
I’m as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

Well on one side all the lights glow
And the folks know and the kids go where the music and the drinking starts
On the other side where no cars go
Up to the hills that stand alone like my restless heart

Well I would swim but the river is so wide
And I’m scared I won’t make it to the other side

Passenger,"I know a man with nothing in his hands, nothing but a rolling stone
He told me about when his house burnt down, he lost everything he owned
He lay asleep for six hole weeks, they were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing he said I'll tell you something
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose
Now I've got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt, a whole lot of trouble, he said
But now the money's gone, life carries on and I miss it like a hole in the head

I know a woman with kids around her ankles an a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper and the mother fucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise, keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked so why you gottaworry me for
Now he left a hole in my heart a hole in a promise a hole on the side of my bed
Oh but now that he's gone well life carries on and I miss him like a hole in the head

And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose

I got up and started walking
Down to the end of my street
And on into town
Well I had no one to meet
And I had no taste for talking
Seems I'm talking my whole life

Well I walk past the late night boys
With their bottles in their doorways
And I walk past the business men
Sleeping like babies in their cars
And I thought to myself oh, son
You may be lost in more ways than one
But I have a feeling that it's more fun
Than knowing exactly where you are

Like a stone carried on the river
Like a boat sailing on the sea
Well I keep on walking
Oh, I keep on walking
Till I fine that old love
Or that old love, comes to finds me

Well I walked into the morning
And felt that warm sunlight forming on my shoulders
'Cause it hit with no warning
Like a summer sky storming in my lungs

While the women spend their money
On anything that makes them look young

Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic
The boy laughed at the spastic dancing around in the rain
While laundrettes cleaned clothes, high heals rub toes
Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
Dressed in their suits and their boots
Well they all look the same

I took myself down to the cafe to find all
The boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
And carved out a poem above the urinal that read
Don’t you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you’re given
Life’s for the living so live it
Or you’re better off dead

While the evening pulled the moon out of it’s packet
Stars shone like buttons on an old man’s jacket
We needed a nail but we tacked it ’til it fell of the wall

While pigeon’s pecked trains, sparks flew like planes
The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
And we all had new iPhone's but no one had no one to call

And I stumbled down to the stomach of the town
Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown
With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said
Don’t you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you’re given
Life’s for the living so live it

They take your dreams down and stick them in storage
You can have them back son when you’ve paid off
Your mortgage and loans
Oh hell with this place, I’ll go it my own way
I’ll stick out my thumb and I trudge down the highway
Someday someone must be going my way home

Till then I’ll make my bed from a disused car
With a mattress of leaves and a blanket of stars
And I’ll stitch the words into my heart with a needle and thread

Smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you’re given
You know life’s for the living so live it

We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love
When you've got silicone and strap ons

And beer bloats our spoiled guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us eying up
The what's and ifs and buts and maybes

And falling over in the street
Is just a part of every week

Young and naive I never believed that love could be so well hid
dWith regret I'm willing to bet and say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget
It gets under your shirt like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest but the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling like an old man on the side of the road
'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you want to be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction
There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
Cause all I want to do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh oh

Oh I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction
I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh
It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction oh

Passenger,"Well last night I couldn't sleep 
I got up and started walking 
Down to the end of my street 
And on into town 
Well I had no one to meet 
And I had no taste for talking 
Seems I'm talking my whole life 
It's time I listen now 

Well I walk past the late night boys 
With their bottles in their doorways 
And I walk past the business men
And sleeping like babies in their cars 
And I thought to myself oh, son 
You may be lost in more ways than one 
But I have a feeling that it's more fun 
Than knowing exactly where you are 

Like a stone carried on the river 
Like a boat sailing on the sea 
Well I keep on walking 
Oh, I keep on walking 
Till I fine that old love 
Or that old love, comes to finds me 

Well I walked into the morning 
And felt that warm sunlight forming on my shoulders 
'Cause it hit with no warning 
Like a summer sky storming in my lungs 
Ain't it funny how the kids walk by 
They'll do anything to make themselves look older 
While the women spend their money 
On anything that makes them look young 

Like a stone carried on the river 
Like a boat sailing on the sea 
Oh, I keep on walking 
Well I keep on walking 
'Till I fine that old love 
Or that old love, comes to finds me 

Oh, lo, no 
Oh, oh, oh, no 
Oh, lo, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 

Well I'm like a stone, oh 
And I'm carried on the river 
Like a boat sailing on the sea 
Oh, well I keep on walking 
Well I said I'll keep on walking, oh

I’m not gonna roll it no I’m not gonna smoke it

Twinkling in the silvery night

Two sips of whiskey in the flask but I’m not gonna drink them
I swear I’ll make it last

And the old will be lost in the new

I’ll wait for you

Got a Polaroid picture in my wallet
I’m not going to tear it no I’m not gonna spoil it
It’s an unspoken heartbreak
A heartbroken handshake I’ll take with me where I go

And three words on the tip of my tongue
Not to be spoken nor sung
Or whispered to anyone
'Till I scream them at the top of my lungs again

Passenger,"Tobacco stains our yellow teeth 
And all our fingers and underneath 
Our fingernails, that clasp on sheets 
As we try desperately to sleep 

Hearts are sad and eyes are tired 
And all this Red Bull keeps us wired 
Gives us wings 
It gives us rings around our eyes 

We put three sugars in our tea 
Sit to watch too much day time TV 
And laugh at mums 
Who don't know who the father is 

And all our girlfriends are long gone 
We watch too much internet porn 
Who needs love 
When you've got silicone and strap ons 

And beer bloats our spoiled guts 
And shit jobs keep us in ruts 
And keep us eying up 
The what's and ifs and buts and maybes 

And falling over in the street 
Is just a part of every week 
And we lie drunkenly 
Just staring at the stars 

Remember when they were in reach 
And all the teachers used to teach 
You can do anything 
If you put your mind to it 

We put our minds to it all 
But disappointment crashed the ball 
We could have done anything 
But we just never quite knew it

Passenger,"Well grey clouds wrapped round the town like elastic
Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic
The boy laughed at the spastic dancing around in the rain
While laundrettes cleaned clothes, high heals rub toes
Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
Dressed in their suits and their boots 
Well they all look the same

I took myself down to the cafe to find all 
The boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
And carved out a poem above the urinal that read
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you're given
Life's for the living so live it
Or you're better off dead

While the evening pulled the moon out of it's packet
Stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket
We needed a nail but we tacked it 'til it fell of the wall

While pigeon's pecked trains, sparks flew like planes
The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
And we all had new iPhone's but no one had no one to call

And I stumbled down to the stomach of the town
Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown
With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you're given
Life's for the living so live it
Or you're better off dead

Well I'm sick of this town, this blind man's forage
They take your dreams down and stick them in storage
You can have them back son when you've paid off 
Your mortgage and loans
Oh hell with this place, I'll go it my own way
I'll stick out my thumb and I trudge down the highway
Someday someone must be going my way home

Till then I'll make my bed from a disused car
With a mattress of leaves and a blanket of stars
And I'll stitch the words into my heart with a needle and thread
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you're given
You know life's for the living so live it

Passenger,"Twenty seven years, twenty seven years old
Only thing I know, the only thing that gets old
I gotta sell out if I want to get sold
Don't want the devil to be taking my soul
I write songs that come from the heart
I don't give a fuck if they get into the chart, oh no
Only way I can be, is to say what I see
And have my shadow hanging over me

I don’t know where I’m running, but I know how to run
‘Cause running’s the thing I’ve always done
Oh I don’t know what I’m doing, but I know what I’ve done
I’m a hungry heart, I’m a loaded gun

Twenty seven years, twenty seven years now
Only thing I know
I know that I don’t know how
To please everybody all of the time,
‘Cause everybody’s always fucking changing their minds
A little bit faded
A little bit jaded
Not gonna stop and I won’t be persuaded
To write words I can’t believe in
To see my face on a video screen

I don’t know where I’m running, but I know how to run
‘Cause running’s the thing I’ve always done
Oh I don’t know what I’m doing, but I know what I’ve done
I’m a hungry heart, I’m a loaded gun

Twenty seven years, twenty seven years done
Written six hundred songs, only twelve get sung
Eighty seven thousand cigarettes have passed through these lungs
And every single day I wish I’d never smoked one
A week brushing my teeth and a week getting my haircut
Eight years sleeping, I’m still tired when I wake up
A whole year eating and I still lost weight, fuck
Five proper girlfriends and five messy breakups
Twenty seven birthdays, twenty seven New Years
Thirty thousand quid just so I could have a few beers
Ever dying old hopes
Ever growing new fears
Don’t know where I’m going but I know how I got here

I don’t know where I’m running, but I know how to run
‘Cause running’s the thing I’ve always done, oh
Oh I don’t know what I’m doing, but I know what I’ve done
I’m a hungry heart, I’m a loaded gun, oh

Passenger,"He’s been collecting since the age of nine
Every shiny bullet that he could find
Built himself a house with the wooden floors
Put the shiny bullets in a chest of drawers

Well his wife’s long gone and the kids have grown
And trees they fall down on their own
Memories fade like an old slideshow
But the bullets still shine like coins in the snow

Well one day took himself into town
The men with a truck well they came around
They took the television and the gun from the war
And almost every bullet from the chest of drawers

Well he came back home and found the house in a mess
Run into the bedroom and the old brown chest
Well he didn’t care much for the VCR
But he cried for the space where the bullets were

Well the men took the truck down into town
And they sold all the silver they had found
But they couldn’t sell the bullets 'cause they weren’t live rounds
So they dug a big hole put the bullets in the ground

Well he doesn’t leave the house much anymore
'Cause the men are gonna come like they did before
And he’ll hold onto the three or four
Bullets that they left in the chest of drawers
Well the bullets that they left in the chest of drawers",Bullets,2014

Shining up like coins in a fountain
Hope is a tree sitting on a mountain where the grass don’t grow
There’s a sad old sea but my love is an island
Wild and free like the hills in the highlands
Hope is a breeze that brings me back to dry land
Where the flowers grow

Love is a baby born
Love is the last unicorn
Love is the only song I’ll sing

Hate is a poison
Love is a remedy
Singing out like the sweetest of melodies
Hope is a ghost in the deepest of memories
Stronger than ten of me
Fear is the enemy
In the dark and it creeps like a shark
In the coldest sea
In the deepest part but
Hope is the beat in the oldest heart
A hand in a hand and a brand new start

Love is a fireside
Warm on the coldest of nights
Love is the only song I’ll sing, oh

Love is the truest of words and
Love is the last winter bird and
Love is the only song I’ll sing

Teeth were white and our skin was young
Eyes as bright as the Spanish Sun
We had nothing we could hide

Now my dear we are two golden leaves
Clinging desperately to winter trees
Got up here like a pair of thieves
While the sirens blare outside

What's left to say when every word's been spoken?
What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
What's left to do when we've lost all hope and
What's left to break when our hearts are broken?
But sometimes

Do you remember how this started out?
So full of hope and now we're filled with doubt
A dirty joke we used to laugh about
But it's not funny anymore

I fear I choke unless I spit it out
Still smell of smoke, although the fire's gone out
Can't live with you, but I die without

I'm taking this bike and riding to New York

Through the forests of Wisconsin that I knew as a boy
Past the sky line of Chicago
Round the lakes of Illinois
I lay my head in a motel bed where my back is sore and my eyes turn red
Listen to the trucks roll past my door
Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold
I run just like a river runs, rapid, quick and cold
And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turnpike tolls
And I won't stop 'till I get to New York

'Cause I wanna see my grand-son one last time
Wanna see his eyes sparkling and stare back into mine
Now my time is shorter
I wanna see my daughter
Tell her all the things that I should have taught her

""Oh just be aware,"" she said

Love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark

We wish our weekdays away
Spend our weekends in bed
Drink ourselves stupid
And work ourselves dead
And all just because that's what mom and dad said we should do

We should run through the forests
We should swim in the streams
We should laugh, we should cry
We should love, we should dream
We should stare at the stars and not just the screens
You should hear what I'm saying and know what it means

If we all light up we can scare away the dark

We wish we weren't losers and liars and quitters
We want something more not just nasty and bitter
We want something real not just hashtags and Twitter

It's the meaning of life and it's streamed live on YouTube
But I bet Gangnam Style will still get more views
We're scared of drowning, flying and shooters
But we're all slowly dying in front of fucking computers

And oh think I’m gonna start a fire now

Is cracking and older
With each passing year that goes

I’m yesterdays news

Go dancing under
Go falling free

Past the skyline of Chicago
Round the lakes of Illinois
I lay my head in a motel bed where my back is sore and my eyes turn red
Listen to the trucks roll past my door
Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold
I run just like a river runs, rapid, quick and cold
And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turnpike tolls
And I won't stop 'till I get to New York

'Cause I wanna see my grand-son one last time
Wanna see his eyes sparkling and stare back into mine

I wanna see my daughter

You found love but you, left without it

Seen pyramids and temples made of stone

So much for tonight

Passi,"Quand on déboule, tout se déroule, sur un air de soul.
Voiture lustrée, contact, un son compact.
Les frères coiffés boogie, dégradés, Pento,
Soul-Glow glissant sur tête de négro.
Ce soir funk, zouk, soukouss au Keur Sambo,
3ème merveille dans l'échelle des boîtes afros.
Ah ! l'ALTESSE et BUGSY sont soignés en ""100%"".
Bon sang, les filles sentent bon,
Why'a do bon son, je bois ma boisson.
Laisse-moi tâter la piste de dances ooh ! ça glisse,
Sueur à terre, Big bonda, faux chivés, j'why vais.
Why'a des raclis ""Kao Kao Bougou Bénié"" mal peignées,
Qui te balancent des ""Pchitt"" en début de soirée,
Et des bombes-à-max, avec le string tu vois le Tampax.
Je fais signe au DJ qui met Boombastic,
Le ragga ça donne la trique.
Virginité sautée, see'est pas mon problemo, moi j'dois quène
Toutes les gos.
Refrain :
Dans cette boîte de nuit, tous les négros sont fonce-dé,
Et ne peuvent plus s'arrêter.
Voulez-vous savoir comment j'attaque les rates ?
Miniscule bout de papier, dis rien à ton ke-mé
Gangster d'amour :
See'est un jeune garçon qui te donne une bonne bourre.
Beaucoup ont laissé leur mec pour venir s'animer, à la chasse,
Celui qui lâche sa meuf perd sa place.
Sous les spots, je tape mes pas de pacha.
Dans ma poche why'a mon stylo, sur la ble-ta le whisky-coca.
""Sapa paya"" guette-moi, j'attaque un canon.
Son black bidon, teint en blond, vient me casser les couilles,
Un coup de tête dans sa mère, see'est bon il s'écroule.
De la cocaïne dans sa clope ?
Y... Salope !
Les videurs arrivent, laissez passer on est V.I.P,
Des meufs sur estrade cassent leurs talons carrés.
Elles ont même oublié tous leurs potes recalés,
Elles s'en foutent, t'as raison remue ce que Dieu t'a donné !
Refrain
Je vais errer, langue sortie, séquence collé-serré.
""O Nigivir"", elle là-bas, je l'ai repérée.
Je fais mon chemin entre parfums et seins,
Je bluffe une flambeuse pour qu'on finisse bien.
Aime ton prochain ! Parfait, j'exécute !
Ecoute miss ! Dans culbute, why'a cul et why'a bitte !
Tu sais le mec affalé sur une meuf au fond, see'est moi,
Qui fuit avec elle avant la fin, see'est encore moi !
J'ai vidé le J.B., attaque le vodka-orange,
Alerte au Malibu, mélanges étranges.
Why'a pas de Pamela ! why'a une blondasse classe,
Je lui mets quand même là le billet :
Phénomène pute de luxe,
Chatte épilée, non poilue, comme Pollux.
Je danse à la scar-la, see'est pas la Scala.
- Eh ! DOUBLE S guette !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il why a MY-STO ?
- MAMA mia ! je danse le STOMY-AAH !

Passi,"Les menottes, les notes, la machine à taper
Ton nom, prénom, naissance, nationalité
Poches vidées, ensuite lacets, ceinture, enlevés
Feu d'artifice, c'est l'armistice, le pays est en fête
Pour moi, la fête en garde à vue dans les cages de la police
9 heures-11 heures, parle! Ton nom est sur le tas
J'ai fait 6 pas dans l'enfer des galères, la poisse
Les empreintes, les plaintes, et ce tribunal
Ma famille et mes proches en soutien principal
Pin-Pon-Pin-Pon, les flics s'éclatent, roulent à fond
Bon, mon avocat est clair, mais le juge persévère
Il est vingt heures, mon matricule 49203
J'entre en cellule, D128, la porte claque, mon cœur bat
Mon cousin 49204 me parle de dates, me mate
Enchaîne, soleil, bizness et rates
Le trouble est dans ma tête! Et le maton te guette

Mon corps est enfermé, seule mon âme peut voguer
Barreaux, porte bloquée, ma vie est bloquée
Un œil dans l'oeillet, j'entends le bruit des clés
Les jours se répètent, et le maton te guête
Mon corps est enfermé, seule mon âme peut voguer
Barreaux, porte bloquée, ma vie est bloquée
De derrière l'œillet, je rêve de m'évader
Le trouble est dans ma tête, et le maton te guette
Première nuit, matelas pourri, lits superposés
Carreaux cassés, des rats passent sous mes pieds
Au réveil, j'ai comme la corde au cou, dans cette cage qui fouette
Dans la cour, les corbeaux, les mouettes font la tête
Tous leurs ""croa-croa"" résonnent encore derrière les portes du pénitencier
Dans ma tête: gamelle, parloir, courrier, tourner
Visite médicale: anormal est mon état
Zéro au moral, plus la matinale gaule
Mes dents me font mal, j'ai des boutons dans le dos
Passi fait les 100 pas, parmi les prisonniers
3 mètres de mur, 2 de grillage et 1 de barbelé
8 douches dans le mois, en sueur sans bouger
Soirée télé, couché, soleil d'été, levé
Mon neveu, que je n'ai pas vu naître, au parloir me rend ouf
Dans ces murs, l'odeur des chiottes, du sale, de la bouffe
J'étouffe dans ce goulag, la cellule, le stalag
Les jours se répètent, et le maton te guette

Il suffit d'être au mauvais moment, au mauvais endroit
Et vlan, dans tes dents, tu choisis pas, prends ça
Trahi, ma vie, mon nom salis, comme si j'étais un assassin
C'est comme perdre une partie de poker contre Satan
Dans cette merde en chien, traîté en moins que rien
Certains sortent, puis reviennent de nouveau sous écrou
Dans ma cellule un camé prend un cachet à chaque gamelle
Aux nouvelles? Un suicidé, évacué, menotté, c'est le dawa
Enfin paquetage, libérale pour 49203
Ah, Passi, t'es sorti!
Ah! Ça faisait des mois
J'ai remis du net, ma casquette, et mes blanches baskets
J'erre au vert et j'ai encore moins le goût pour la fête
Autour, toujours nos embrouilles de re-beus et négros
Et le be de bleu, sonne avec le be de barreaux
Je dois signer, dire présent une fois par semaine
Que personne m'engrène:
Je dois pas me faire serrer avant mon jugement
Chez nous, leçon, ne dit jamais: ""Ça y'est, c'est fini
Ça m'arrivera pas, pas à moi, moi, j'pourrai pas béton!""
Donc, à tous les lascars qui ont tourné dans le noir
À toutes les familles qui attendaient au parloir
À tous les concernés par ce genre d'histoire:
Bonne chance, si tu passes devant la barre!
Judas fut le mauvais œil pour l'homme de Nazareth
Toi, n'oublie jamais que le maton nous guette

J'ai pas ta voix, encore moins la vision
Mais la mine de ton crayon, m'offre une brève évasion
Mon corps est détenu, mais mon âme et mon esprit
Peuvent rejoindre l'horizon, dans une brève évasion
Mon corps est enfermé, seule mon âme peut voguer
Porte bloquée, courrier brève évasion
Donc, à tous ceux qui ont galéré, qui galèrent en prison
À tous ceux qui te soutiennent pour pas que tu pètes les plombs
Et le maton te guette
Tout le temps, tant de hargne, tout le temps, tant de larmes
Une pensée aux disparus, une pensée aux enfermés
Bois-d'Arcy, Osny, Fresnes, Fleury, Santé, Nanterre
Les Beaumettes et les autres zonzons
Et le maton te guette

Les coyotes, les jeux de dingues.

Comme à Beyrouth, la déroute,
Un meneur envoûte ses troupes.
Ca s'attroupe, se shoote, se découpe en groupe.

Tragique embrouille,
Une vie s'envole, au sol une mare et une douille.
Vois ! Les tiens pleurer, dis-moi que ça tu peux aimer.
Et toutes ces merdes, qui pourra les arrêter ?
Demain encore ça va se passer, se masser près de chez toi,

La sirène do fourgon et celle do SAMU sonnent,
Comme un spectre ciel, cellule serrent encore des personnes.
En amont le piédestal, en aval ça crève la dalle.
Alors normal, ça se régale de biz dans la morale.
Why'a la peine maximale ou la pierre tombale.
Dans ce monde animal, why'a tant de crotales et de chacals,
On assiste donc aux coups de crocs d'escrocs qui s'escroquent.
Chargé à bloc, tu sors des loques
Et croques si t'en as dans le froc.
Les récits sur conflits, défis, défilent dans les té-ci.
See'est donc ça nos vies ? Goumer pour prouver à qui ?
Oeil pour oeil, lion pour lion, loi do talion dans la bible,
De plombs ça se crible, on est tous chasseurs et cibles.
Dans un conflit, ton arme, ta vie ton 2ème pe-sli.
Dans tes histoires le choix :
Tu fais un tabac, t'abats, ou tu prends une le-ba,
Ou les flics te congèlent, clic-clac ça se bloque là.
Tout ça parce que doit couler le sang de la vandetta.

J'entends des ""j'm'en fous, je lui nique sa mère,
Son père, attends, tu vas voir...""
Gros plan, action ! Allons-why, ça va le faire,
Là je suis ton ennemi en noir, bonnet noir, lunettes noires,
Capuche noire, le cerbère dans ton cauchemar.
Chiré dans la foule, comme la houle je déboule,
Les sentiments je refoule, ne tremble pas mais roucoule,
Je sens déjà le sang qui coule et te vois qui t'écroules;
Les secondes roulent, dans ma tête le film se déroule.
Dans l'épilogue, tu tâtes l'autre univers,
Ta vie est en offrande, moi je suis le missionnaire.
Je sais plus trop pourquoi mais ""Paye tes dettes mon frère !""
Deux coups dans le dos en guise d'embarcadère.

Car de rien, je voulais peser par mes propres moyens.
Graver mes initiales en large dans le futur,
Jour après jour, plus parano j'accélérais l'allure.
See'est re-lou ! Dans ma vie, je suis devenu encore plus che-lou,
Plus je gravis, je pèse, plus j'ai des histoires de fou.
Le soir, je fais de nouveaux rêves, à vrai dire des cauchemars :
Au-dessus de ma tête toujours ce putain de corbeau noir.
Dans la foule en furie, le film défile au ralenti,
La faucheuse passe, la poisse, mon corps se glace.
Ca se passe en soirée : ""PASSI, prends ça ! Enculé !""

Ah ! Vraiment tes descendants ont les mêmes traits que toi.
Je suis plus vieux, je comprends mieux, avant je n'écoutais pas.

J'lance la Roue de la fortune, j'ai ma Chance dans la Chanson

Bonjour Docteur,
Ouais j’ai créé mon parallèle univers, c’était inconscient et profond
Mais aujourd’hui j’ai besoin d’aide
J’ai pas d’hallucination, ni de fantôme ou de bonhomme vert
Mais j’ai vu, lu entre les lignes, depuis mon esprit erre
Perturbé, j’ai vu l’homme trahir et tuer tel animal
J’ai vu le rouge, le noir, j’ai eu la dalle, j’ai lu Stendhal
J’ai vu un pretre pédophile, un politico fils d’immigré facho
Au bois de Boulogne, des lascars au boulot et des keufs macros
Où est le vrai ? Mec ? Felé tel Houellebecq
Je me pose des questions
Et j’ai trop d’amis qui auraient besoin d’une bonne consultation
Entre raison et prime, entre le cerveau et le string
C’est pas clair dans ma tete, c’est le combat, c’est Clearstream
J’ai meme vu un de mes potes comme mon brolique se retourner contre moi
Tombé sous une embrouille, j’ai dû courir, sinon je ne serais pas là
Croire en qui ou en quoi ? Voilà la question que je me pose
Doc, je crois en moi, mais c’est l’équinoxe dans mon cerveau, trop d’ecchymoses

C’est confidentiel, c’est entre toi et moi, c’est existentiel, ca mon psy m’la dit
Pense à ta vie, au pourquoi, ferme les yeux, réfléchis, déballe c’est normal, ca mon psy m’l’a dit

J’ai dû voir un truc que je n’aurais pas dû voir
Mon cœur a saigné, autour, j’ai un mur pour arreter l’hémorragie
J’ai dû boire un élixir que je n’aurais pas dû boire
Abandonné entre le bien, le mal, cause de ma folie
Mensonge, méfiance, tristesse ont envahi ma vie
On veut paraitre beau, fort, quitte à vivre dans l’interdit
Faut cuver, comprendre cette amertume, m’a dit mon psy
Recherche la vérité, l’amour, comprendre ses envies

J’ai été coureur de jupons car le sexe est bon
Puis tu t’en fous, t’attaques, tu les fuis, puis ca mort à l’hamecon
Je ne suis pas misogyne mais j’ai croisé cette féministe
Ni pute ni soumise, dans une boite échangiste
Entre Oedipe et contes de fesses, dans une époque vulgaire
On est paumé, et trop de femmes aujourd’hui n’arrangent pas l’affaire
L’air angélique, belle figure, et l’âme de Belphégor
J’ai vu trop aimer trop de trucs gores, mon esprit s’égare encore

C’est confidentiel, c’est entre toi et moi, c’est existentiel, ca mon psy m’la dit
Pense à ta vie, au pourquoi, ferme les yeux, réfléchis, déballe c’est normal, ca mon psy m’l’a dit

Pas de beau-père, de belle-mère, ni d’histoire d’abus pervers
Je me perds dans tous ces blèmes qu’il faut qu’un jour je perce
Une bonne éducation, mais j’ai peut-etre trop vite perdu mon père
En parler à Dieu le père ? Dans quelle langue et quelle prière ?
Est-ce ce monde qui ne tourne pas rond, ou moi qui pète les plombs
Docteur, répondez-moi, c’est juste une question de fond
Est-ce normal ces folies partielles, névroses passagères
Ce manque de repères et cette tendance suicidaire
J’ai un côté clean, un côté classe
Un raisonnable, un côté con, un côté fort, un côté fou
Un côté bling, un côté bang, un côté ying, un yang
Un côté swing, un sombre, un insolent côté gang
Un côté king, un côté kong, fougueux, irrespectueux, situation psychotique
J’ai pensé braquer la banque, ou le fric de la Brink’s
Je briserais bien cette bitch ou ce raciste politique
Allô Docteur, c’est la noiraude, est-ce donc si critique ?

J'ai chanté les Hommes, leurs désirs 
Les destins fragiles et l'amour (je suis né dans la rue)
On a voulu que j' tombe sur place 
Moi, j'ai souvent fait face et je combats toujours (le combat continue)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Dis l'heure de Hip Hop Rock 
Des burnes dans le froc 
Fusion guitares et pe-ra pour civils et colboques 
Ministère, Johnny 
Aussi burnés qu'un keuf sous Sarkozy 
Liberté dans ma musique et l'savoir comme Uzi 
Baskets blanches et blousons noirs, génération, manque d'espoir 
Exempté de conneries, que ce gardien me foute la paix 
Lascars abandonnés, j'ai le rêve des cités dortoirs 
Mon rap tout-terrain, mon R.T.T, c'est ça qui est la vérité 

L'être humain porte en lui le meilleur (ouais) 
Je sens encore le poids de mes erreurs, de mes erreurs (ouais)
Le pire a si souvent été là 
La peine guidait mes pas mais je la garde au fond de moi (jusqu'au dernier souffle)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Non, rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (Ministère A.M.E.R, Johnny Hallyday)

Hither by Thy help I come
Oh, and I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Wondering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

So to grace, how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
And let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
