The Orchestra,"Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Stardust gleamin' 
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion, 
You're a blue illusion 
While I'm in this Azure interlude.
I'm not wanted I'm so all alone;
Always haunted
By the dreams I own;
But, though Im tormented
I must be contented 
Driftin' Dreamin' 
In an Azure mood!

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Might have gone but what for?

Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away,
And if you hear a song today.
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
 
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low,
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe;
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travlin' alone down that last long mile

With all their trouble and woes
They're cryin' 'cause they all loved

And that ain't good

Not made of wood

The Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1962
The Orchestra,"Anyone can whistle, that's what they say, easy
Anyone can whistle any old day, easy
It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why can't I

I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why, why can't I
I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

One night together might be nice

The Orchestra,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room

To live again, to love again

When day is done
And night comes on
Until the dawn
What do I do
I clasp your hand
And wander through slumberland
Dream-dancing with you

We dance between
A sky serene
And fields of green
Sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime
Whenever I spend my time
Dream-dancing with you

Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touchung you, clutching you
All the night through
So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career

To paradise prancing

The Orchestra,"Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered weak and weary
From a long trip on the Erie
Comes a rappin' on my chamber door

It's an ectoplasmic tapping
That disturbs my nightly napping
Like a shroud that's gently flapping
Emanating from the second floor

Buddies are we, me and the ghost upstairs
Sipping our tea, me and the ghost upstairs
But he's inclined to moan when left alone
So I think of things that'll tickle his funny bone

Lonely old ghost upstairs

Regular folks, droppin' our worldly cares
Swappin' our jokes, me and the ghost upstairs
And then he slaps his shroud and laughs out loud
And says ""Oh boy, that'll paralyze all the crowd""

Jolly old ghost upstairs

He's quite a cook, he serves a beautiful drink
He wrote a book and in invisible ink
I took a look and the title 'pon the page
Was 'The Groups of Wraith'

Once in a while he brings a gang of friends
Does it in style, careless of what he spends
And though the place is small we have a ball
'Cause you know those spooks don't require no room at all

We have some mighty fine affairs
Me and the ghost upstairs
We have some mighty fine affairs

Played on the mandolin
But he couldn't win
Cause he tried to swing
And he broke a string every time

Poor Mr. Chisholm
Just couldn't dig the jive
When he did arrive at the proper note
He arrived by boat every time

He tried to jazz up his mandolin
But never could quite control it
He always brought Bach and Handel in
When it took a lick, he always broke a pick

Poor Mr. Chisholm
You're quite a gay old blade
With your serenade, but you're corny, Jack
Better truck on back to Dubuque

You disgrace your kin

The Orchestra,"I so often dream
We might make a team
But so wild a scheme
I must banish

And our time beguile
Going native
But how can we go
Unless you are co-
Operative

My dear, I've a feeling you are
So near and yet so far
You appear like a radiant star
First so near, then again so far

I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far

The Orchestra,"(Narrator)
Some folks dream of the wonders they'll do
Before their time on this planet is through
Some just don't have anything planned
They hide their hopes and their heads in the sand
Now I don't say who is wrong, who is right
But if by chance you are here for the night
Then all I need is an hour or two
To tell the tale of a dreamer like you

We all dream a lot-- some are lucky, some are not
But if you think it, want it, dream it, then it's real
You are what you feel

But all that I say can be told another way
In the story of a boy whose dream came true
And he could be you",Prologue [Final],1994
The Orchestra,"I went walking down by the river
Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried

He told me he was very lonesome
And no one cared if he lived or died
And said sometimes the thunder and lightning
Make all little clouds hide

He said ""Have faith in all kinds of weather""
""For the sun will always shine""
""Do your best and always remember""
""The dark clouds pass with time""

He asked if I'd tell all my world

In nimble feet?

That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed,

Ou alors seulement 
Parfois du bout des yeux,
Même riches ils sont pauvres, 
Ils n'ont plus d'illusions, 
Et n'ont qu'un cœur pour deux.
Chez eux ça sent le thym, 
Le propre, la lavande, 
Et le verbe d'antan,
Que l'on vive à Paris, 
On vit tous en province 
Quand on vit trop longtemps.
Est-ce d'avoir trop ri 
Que leur voix se lézarde 
Quand ils parlent d'hier?
Et d'avoir trop pleuré 
Que des larmes encore 
Leur perlent les paupières?
Et s'ils tremblent un peu 
Est-ce de voir vieillir 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui dit ""Je vous attends"".

Les vieux ne rêvent plus, 
Leurs livres s'ensommeillent, 
Leurs pianos sont fermés,
Le petit chat est mort. 
Le muscat du dimanche 
Ne les fait plus chanter,
Les vieux ne bougent plus, 
Leurs gestes ont trop de rides, 
Leur monde est trop petit,
Du lit à la fenêtre, 
Puis du lit au fauteuil, 
Et puis du lit au lit,
Et s'ils sortent encore 
Bras dessus, bras dessous, 
Tout habillés de raide,
C'est pour suivre au soleil 
L'enterrement d'un plus vieux, 
L'enterrement d'une plus laide,
Et le temps d'un sanglot 
Oublier toute une heure 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui les attend.

Les vieux ne meurent pas, 
Ils s'endorment un jour 
Et dorment trop longtemps,
Ils se tiennent la main, 
Ils ont peur de se perdre, 
Et se perdent pourtant
Et l'autre reste là, 
Le meilleur ou le pire, 
Le doux ou le sévère,
Cela n'importe pas, 
Celui des deux qui reste 
Se retrouve en enfer.
Vous le verrez peut-être, 
Vous le verrez parfois 
En pluie et en chagrin
Traverser le présent. 
En s'excusant déjà 
De n'être pas plus loin.
Et fuir devant vous 
Une dernière fois 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui leur dit ""Je t'attends"",
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui nous attend",Les Vieux,1996

Même si on m'appelle Dieu le Père
Celui qui est dans l'annuaire
Entre ""Dieulefit"" et ""Dieu vous garde""

Même si toujours trop bonne pomme
Je m'crève le cœur et l'pur esprit
A vouloir consoler les hommes
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit
J'entendrai dans mon paradis
Les anges, les Saints et Lucifer

The Orchestra,"Bien sûr, nous eûmes des orages
Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol

Dans cette chambre sans berceau
Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

Mais mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements
Tu m'as gardé de piège en piège
Je t'ai perdue de temps en temps
Bien sûr tu pris quelques amants
Il fallait bien passer le temps
Il faut bien que le corps exulte
Mais finalement, finalement
Il nous fallut bien du talent
Pour être vieux sans être adultes

Mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Et plus le temps nous fait cortège
Et plus le temps nous fait tourment
Mais n'est-ce pas le pire piège
Que vivre en paix pour des amants
Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt
Je me déchire un peu plus tard
Nous protégeons moins nos mystères
On laisse moins faire le hasard
On se méfie du fil de l'eau
Mais c'est toujours la tendre guerre

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Why keep nursing the blues?

Shall we dance or walk on air?

You better dance little lady

If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together

The Orchestra,"The sound that you're listenin' to
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame

I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright",Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,2001

And misery was all I knew
Trying so to keep my love from showing
All the while not knowing you loved me too

Yes, loved me in lonesome silence
Your heart filled with dark despair
Thinking love would flame in you forever
And I'd never, never know the flame was there

Then one day we cast away our secret longing
The raging tide we held inside would hold no more
The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken

And now there's twice as much grief
Twice the strain for us
Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us
As we had known before

The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken
And after all had been said here we are, my love
Silent once more and not far, my love
From where we were before

Can mean to a tired heart
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray
And the dear friends have to part?

Well this is the end of a perfect day,
Near the end of a journey too.
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong,
With a wish that is kind and true.

When my voice hits the air

Out in the moonlight
I came to serenade

I sang her to sleep with ""Asleep in the Deep""

I could keep right on
Because you're so light on
Your feet
You're easy to dance with

There is no doubt in
The way we stand out in
The crowd
Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing
Out loud
You're easy to dance with

Loving you
The way I do
Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat
All those charms
In one man's arms
Makes you easy to dance with
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet

The Orchestra,"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly 

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, chin, chin, chin
When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

It's so nice to close your lips with mine.","Yah-Ta-Ta, Yah-Ta-Ta (Talk, Talk, Talk)",2003

I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir

The Orchestra,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Act 1. Overture,2005

Might never be mean
Might never be cross,

You loutish lads look not for love,
You grab your loins and hunt for blood,
You unleash the tension,
Do things i wouldn't mention

Your weekday demons take their toll on you,
But your weekend revolution just won't do,
Don't hang yourself with your christmas tie,
In your coffin flat, 
You sit and die,
Your weekend revolution",Weekend Revolution,2004
The Ordinary Boys,"You barged into this a lie 
And now you're far too deep to, stop
When your eyes were full of fire 
And you didn't feel tense 

When you lie to one another 
It's that there's nothing left to say, 
The words 'I Love You' fill awkward silences 

And life just cannot, stop
If you've gone and messed it, up
And I won't be here, no I won't comfort you 
So get your act together 

Your matrimonial fulfillment started life as harmless lies, 
Thanks to bodily requirements 
You are walking blind 

And life just cannot, stop
If you've gone and messed it up 
And I won't be here, no I won't comfort you 
Oh get your act together 

And life just cannot
And life just cannot
And life just cannot

The Ordinary Boys,"I've had nights I will never forget
I've had nights I will always regret
But I can take it on the chin and say...
Boys will be boys
There's been girls that have stolen our hearts
But their arms simply couldn't be prized apart
They will never let us in and say
Boys will be boys

Well it's under my skin so I could never win, oh thanks a lot
We cheat and we lie and we fight, we don't cry but we try
Ha!

I felt driven and I felt obliged
I've had feeling like thorn in my side
I hope you never let us down now
Boys will be boys

Blinded by sorrow I could hardly restrain
Everywhere there's guilt laboured with pain
Chin up, chin up now
Boys will be boys

(Ranking Junior)
Ah you said, you better move out the way
I come to keep the people rocking and sway
I'm well serious, I'll never ever play
Boys will be boys, and there's nothing you can say (way)

Spread the word I'll cross the land
Must make people understand
Wish I had a magic wand
To connect people united as one

this goes out to all the girls
On the mic might send you round the bend
Boys will be boys, listen right to the end!

Well it's under my skin so I could never win, oh thanks a lot

Too brassbound to talk about it
Cause you don't care

And I'll unload my soul, my fear is tright and true
You hang on words I only wish I knew
