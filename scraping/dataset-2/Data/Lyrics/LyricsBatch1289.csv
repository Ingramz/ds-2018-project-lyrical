Its going down baby (in the city in the city)x4 its going down
In the motha fuckin' city 

[Chorus]
You got a one way ticket to hell,
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL,
And aww, I don't want to hustle no more but the streets won't let me go,
All my niggaz say,
Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5 and 6, but that's it.

For a nigga with a dream,
Atlanta is the city,
And they make it so seem,
But ride through the city,
And The Streets ain't clean,
All I see is drug deals, big wheels and feinds,
But any way they took East Atlanta back,(?)
Throw Atlanta Down,
Turned little Vietnam to a white folks town,
And fo, I forget to say you should have been fixture streets by MLK,
I ain't talkin' about the dope,
In talking about the raggedy road,
Niggas crack they rims riding over potholes,
But that's how it goes,
When you stuck fuck outta luck and lost in the ghetto's.

[Chorus]
You got a one way ticket to hell,
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL,
And aww, I don't want to hustle no more but the streets won't let me go,
All my niggaz say,
Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5 and 6, but that's it.

They talking ATL, Atlanta Georgia,
We the shit,
We talking Holy Feild you know that nigga named Michael Vick
They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy,
They talking jet skiis, I had that shit last summer boy,
Charles is gone, Cher is show case,
5 5 9 night life (they had it goin on),
Back then Shawty D was gone,
Flat heat right here was on,
They put me on the song back then we all got along, ain't had no switch game
Atlanta just won't be the same,
Hit Man, Sammy Sam, DJ Smurf and Ying Yang,
I know when kids rockin(?) used to beat the block, I lived in a little house boy,
And the block party would never stop, I remember when G-Lyfe was when I had that little jelly bean,
I remember them East 30 Cadillacs and
Cut Supreme,(?) I built the school and shot Marvin that's what I did,
I remember the curfews what we used to get(?).

[Chorus]

A parking lot Alley niggaz thinkin' again,
When you speaking bout' Atlanta mention Ying Yang Twins,
There born and raised,
God done made it hard for us,
'Cause y'all outta towners came here and fucked shit up, 
But y'all can't fuck with us, cause as soon as shit start goin on you leave Atlanta and go right back home,
And that's the pussy mother fucker,
Ya heard me motherfucker, bring off in there mouth (?) ATL-ANTA,
Stop asking me cause that why I stay, if you can spell,
That's Atlant motherfucker, ya heard me mother fucker,
So don't ask me again,
'Cause I ain't saying it again,
Let me ask you do you remember jelly bean Cherri Show Case Club sense in tha game,
Lemme tell you about some ghettos,
Inglewood East Lameadows(?) ATL.

Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'

[Chorus: x 2]
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (should have known)
Should have left that bitch alone
Now I'm stuck with naggin'

[Verse 1]
This is for then niggaz who be fuckin' with them feelings
And you get your heart caught up in the mix
Cause your love fucks what's up her dress, and never paid attention
Cause you didn't think the girl would start tripping
Shawty flip the scripted
Start saying all type of shit out of her lips
And let me tell you what I can't stand
When a women play the role of a man
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
Treat me like a sped, like he lack to understand
I know you know I ain't gone go for the short jacking all the time
Talking to me out of line broad, truly you done lost your mind
You gone fuck round and get my some time
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired of listening to your naggin

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A lil' more grip a lil' less lip
Before I pack my bag on you ass and dip
And a point of no return and you made it that way
Buy the shit that you say every motherfuckin' day
Hope you paying attention cause I got to mention
Dissin' me in front of your friends
Trying to get a lil' laugh in your crack in
Then I want to whoop his ass then
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
Used to them fake ass men
Really ain't no man but you like how he pretend
I'm going to keeping sipping my Hen and smoking my herbs
And I'm going to need a lot of grill cause of your nagging girl
The way you talking absurd, gettin' on my nerves
All in my ear about to make me hit the curve
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired of listening to your naggin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One day I got shot by Cupid
This was when this relationship went stupid
We was talking on the phone too long
Now her ass isn't home
Tellin' me you out with your friends
Find out later on you with your other men
You ain't nothing but a dividend
Say you suck and fuck but you ain't gettin nothin
That's a damn shame it ended like this
And I ain't got love for you bitch
Shoo fly don' bother me
Will I get back with her probably
Then I thought about it I won't
Do I really want you I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'm going to leave her alone
'Cause I can do bad on my own, that's why she gone
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired listenin' to your naggin'

You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know

Gold diggers flag me down, trying to get me to stop

But oh no, a nigga recognized disguise
I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head

Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed

But your misses get nothing, but diss and mugs

I don't give dick to chicks, that give it up to scrubs
Trying to find the finest bitch, up in the club
Make her up that thing, get in her ear
And fill her up, with game

Ten times out of ten, I'ma cut that thang
Got the broad giving up the brain, like it ain't nothing mayn
I'm a P-I-M-P, simple to me
And talk hoes out they clothes, so easily

Should have left that bitch alone

This is for then niggaz who be fuckin with them feelings
And you get your heart caught up in the mix
Cause your love fucks what's up her dress, and never paid attention
Cause you didn't think the girl would start tripping
Shawty flip the scripted
Start saying all type of shit out of her lips
And let me tell you what I can't stand
When a women play the role of a man
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
Treat me like a sped, like he lack to understand
I know you know I ain't gone go for the short jacking all the time
Talking to me out of line broad, truly you done lost your mind
You gone fuck round and get my some time

Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass

A lil more grip a lil less lip
Before I pack my bag on you ass and dip
And a point of no return and you made it that way
Buy the shit that you say every motherfuckin day
Hope you paying attention cause I got to mention
Dissin me in front of your friends
Trying to get a lil laugh in your crack in
Then I want to woop his ass then
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
Used to them fake ass men
Really ain't no man but you like how he pretend
I'm going to keeping sipping my Hen and smoking my herbs
And I'm going to need a lot of grill cause of your nagging girl
The way you talking absurd, gettin on my nerves
All in my ear about to make me hit the curve

One day I got shot by Cupid
This was when this relationship went stupid
We was talking on the phone too long
Now her ass isn't home
Tellin me you out with your friends
Find out later on you with your other men
You ain't nothing but a dividend
Say you suck and fuck but you ain't gettin nothin
That's a damn shame it ended like this
And I ain't got love for you bitch
Shoo fly don' bother me
Will I get back with her probably
Then I thought about it I won't
Do I really want you I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'm going to leave her alone
Cause I can do bad on my own, that's why she gone
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad

On the streets I'm a legend, in my hood I'm a star

Created in my back pocket
Ya ever know when it might rain
Streets are gettin' it
You know the streets, they made it mayne

I ain't asked it for nothin', 'cause it don't owe me shit
It taught me the game and told me, ""Go, get rich""
Twenty pounds in a rental car, headed to the Mack Town
T-why told me, ""Get the work and make it touch down""

I did that, made that, now I'm on my way
Just my luck, they know it's the Texas license plate
Now I got a problem, 'cause them undercover's onto me
It's time to bail, 'cause a snitch I will never be

I swear I'm like a fish
Greetin' land with a kiss
Did I hit or did I miss?
Well, it goes like this

The hood made me what I am today, my nigga
The hood raisin' up the beat is weight, my nigga
First it showed me the game and then it showed me the money
Designed the code that I live by and told me to run it

So I start with the shit plus I was born with the knowledge
A young wise muhfucka get respect like a prophet
Who can take the game plan, design a ride
And trust what's in my hand and not what's comin' out they mouth?

I'm a down low nigga so I stay on the ground
I push mills, push guns, push coke, push pounds
I got a nine-to-five, so make it look good
Kobe, A.K.A. skinny to pusha in the hood

My brother went to jail and left me alone
Found out I had another brother, pa was a rollin' stone
My brotha, Eddie Banks taught me the street
My cousin Jewelz showed me how to rip up the keys

My other brotha Hut taught me to do it big
Connected to 3, you get a black hustlin' jeep
Connected to gang shit, I got the game sick
Money, power, respect, that shit didn't come quick

On the streets I'm a legend, in my hood I'm a star

I came up when Ice Cube was a young nigga
B.E. was rebellin' in the city with one high school
But now I'm a legend
I done opened up for Chris Love and Love and Ludacris, y'all
Seen niggas careers begin, rise and fall

What's happenin' y'all? Well, shit I ain't got no one to call
Like when yo ass didn't get no respect if you were in New York
I'm the nigga to call when in trouble, Lil red clay warrior
Got any nigga pick up the mic and I'm straight destroyin' ya

Grip Town Georgia, bitch, we awful scared
Came up when you didn't get no love if you ain't in ATL
I'm the nigga in my city when I'm chillin' on the porch

Before we used to walk
Before we had life in the dry
And 911 wasn't known outside
We didn't know how to read
We didn't know how to write
All we did was sing all day and all night
Then when they let us start learning
You all lose y'all mind
And y'all forgot about the earlier times
When Martin Luther King had a dream
That one day we'd walk together
We really need to get it together

Learn all you can
Graduate, go to college, get knowledge
Then we shall overcome, yes we can, we
In the urge of faith we can demand it, for real

Its a wonder they don't come home in they suit
I took away some time
Thinkin' how i could, should, would be
If everybody in the world was free
No crime nobody doing wrong
Everybody getting along
But when i step into reality
This world is sore
And that's why we at war
Killin' ourselves over bullshit
That we valued more than life

Always talking shit
They wanna be the shit
But is they shit? No
And hoes, they fuck off the god damn chain
Everything and everything but don't take names
So that's a nasty hoe and I can't do shit wit it
Please get out my face I don't need a case
Yeah, I love you all respectful women

I takes 'em out all the time
But you all hit the baggage need to keep on tracking
I ain't speaking I ain't talking to nothing

I know what you go through
From me to you, I love you

[Verse 1: D-Roc]
From the nigga to the baller, never satisfied
So the money got you doing shit that'll fuck up your pride
You ain't a hoe, you just really trying to get by
Every day looking up at the sky
Sometimes, shit get so hard
It really have you bothered
First you sigh, then you cry
Up a whole puddle of water
Seem like this shit won't ever end
Merry go rounds to the whirlwinds
Waves turn to a hurricane
If you see joy, you got to see pain
Shit in the world ain't gonna ever change
Even when you die, it'll be the same
Now you due to them circumstances
Jars aren't counted so your forced to dance
Hoping and praying for a second chance
Just wanna put back on your pants
Walk out the club and throw up your hands
Tired of being disrespected by her man
Think this shit ain't right for you
Niggaz been yellin all night for you
Got in your mind what's best for you
Walk up to the club to tell them your through

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
She's stuck off in this little room
With nothing left to hold onto
Her life is in a little box
She's wondering will it ever stop?
The life of a stripper

[Hook: Girl]
I'm so sick and I'm so tired
Of these clubs, I keep crying
Every night, I wipe my eyes
Cause these years pass me by
I give up, I'm all in
My whole life is full of sin
This road is a dead end
I wanna live again

[D-Roc]
From the part where a child is torn from a mothers umbilical cord
No one really enforces that lifes gonna be hard
Which is kinda left up to the teachers
And the teachers leave it up to the preachers
the preachers ain't fillin' up the bleachers
It's the rappers
Sad, ain't it

[Verse 2: Kane]
It was this girl named Star, pretty fine little woman
Going to college, taking off her clothes for money
She gotta pay the rent, she got a little girl
Her baby daddy ain't shit, See what she dealin with?
But she gotta hold on (hold on)
Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)
She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime
She like ""fuck how she feel"" living is real
So she back in the club again
Taking off her clothes again
Going to school, going to work, getting tiring
Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat
and these shoes on her feet
She got a test next week so she stressed
Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction
Her parents died when she was eight years old
And after that, she felt like she was all alone
But she got her grandparents and they raised her well
Keep going to school, take care of yourself
Getting hard, going to school and work in the club
And at the same time looking for love
She can't keep skipping for an occupation
In a minute, she'll be graduating
Make her wanna throw up her hands
Now she only wanna live again

Ying Yang Twins,"Girl, Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time 
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time) 
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind 
(Well oh oh..) 

Up in the street and misguided never payed attention 
So I got my soul devine, player's soul decided 
to let my soul confide with the lights of him 
Who the father, my bread and my water 
I never bought a cue and into this (?) 
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrites 
It'll take your life to be a Christian man 
I hope you learn, everything else 
Is in vein so you're bound to burn 
Gonna break your bone 
I'm in a war don't let this life game over-rule 
Trying take control of you 
That's all the devil do 
God was in Jesus, God is in us 
But God ain't in the barrel of that pistol that you bust 
You can play this game wrong, you gotta take it how it goes, 
Is there ever a feeling for living if the body's gone 
I never understood why what can make a man cry, 
It can make a man strong when nobody's on his side 

Girl, (girl) Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time 
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time) 
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind 
(Never crossed my mind, never crossed my mind, oooh) 
(Well oh oh..) 

Back and forth, night and day, you repeat the same scene 
Standing at the pool a bit, time to repent again 
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose 
When the poo of the world, got me standin by the circle 
Agitate you, yes it does, this is what you though was love 
Only name, same to be lust, mixed emotions make you want to bust 
Mamma tryin, children cryin, dad outta work, welfare lying 
Prejudice, always see, the bottom of the barrel 
Falling down on my knees, heavenly father, here we go on knowing 
That we get to heaven, there's gonna be some open arms, 
Judgment was man-made, not a [..], and this I recorded, 
But I didn't live the party, but I thank that my heart beat, 
Gotta make me, oh sure Jesus I don't know if there's a hell, 
But I know I've whitnessed hell here, all I do is dwell here 
Trying not to trail here, saying too much will get you knocked off or locked up in jail here 
Tell me do you smell fear, knowing that we so near, 
Trying to take the voices of the truth, out the youth ear, 
And if you late a time frame, you play all kind of mind games, 
I ain't put my life on the line for a damn thing 

Girl, Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time 
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time) 
And Girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind 
(Never crossed my mind) 
(Well oh oh..) 

I can never make it, I can never ever make it 
Without you baby 
Cause you've been my best friend 
Girl, 
When everybody turned their back on me, 
You were there when I fell down on my knees 
And I give you all, all of me, 
And every part of me, oooowoooo, 

Girl, me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time 
(For long time, such a mighty long time) 
And girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin you has never crossed my mind

I'm a live, I will never leave o no no 
When the people say, c'mon and go with me 
'Cause I will never leave you, and you've been my best friend

From off the block hustlin' to rockin' shows

Never worry , about them haters, that will never change

But at a drop of a dime I'll be there for ya, 
And anybody want to see us apart we need to get rid of
They ass man and that's from the heart. 
Pick em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends, 
We seem to have plenty of friends. excuse me then friend,
Let me borrow a stack and when tomorrow comes don't ask me to borrow it back. 
If they can't do that they don't contribute to the answer ? from the ?
Serious as cancer. If I was jojo dancer I would do the same thang, 
Not to let another man spark my flame. D-roc is the ying, 
Kain is the yang but without
The both of us we ain't got a damn thang.

And my brother we done been through a lot but still kain I love ya. 
Blood, sweat, and tears, good days and bad from
The time you make me laugh you made me mad. 
I still got cha back but imma take ya way back 
When we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack, scraping up
Change trying to make 2 dollars or 3 to get 
Some 99 cent hamburgers to eat 
And then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car. 
Back then we was some
Underground superstars and these last 5 years we done put work in, 
Now the whole world know of the ying yang twins. 
Even though we don't spend time at home
Together, we hit the road and its like we never left each other. 
Now that's love,
I love you til the day that I leave so its still my brother and me.

People of the world we must change our mind frame 
And stay away from the con and mind games. 
Its hard to maintain and stay sane at the same time, steady
Working hard but you bareky gettin by trying 
To make a line between stress and peace 
And satan always gettin the best of me, 
My closest of kin, my best
Friend, man we all in the struggle 
But you gotta remember I'm yo brother. 
Listen people you need to start helping yo brother, 
Helping yo sister, mama, daddy, children and all. 
Don't leave these babies out here all alone they
Don't know what's going on. THey don't know right from wrong, 
So when you see yo brother give him a hug 
And a shoulder to lean on and don't leave him out here
On his own cause times gettin hard these days.

Good evening ladies welcome to Sex Therapy 101.
I am your doctor Chris Olmen here.
And we are gonna do the 3 basic elements of sexual gratification today.
And what were talkin about is 3 simple questions, and I'm gonna post question #1 right now.

[Girl #1]
I like for a man to step up to me with swagger.
Know what you want and take control with me, fuck the dumb shit.
He's a nigga that knows what he doing.
Cause I ain't trying to teach no nigga.

Ladies I'm just so impressed with you guys today.
Progress is really being made.
Now we getting ready to switch gears on the third question and this is:
What gets you in the mood, for sex?

[Girl # 2]
It's all about the 4-play 
and 4-play is an all day event
phone sex, e-mails whatever
just some shit to make me want you that much more when I get home from work and step in the door lights out
candles burnin' wit some Jodeci: Diary of a Mad Band 
rub me down all the way down
tease me, bite me, suck me

[Girl # 1]
I'm like a motor in the winter
you gotta get me warmed up before you get me started
tongue touching, body rubbing 
and when we take it there,
Don't be afriad to taste both these lips

[Girl # 3]
Now I can't speak for them young girls but uh 
we can do it anywhere: 
in the car, on the lawn before dawn
under the moon, at the beach 
as long as it's sweet lil candlelight something soft and sexy

And kaine really don't like discursion 
See pain is kinda what I like dispursin

Dead, pulled by a van, blood gone from his head
I had another partner named Terry
Dead, he tried to flee the scene before they hit 'em wit the left

My grandma always said
When it rains it pours
So they're dying like flies
Got me kinda scared to go outdoors

I had a cousin named Ant
Dead, they say the young man only died by the head
The streets all we got it
Boys gon' be boys, me in ya hype
Teach your son to like guns with toys

Now what we supposed to do
When you know you gotta get ya kid enrolled in school?
So you start hanging 'round with the local crew

Have a smoke or two
Start kicking 'em a joke or two
Tell me what the parent's supposed to do?

Go tell momma

1979 that's when my momma had me
2006, her oldest son is a daddy
Check it, I got two daughters of my own
They say I degrade women
But they degrade they self

They didn't have help, growing up
She had a dead beat momma
And a dead beat dad

She go and shake, shakes quick in the club
Drop it like it's hot
I tell my kids what to do
And what to do not

I'm a grown and
I gotta feed my kids
So I teach them the right
And wrong way to live

If you feel bad
You need to stop shaking, shaking
And your parents won't be so mad
Might smile at you

If you keep shaking your *** in the club
Ying Yang gon' show you love
Listen, I keep stressing to my daughters stay in school
Learn all you can, yes, I'm a real family man

23 hour lockdown
Where they treat you like a ho
Slide you a plate up under the door
Nigga have to shit in the middle of the floor
Prison ain't a place that we need to go
So 'til they free Pimp see
I'ma leave up to you G O K K K
To keep it street
This one here for the street

Life can be so hard
Shit can hurt so bad
Always have you sayin'
Constantly making you mad (Say Free Pimp see Free Pimp see!)
Life can be so hard (Free Pimp see Free Pimp see!)

Always have you sayin (Free Pimp see Free Pimp see!)

In a lil bitty room where there ain't no light
Thinkin bout this is the wrong and the right
The dark and the light, the strong and the weak
Your conscious askin you trying to get you sanity
You gotta hold your ground
Can let it ??? Your friends in the heatership
While they always dip
Left you by yourself stuck up fucked up
Behind them bars, the times is hard
Thought you was smart
Now you losing
Jumping around the room giving yourself febreezy
Trying all types of suicidal tactics
The people walk in and put you in strait jacket
Until they free Pimp see
I'ma leave it up to you G O K K K

Got Bun be to bounce wit us on this beat

23 hours lockdown in a cell
Can drive a nigga crazy as hell
Looking at four walls

Can do nothing at all
Got you feeling like a dog in a cage
A monkey on the rage
And the guard I wanna spit in your face
Take the privilege away
But keep your head up son be brave
Don't let the worries of jail bring you down keep a focus head
And gain more knowledge instead
I know it's not where you wanna be
But take it from me I know everybody love to be free
So god dammit free Pimp see
I know he ready to hit the street
And jumb back to makin beats
And I know that nigga miss Bun be
So we gon keep it on the G
That's comin for my brother and me
And we gon be here when you hit the streets
We waiting on the date that they free Pimp see

[Bun B]
D-Roc let me put something on your brain
How would you feel if they locked up Kane?
Kane how would you feel if they locked up D?
Well that's what the fuck happened to me
With Pimp see, my right hand
My best friend
My ace boom coom, man we closer than ken
We've been on the grind, holdin it down
Till he got caught up in some bullshit, that got him some time
Almost lost my mind, started drinkin a fifth a day
Couldn't understand why they was takin a pimp away (Why?)
We right on the edge, we bout to blow
?? Need to go
Sittin in the cell watchin time go pass
Lookin at your kids and your momma through a glass
If I could turn back time I would of told him keep the glock down
But now I pray for the day he may get out 23 hour lock down

To die on salty afternoons and dissipate with all the fumes

Es que realmente me has convertido en la otra mitad
De mi vida, olvida tus heridas why cúrame esta herida
He venido a suplicarte que tomes mis manos
Que me abrases muy fuerte why me digas te amo
Porque yo soy tu dueno aunque quieras negarlo
Aunque te aya perdido why no estés a mi lado
Que no me eches al olvido que extraño tu cuerpo
Cuando estoy dormido, cuando estoy despierto
Why cada mañana que ya no te tengo, me miro al espejo
Why me estoy muriendo, por que no estas aquí???

Al verte sonriendo en mis fotografias
Sino no lo recuerdas, tu vida era mia
Es que vivir sin tu presencia es querer
Esperar bajo en agua, si tu no estas conmigo

And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry

I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you

You tried to leave me high and dry.
Yes you nearly left me to die.
Sticks and stones may break my bones.
But your words, they never hit home.
Time to say good-bye to all the pain.
And chase away the rain.

Now there is wind in my sails.
And I cannot fail.

Let the good times roll.
Let the good times roll.

I'm a soldier and I will fight.
On through the darkness and into the light.
Now the ace is up my sleeve.
It's so good it's hard to believe.
I will take the journey to the end.
Until there is nothing left for you to defend.
Now the tables are being turned.
And it's time for you to burn.

Now there is wind in my sails.
And I cannot fail.

Promising death in its cruelest form.

In our face and curse us all.

Burning the shadows on the ground,
As the rain falls to dry the land,
Leaving desert for the thirsty man.

They all said it would end the war,
And we thanked Christ for the bomb,
And the priests and witches all agreed,
They should die to keep them free.

Someone screamed, I slap him
Look his daddy in his eyes and say I'm here to jack ya
Ask who else was in the house, he say its just his wife
Tied him up, layed him down, hit them with the knife
Ask em once he tried to play me, I don't play no games
Kicked his face, broke his nose, took that to his brain

Count money all day, count money all day, count money all 
Money all, money all day 

Say mane, no matter where I go, no matter what I do 
If chillin' wit' myself, or ballin' wit' my crew 
The skies is lookin' cloudy or Bahama water blue 
I got that money on my mind, so tell me what it do 
And if you be like me, then you already knew it 
We goin' for the money then we goin' right through it 
Take it to the table baby, chop it up and screw it 
'Cause it ain't nothin' to it where come from, but to do it 
We get it in our hands, and then it go right through the fingas 
We standin' on the system in a fresh set of swangas 
We pop a couple tags, put some fresh up on the hangas 
That everyday struggle and can't nair nigga change us 
Believe that I was famous 'fore I ever did a song 
Believe I had a poppin' 'fore a label put me on 
It's 2010 and I ain't seein' nothin' wrong 
But niggas countin' money all day fuckin' long

Money totin', pistol carrying young nigga thugged out 
Very first song I ever dropped was in a drug house 
Razor blades, sandwich bags, Louis shoes, stupid swag 
Rubber bands, duffel bags, small bills, trash bags 
Apple chain on my neck, you know that cost stupid cash 
Maserati for the watch, that's that foolish cash 
Penitentiary chances, '6's on a muscle car 
Bun helped me keep it real and watch it take me far 
My money don't fold, this money here 
I ain't make it for no hoes, I ain't get this off of shows 
Count money all day, count money all night 
Just know I'm wit' my paper, so I got my paper twice 
I be lonely wit' out my paper, so I sleep wit' it at night 
Now I wake up wit' to my paper so I start my day off right 
They call me Cocaine Gotti, and it's money over bitches 
Mr. Everything White, he be always in the kitchen

It's me Gucci 
I'm the shit bitch you smell me 
Ain't no need to check ya sneakers 
Three bricks, plus a split wit' me, then bitch you got a hit 
Big money on my leisure, pop bottles wit' top models 
Wit' my goons in Puerto Rico, 
Yo' girlfriend I'm a freak her 
Believe me I'm a giant, you down best leave us to believe us  
I own the team I play for, plus I coach 'em I'm the center
The hottest rapper that you know, people look like Cujo (Gucci) 
A coward dies a million times a soldier dies with uno 
So tune into East Atlanta uh, 
Please don't change the channel ma 
Roll the windows down back up 
In my Phantom show my automa 
Hangin' out my partner, naw

Bad bitch with me look like the Kardashians
Pull up in the club in that brand new Aston
Jumped I jumped the line cause I’m very important
Shawty got a kush habit, but I ain’t supporting it
She rock knockoff bags, it’s 2012
Tried to steal her some trues, so she just got out of jail
Boyfriend an athlete, baby daddy a dope boy
But she still get food stamps and still on welfare
But she phat as a motherfucker, I think she got ass shots
Stay in some red bottoms, don't know if they real or not
She have her ups and her downs, somehow she always go hard
She say she work for herself, ain’t going in nobody jobs

Don't you stress him over no B's, don’t buy things from off canal street
When the phone ring don’t ask who dialing

Now he got you, and he can’t live without you

Bitch always got her hand out, ho must think I’m paying out
Coming out the just house looking like that
In the club every week, on a new nigga dick
Bitch, We don’t like hoes like that, nevertheless, wife hoes like that
Think you bad somebody must’ve lied, ho your ass ain’t qualified

First of all yo gotti represent every thug
Went to school graduated operated with drugs
Had knowledge went to college fucking bitches with all
Up to no good in da hood but to play with my dawg
Been had six figures and that ain't no lie
I was fly class of 2000 at Trezvant High
I had gold like whoa! I just wanted to be 
A fucking lawyer but that was to long for me
Never knew I'll rob with the blackout squad
I admit when I was young shit I had a job
That was cool at first but I had to get paid
A 150 dollars a week must think I'ma slave
Maybe that's the reason why niggas been fucking with birds
Got the urge and the nerves to kick a bitch to the curb
I'm bout tied of bitches asking me have I been in love
I'm a human being bitch til I do pump blood
Let the rumor do some shit that a nigga didn't like
When I was young and dumb didn't know wrong from right
My old man telling me young cat walk like
Out of mind out of sight now my head on right

I tried me a 9 to 5 but it'n work
Put my trust in a bitch end up getting nerved

[verse 2]
I was 12 years old in the vista cove
I didn't want to get a job I want to sell me some more
I didn't want to go to church I wanted to get me some dough
Or a European Chevy with a matching vogue
They say I'm madeful ungrateful 'cause I ain't faithful
Good things come and go but I'll miss them later
Tip so niggas know gotti ain't they savior
I'm just trying to fuck all these hoes while I'm able
Big bro in and out the door cutting paper
Lil bro keep them out seen them getting paper
Gotti ask them questions when I seen them at the table
What the fuck is that? and what you doing with that razor?
I'm dead fucking serious
And while he smoking on some dro
And laughing I'm getting more and more furious
Real off experience I seen it first hand
That's why I had to make a plan to get them Benjamins

[chorus 4x]

[verse 3]
Nigga block on lock better tuck that shit
Ain't no motherfucker round that can fuck with this
Call nigga when they really won't infecting this
I&E rap hustlas getting checks for this
How many niggas you know that can go come from above?
Without a bill on the real yeen ain't fucking with us
I be tripping off bitches when they holla at us
With the mind frame they gone get some dollars for us
This a health train come on bitch swallow the nut
And follow it up by getting the fuck off the bus
Catching the cut what don't speak on trust
Don't know what it mean and me speak no English
And me don't work me a thug me no jerk
Back in the day me got my feelings hurt
But never again catch me fucking a friend
From 8 to 10 she ain't working nor getting revenge",9 to 5,2003
Yo Gotti,"[Chorus]
All I ever wanted to do was live the life
Money, drugs, cars, clothes hoes
Brick, paints, pounds of dro fa sho
A young nigga living how he supposed ya know

I got sixteen 28 grams broke down to dimes
What's my life like nigga its a constant grind
You got seven eight or nine you can push on
Cause I'm a selfish nigga I want 10 strong
Oh no it happened again
Let me get a good flow of that dro again
Got phone blowin' up like a high school bell
Plus the price sky rocket like dope in jail
Break it down in small portions fuck sellin' a O
You'd rather make seven or eight or cock bound for da 4
I'm a hustla far from being a busta nigga
You got good game but still don't trust ya nigga
You can catch me in the neighborhood winter or summer
Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to O's
O's to pounds I'm just holding it down

[Chorus: x2]

I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender
Have it rock hard plus white as December
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days
So if I get jam I know where it came from
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine
Some money come with blood and some money come with time
Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe
Money in the wrong way I'll lead you to the wrong place

[Chorus: x2]

I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row
And I wouldn't give a fuck if you nod or stay woke
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint
Back in Memphis Tenn with drank
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count
I'm a hustla' don't make me say it again
I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying
I'm congruent to them boys I'm out there slanging them pies
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed

Take a look in my life and see what I see..

[Yo Gotti]
M-E-M-P-H-I-S
3 - 8 - 1 - 2 - 7
shady vista, segshaw lane
my ghetto game, where it all started for gotti
little summin', running around (?) and naughty
asking for dollars from niggaz I assumed was ballin'
twelve years old, and talking about flippin' tomorrow
counting my cheese, think I had 'bout 37 bones
I made up my mind, tomorrow gotti's starting to cone
bought me a deal, posted up on top of the hill
throughout these years, i've seen a lot of niggaz get killed
my life is the truth, i'd rather rap outside a booth
y'all ain't talking about shit, i'm 100 proof..
that's what my life like

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
I'm from the projects, jaded in, fence surround
I'm a normal teen black, but these chinks around
'cause they on the corner stores, like how could they afford
something we can't, they never seen these dollars before
I wrote this here for the government, me and my people sufferin'
break bread with the immigrants, not word for recipients
tell me what my benefit, long jazz, fifty cents
eighty-five percent with no parole in parenthesis
the north memphis president, here to set the record straight
rob, steal, kill, put some food on your people plates
going lethal, thrill me, before these people kill me
gotti's just a spokesman for the north and they gon' feel me
my block consists of..  lost hope
gangbangers and street-thugs.. plus coke
there's one way in and one way out, take summin'
a cop working; wait for drought, like yo gotti

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
Back in the day, used to cut the five off of twenties
Back in the day, I used to cut the two off of tens
Back in the days, I thought everybody was friends
Back in the day, the hood had me trapped within
Back in the day, used to play ""pick up and run""
the shit was fun, but nowadays we picking up guns
Back in the day, me and my niggaz fought with each other
shared with each other, but nowadays we bust at each other
trust in each other just like we done sealed-up leather
never, we're all clever but on different levels
Back in the day, used to play ""that's my car""
Back in the days, I never thought i'd make it this far
Back in the day, used to play ""catch a girl, get a girl""
nowadays, niggaz let a girl ruin they whole world
last days, it was existing in the dirty south
ridiculous in the dirty south, come get me out this dirty south
my life like..

[Verse 1]
I got Mr. Tell It up on the phone
Disturbing peace inside my home
Tryna tell my biz and shit so he can get inside the throne
I guess the nigga like my song after I fucked a nigga's bitch

Ever since the third grade still got the same waves

My hoe know numbers Gotti on tip she relevant

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Mr. Tell It tell the truth, is you jealous or you jes?
Overprotected don't fuck around and get no injection
Not bout the bitch but bout the principle
That you want to see me living life miserable
They say bullets ain't got no name money ain't got no rules
And a bitch gone do what she want to
My street literature spit at her so quick and smooth
She give a fuck about the hustling doubts that you went through
So get yourself together dawg and tune in tonight
She want to fuck with a thug Mr. Tell It you too nice
All you want to do is lick her pussy and hit her bare
She want to fuck with a nigga that don't really care
Yo gotti hit the bitch and I'll never call her again
Same room same hotel next week with her friend
So Mr. Tell It I hope you linen (listen)
Stay the fuck up out my business

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Tell It don't shoot me down to knock a bitch
Mr. Tell It don't use my name, remember you the shit
I can't help I fucked your hoe, and yo 'cause, and yo sissta

Mr. Tell It want to pay be back, ain't that a bitch
My name ain't Kurt so remember that
Mr. Tell It these hoes already know that I'm a dawg
 Mr. Tell It can't say nuttin nice then don't speak at all
Mr. Tell It quit bothering me, watching me
Following like a private eye agency
Mr. Tell It just leave me alone
Cause on the real, I don't want to put one in your dome
So leave me alone

Quit leaving message bout where I was last week
It's understood, Mr. Tell It listen close
I ain't married and ya boy don't love the hoe

I'm a North Memphis Survivor...Survivor
I'm a North memphis Survivor...I'm a young nigga, money and power

[Yo Gotti]
I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it
Couldn't though, why? 'cause I owed the nigga for it
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda
I remember this shit like it was yesterday
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go

[Chorus repeat- X2]
I'm on the motherfucking grind
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine

[Yo Gotti]
What am I to do now, where am I to go?
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared
And all the other niggaz looking up side my head
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper
72 hours had 28 elither
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
One week later had 4 and a split
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own
Mama let me back in, mama real strict
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true
So what the fuck a nigga gone do
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click

[Chorus repeat-X2]",On da Grind,2003

Look here, you know what I mean, I done did a lot of
shit in my life, Yo Gotti, street raised street paid...

[chorus]
I'ma sell my dope can't trust no bitch
Pop my wheel break bread with my click
If a nigga don't hustle than a nigga don't eat
steady chasin paper out here running these streets
I'ma sell my dope can't trust no bitch
Pop my wheel break bread with my click
Kinfolks we block burn till we get these mills
We do it how it go so we gone get it how we live

I'm back to the basics
Face it I'm back on the rise
Back with my guys
Back 22 for them pies
I'm back rollin' clean
Back lookin' mean at niggaz
That's throwin' up signs
Lettin' off rounds for mine
Back in the hood
Like my niggaz think I should
But knockin' on wood
They got a nigga back on that good
Back on a mission
In other words I'm back in the kitchen
Water whippin' with my niggaz tryin' to sew up the city
Back in school
Gotti back to actin' a fool
But seekin' some knowledge
Southwest community college
Took hold a nigga
Enrolled and showed a nigga
When Gotti around, ain't enough hoes for niggaz
Never did I
Get the big head or lie
And say I'm the mayne
I just said I'm workin' with change
And doin my thang
I can't help I don't trust hoes
Move birds on the low and seen a hundred or mo'

[chorus]

You want to sue me? You want to rob me?
Get your choppers come to my shows and try to mob me?
I took birds from your people
So you gone kill me
Say my beats be aight
But you don't really feel me
Dog, I ain't hard to find I be in the bay
Ridgecrest, Shady Vista street everyday
Sellin yay with my nigga G.B. and Todd
Lil' Mont Big G we all got heart
Rap shit aight but I'm from the streets
Under all circumstances I gotta eat

Double up make 'em bounce whoa...Look at my mouth
Blockburner nigga be rollin'

[chorus]

Dope just (???) and can't stop me from gettin this paper
Nineteen years a closet full of gators
Platinumed out chain beggets around my charm
One hundred fifty shots shtos four five caliber drum
Got 4 spots
One for the money
One for the drugs
A third spot for all of these hoes that I don't love
A fourth spot for me and my shorty that stayed down
The one who stayed strong and helped me through shady grounds
I'm a mean mugger,head buster
Nothin nice
I'm a street hustler
And my motto is rock ice
Streets is callin
Why not picture me ballin
Enjoy it while I got it cause one day I'm gone be fallin
Dope boys do what they want not what they can
You boys tag along and protect the man
Cheap hoes jockin them niggaz cause they got paper
All hoes change like weather because it's nature

Then I dream voices hit my ski-lo

Old school throw back Memphis sho-bo
Lorenzo jersey to hide the 4-O

Sorry mommy ya boy don't smizzo
But you can let your boy burn brain in the G-4

If your nines in the car, 'cause mines on my side
Why you lookin' like dat?
Nigga ain't no hoes here
I'm about to ask the waitress what she put in yo' beer
We can get it on, we can do whatever boy (whatever boy)

This should hit you, get you pump, if it get you drunk
It can get you jump!

You don't know if they like your car, they don't like you
By the way they lookin', you can't tell if they grimmin' you or admiring you
Whether envy you when they see your tires spinnin'
So you greet 'em as polite
Ly as possible, that nine sit on yo lap, be disrespectful then you leave 'em at the light
Hit that window and squeeze that toaster
Pull off fast and I promise
That I just put his Regal in 3-wheel motion without havin' hydraulics
I call it like I see it
Walk it like I did it
Nigga coughin' up yo kidney
Cough, talkin' bout the kid
My people, I came expectin' the same kinda respect that you want
Some of you steppin' in something by coming and testing it once
They won't let you do nothin' unless you cutting a check
Let me ask you a couple a questions, nigga

I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

[Chorus: x2]

This for all my street niggas and bitches
From M Town to H-Town
Free Pimp C, shit

Here we come, we keepin' it trill
Ain't no need to ask if you see
Ain't nobody gon' keep it triller than me
Myself and I that's Bun B
I'm a G, I'm a boss, I grip grain and I sip lean
I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key
I be in the Caddy rollin' on women damn near older than me
Them screens six inches or better, the stitches in the leather
If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together
Cause when I pull up at the valet man
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us
Women wanna be with us and fellas they wanna be us
We the G's and don't try to fight it, got dro and we fixin' light it
Laid back and that thang up on us we startin' to get excited
I'm ballin' with Yo Gotti and Eightball two of Memphis tightest
Cause we havin' a gangsta party man everyone's invited

[Chorus: x2]",Gangsta Party,2006
Yo Gotti,"Already, 
Know what I'm sayin' this Birdman and this how it's goin' down, 
That little youngin' Yo Gotti I certified him stamped approval and the jail,

They got you fucked up, then get you fucked we been movin' birds bitch

Quarters, quarters and halves, 
Chickens, chickens, and bricks, bundles, 
Bundles of dope, and ounces, ounces and shit  
Quarters, quarters and halves, 
Chickens, chickens, and bricks, bundles,

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman

Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin', 
I run it myself like a quarterback option, 
I pitch a 10 G's tell a bitch to go shopping, 
She buy herself some clothes, 
And she brought me back a chopper, 
See niggas tryna kick it, 
But no I don't play soccer, 
I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker, 
A package on the way you know my whip game proper,
And all for one key I see seventy thousand dollas, 
Now I was shootin' dice, smokin' on a joint, 
I bet wit Yo Gotti, 
He hit five straight points, 
We ova' here hustlin', 
We ova here grindin', 
You rap about money and nigga might sign ya, 
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya, 
But ? yo ass what you hear right behind you
Dope game bitch let his mama worry bout him, 
You can holla at me for a fee but I

All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman

I met the Birdman with the Bird layin', 
Got a twenty piece, brought it back to north Memphis charged twenty two a piece, 
Now I'm in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender, 
Low key in a rental, with them thangs in the fender, 
See I full time grind January to December, 
Put that snow in the summer got it lookin' like the winter,
I'm goin' back to Cali, I gotta get that light green, 
Mexico valley, you know they got them pine trees, 
18 wheeler, now I'm on I-10, on my way to Memphis,
I gotta get my hands in, 
I come from the north where gangstas gon' grind, 
Bitch niggas gon' whine, and hustlas gon' shine, 
Everybody say they trappin' but most of these niggas lyin', 
I told slim, told stunna I'm waitin' for my time, 
Either robbin', or poppin', click clack I shot 'em, bullets burryin', brr I got em'

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman

Back where I started on my set in black, 
Hop out the passenger side of my back, 
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack, 
But in my palm I had that chromed out mac, 
Shinin' on them bitches cause nigga I'm 'bout that,
Flip a quarter bird to score a whole sack, 
Pull up in the club in a old school 'lac, 
With a bitch ridin' fly so hide you love that, 
It's grind time, nigga been about that, 
We flippin' birds let them hoes go to sacs, 
We livin' large with the garbage bag flats, 
Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack, 
And ridin' fly, 25's on the back, 
Plushed out nigga keep a few stacks, 
Out the hood, 'bout money that's that,
If you ever cross the line best believe you gettin' whacked

[Chorus]

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman",I Got Them,2006

She was light, bright, damn near white wit them ; chinese eyes and big gurl thighs 
And it was ; so many rumors and so many lies about my 
So many girls and so many wives that it ; broke up my home she left me alone and I was 
Tryna explain to her on the phone but I'm like ; what was the use of tellin the truth 'cause I was 
Traind as a youth to do wut I do so I jus ; tell her sum lies to make her feel good like 
One day I'm movin you out the hood it went from ; kisses and hugs to pushes and shoves but that was 
All a part of fuckin wit thugs cum on

[chorus]
If you was down you would steal fo a nigga ; stay by my side even kill fo a nigga
If you fuck wit a nigga for real ; it ain't nothin to keepin it trill

[verse 2]
She jus ; wantd to smile and wantd a child but I was
Ruinin her dreams by livin too wild she said I ; need to cum down and act like a man
And my response was like ; wut the fuck is you sayin
'cause I was ; so caught up in the movin and white that I was
Gone 24-7 a night and I didn't
Give a fuck if I was wrong or was right 'cause I wuz a ; D Boy livin a D Boy life and she was a
School girl slash D Boy wife and it was ; in wit the wrong and out wit the right 'cause she was
Traffickin, manufacturin drugs but dat was ; all a part of fuckin wit thugs

If you was down you would steal fo a nigga ; stay by my side even kill fo a nigga
If you fuck wit a nigga for real ; it ain't nothin to keepin it trill

[verse 3]
We was ; tighter than fam, cooler than friends
We thought it wuld ; las forever and never wuld end
And we'd get ; mad at each other and try to pretend
Like we was ; callin it quits wasn't speakin again
We went out ; separate ways for a couple of days
You kno that ; separate phase sum hell of a days
Like uh ; I regret ever doin her friend
But it was the ; heat of the moment and you kno us men
We jus ; think wit out actin my mind was back trackin
But still ; I say wut I mean and I mean was I say 'cause I'm real
So play ya position and show us sum love

INE bitch",That's What's Up (Intro),2006
Yo Gotti,"Mama, we're gon' be aight

Man, I miss my brother, I swear to God
I'm still mad at myself that I couldn't take the charge
I remember like yesterday, phone ringing up off the hook
Pandemonium in the north, what happened to juk?
Shit, I don't know, guess the same old bullshit
Fed's said, DP got caught with half a brick

That damn near stopped my heart
'Cause me and knowing my brother I'm thinking this shit hard
But luckily it was soft and fortunately he was straight
We're findin' to take it to trial, but went on sign for eight
Mama, we're gon' be straight, lil' sister we're gon' be cool
I know that my brother strong, so I did what I had to do

Mama, we're gon' be aight
He gon' be okay
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith
Li'l sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

Mama, we're gon' be aight
He gon' be okay
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

His sister taking it bad, mama trying to be strong
Couple calendar years, I never shedded a tear
Wrote him a couple letters to tell him I'm doin' better
Told him, I took his Chevy and put the shit back together
Told him, I'm gettin' money, I counted a hundred G's
Told me to slow it down, play the shit low key
Told me to make it happen, focus more on rappin'

'Cause fuckin' round in these streets that anything can happen
Told me I had heart, plus he knew I was smart
The only thing that'd break his heart is
If I fuck around and catch a charge
Told me to watch my sister and never let mama suffer
And do what I had to do to overcome the struggles

Mama, we're gon' be aight
He gon' be okay
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

Mama, we're gon' be aight
He gon' be okay
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

Finally made parol, they think he gon' change his life
I axed him what he gon' do, he said he's gon' walk light
It wasn't a year later, he smokin' behind tint
Half an ounce of the reddy rock, man they got his ass again

Judge gave him a bond, now he out on the run
With that fuck the world attitude, still totin' a gun
Still havin' his fun, we clubbin' it on the weekend
Thought I had conversations 'bout going to turn himself in
Wanted to raise his son, gon' get the shit behind him
Plus he knew it's only so long before they find him

Lawyer was talking good, say he gon' get three
When the prosecutor quit yellin' they gave my brother eleven
My mama damn near fainter, my brother didn't want to accept it
The hardest part for me, I couldn't do nothing to help it
Rap shit paid off, now we all on TV
My brother say, he good, he finally feel free

Mama, we're gon' be aight
He gon' be okay
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

Mama, we're gon' be aight
He gon' be okay
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith
Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

Is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy

Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down

No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid

Dats a hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita
Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 diamond I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mommy I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizing for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse yea",Outro,2006

Yo Gotti,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

Shawty know I like head, she ain't trippin' at all
She go down on a nigga' and she a-swallow it all
Me and her done it all, catch us both at the mall
She can get what she wanna and it ain't trickin' at all
Shawty fuck with her nigga' her nigga' fuck with her back
She put her life on the line 'cause she a-ride with this sack
Wen I went back to the hood hustlin', movin' them birds

She at home with my child I be flirtin' in the crowd
I need help I can't control myself these 'hoes be wild
Sometimes I think to myself, another nigga' in my bed
So I stop thinking all that shit'll fuck yo' head.
I take federal chances I work so hard for the bread.
Wonder if she a-keep it real if I eva' go to the fed
She gon' write me and visit me like I think that she should
Or she gon' disrespect me fuck another nigga' out the hood
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her

How to be one way

You had nowhere to go I let you move in my house
You can jump in my Benz, go stunt out on ya' friends
I took you all around the world and I a-do it again
You respected my grind 'cause you knew I had that work
And I respected ya' mind because you still went to work

I pulled up to the club on dubs
They say look at them go
Look at them go
And raised up with some girls tryin' to cut 3 times in the room
Times in a room
Cause I spent 20 on my tires
30 to be icy
But me bein' fly that's priceless
And I gave 40 to my side chick
50 to the wifey
But me bein' fly that's priceless
Baby that's priceless

Err but the projects
Postin' that's the object
Me talkin' cash
Then you better switch the topic
Bitch nigga stop it
Gon' ahead and cop it
Money in the bag
Probably takin' out the garbage
I know them boys snitchin'
Cause they're scared of 1st degree
But you can tell em f.e.d's
I'm in VIP
With 4 mill chedda' keep boy keys
The window to the wall
Supplier of what you need

Got no wife but the wife be my girlfriend
My girlfriend girlfriend
Lookin' for a girl friend
Nick name tail spin
Meet you in da whirlwind
Lord hear the way
Now they ask you where the world went

I'm so fly
Not to mention that I'm priceless
Ya ain't never seen
Heard of them
None like this
Thousand dollar jeans
Air force 2 Nike's
Prowlin' in the club
Give a fuck about indictments
You can bartender but the drinks on me
2 magnums in my hand
One fo' creeps one fo' freaks
Too much legal tender
So its raining bubbly
My ice the same color
How Kelis used to be

Hold up wait a minute
Pop pop niggas ain't even they spinnin'
I made a make dollars
So it have to make sense
I'm born out liquor
I'ma dead president
All long day
All long die
Toe tag money see it fallin' out the sky
Bitch if I'm priceless
Then bury me alive
My pockets like caskets
Death live inside

Alligator wit the sways
50 on the carpet
All yellow hard 8s
Scarface white leather
Purple cush
Green all red shinin' any weather
Customized jeeps for high priced life nigga
Get it till you cant no mo
Shop till you cant no mo
10 on some new shoes
50 on the boy
100 on some new jeans
And give a fuck bout the price
Precious little tight blue heart on my mike

See money ain't the algebra let's get it clear, clear
This is not a gift it's a souvenir, nir
See maybe I'm that nigga who knows how to ball, I am
He Spud Webb height, but the money tall
Audemar his and hers
Body's straight hips and curves
Friends hanging on your nerves
Trying to tell 'em I don't want your girls
I'm come from another world
Money do not grow on trees
That's why I had to hustle her and get my money out the streets

My money long money strong bitch I'm ? paid
I'm throwing shots back like it's k-k-kool aid
I got them co coo shades
Them shit is crazy dark
I got two shortys feeling on each others lady parts
Play your part
Know your role
That mustang cold painted Olympic gold
I cal her Elenore you know that Shelby rips
I'm gone in sixty ticks
T-t-t-t-ticks
Before my deal I cut 'bout sixty  chicks
Acrobatics got my money turning sixty flips
Old schools I be on that sixties shit

To the early morn 50 grand in my pocket like Ivan Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown neck kinda freezy boy
Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)

Now my money on 4s now you best believe it

From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever

Yo Gotti,"Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch talkin' bout burr
I'm talkin' homegirl be lookin' like she just stepped outta a magazine
I'm talkin' niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious

Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

[Chorus]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realist nigga walkin'
And this the remix and still I'm out here lookin'
For a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her
With a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

[Chorus]

See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick
She been strugglin' for hers
From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like Coming To America
All my Louis luggage
You see my bag, how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin' on to E-Trade

[Chorus]

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' fuck 'em, with a dildo sign
Bye little Mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen
Barbie
I'm hot I think its time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin' and leavin'

I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner
She a go girl, and I’m trying to get with her
Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter
She’s a go girl

Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing

Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard
Don’t smoke or roll the weed up
If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl

OK now whoa there, keep going, throwing
That big booty, dong in
She wear her heart on her sleeve
Now she just Comme des Garconing

I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

Yo Gotti,"If I should die for our way
I pray the streets my world to take
Divide throughout the unfortunate
Give my jewelery to the most respected
My car to the one that's giving my guns to the gunners
You know what I'm saying

Cocaine thoughts, fish scale visions
Pray the Lord forgive a nigga, streets is my religion
Amen (amen), amen (amen)
Can I hear hood niggas scream amen
This my testimony, testimony
My testimony, testimony
This my testimony, testimony

Amen (amen), amen (amen)
Can I hear hood niggas scream amen

See I'm a different type of nigga, I'm on that different shit
Every day I wake up, I want a different bitch
I don't want the whip plain, I want the kit on it
Talking rims so big, they can feed on it
I just bought a different watch, and another chain
Fuck around and call my bitch another name
Got confession to make, you hoes look the same
And I'm so full of that liquor, it oughta be a shame
Say the rap game changed, alot of niggas stressin'
But between me and you, nigga that's a blessin'
fake niggas come up, real niggas suffer
Record labels fuckin' niggas, that's why I don't trust 'em
This my testimony (my testimony), I made it true to see
Hope the Lord forgive a nigga, streets is my religion
Now I can get a amen, or can you bless a nigga with a thousand eight grams

The streets left no love in a nigga

If I could paint a picture
I would show the image of a dog ass nigga
Yeah, raw ass nigga
Popping pain killers
Praying for a call, four dogs with them pistols
Natural born killers
We sold crack to his mother, he turn his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug
He think everything a hustle
Cold motherfucker
Oh no, I’m black hearted
No feelings, just a gun
We was raised in the trenches
Not to mention all the hoes had dissed him
So homes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him,
Grandpa Klan lynched him,
He raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kind of hard to adapt
So homes turned to the strap
To succeed tried rap, couldn’t fight got slapped
Shot dice threw craps, did time back out, damn

My words like multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like a search light in the darkness
For this young, black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces, or they corpses now
In God we trust But it’s bucks that we worship, now
Boy that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See, I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit
He said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, now
Feeling guilty, ""What would Momma think about me?""
Told’ em, think about it nigga, won't you think about it now?
But he was money hungry
Plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy
Burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial, like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit
Tears soak the handkerchief

Swear that she ain’t never shown weakness, real shit
That created the hunger
And that make the monsters
Got the game from my mama, that’s some ill shit
13 on the block, he was a little kid
In the kitchen, on the stove like it’s a cook out
No nigga mouth to the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over he got took out (bang)
Brains leaking, they sneaked him , he ain't even see it coming
He a hitter, he won’t focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends shooting dice

Young nigga in the hood watching out for hustlers

Hardaway nigga got my meals the harder way
Selling crack music now I run some smarter ways
Exit the game and got rich that's a fade-away Ha
What a millionaire look like
Yea I can show him how to cook right
Turn a NaN to a half
Turn a brick to a jag
Nigga you do the math if you can add right
Mixtape doing shows for the forty
All I need is one mic and a Glock 40
Tour bus full of killers
Whenever I'm in the building
Then build the cake to the ceiling
Can't describe the feeling

I am the legend fortunately
I am success fortunately
Imagine life in the crisp
Young nigga with techs
Head shots in the day
Throwing our lives away
I understand though
I come from that land home
Ounce of yay will kill a nigga
And I was the man. Ho
Shots fired
Bullets fired
Coming out that van door
Family crying
Seen that shit so many times
Heart cold

Mafia
I grew up when three 6 shit was popular
I was hustling thugging keys of cocaine and would pop it up
I had bricks down Choppers up
And won't no nigga real as us
City fucking with me cuz they know a nigga really fuck
Yea. Then this shit got easy
Told my dog I had a mil

On me to buy you a bag, but is you worthy?
Nah, I ain't perfect!
And I just followed you on Instagram
Are you really into women and that you get around?
Now I ain't judging, I'm just asking if that's fair to say
But either way, it's my opinion, you know give or take!
I told this model chick,
The girls look up to you and the things you do
Every nigga you work with, you're screwing,

You don't know me, you don't pay my bills
You don't know my struggle,
Like this she real, but it is what it is
But I know you lying, I know what's real
I know your worth, I know that purse

Don't call me out at my momma's given.
Name sacred, she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs
And I leave her inner feelings, cause I never leave her dry!
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised
She know these Jones on my John, but I still give her time.
I try follow her, everybody want her
Worried about none if she gonna work that body!

Spent five thousand dollars on some shoes
That’s what you call stuntin’
I turn in none, Ran into my freak bucket
Then turn a pussy, ran into my cute puppet
No ventriloquist, I make it talk to me
I’m the richest nigga in my hood
10 chains on me, smoking Cali good
Private plane luggage never necessary
I can take you where they never could
That super fly shit is mandatory
Chasing all this money, I just can’t avoid it
Jesus piece’s only keeping me anointed
Getting richer, niggas highly disappointed
But erm

I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true
Cos my ass woke up in that Bugatti coupe
That bitch ain’t got a roof
This 1.5 on a a Coupe
Rich gang, nigga dreams come true
Bad bitch, I make her dreams come true
Rich gang, nigga dreams come true
Dope boy, I’m a dream come true
I believe dreams come true

And I done seen dreams come true
Bentley truck ’bout to drop, give me two
Presidential rollies for my whole crew
Me and bird see the world through a birds eye view
Man we started from the bottom now we here
GT V bottles at the table, no beer
Hustlers’ my career, never had fear
I’m flying on a lear high, rest in peace Aaliyah
Man I spent 3.5 Million on a crib
Young hot boy, had to get how I live
The main question is:
Why am I always smiling and I’m living?
I was born with the drive, now a nigga get driven
Young Money

I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true

Rich gang, nigga dreams come true
Dope boy, I’m a dream come true
I believe dreams come true

And I done seen dreams come through
11 hundred cantana, sock on the new shoe
Moving birds out the coupé
The sun do shine, we can knock him off for the loop
Stunna Island! Out the pound homie
Stunna Island! With my rounds homie
Moving eleven, strapped with a mack
A hundred G’s in a dufflebag stacked
White doves, and we serving out of Bentley
Uptown, moving round, now we filthy
Paint the whole town
Red on that brown, lay ‘em all down

Got a bad bitch with me and she all that
She ain’t nothing but a jump shot, all that
Ya'll suckers playing foul like Artest

Selling all these bricks, need a hard hat
I hit your ho one time, never call back
Say these chickens used to wanna be like Mike

Long nose like Ginobili nigga
5 rings like Kobe nigga
I was flippin kilo after kilo
Rockin that Versace shit way before Migos
Started with them grams at the project with a stack
Then I flipped it to a brick and then I did the Project Pat
Like, homie what’s the problem?
Semi or revolve em
Catch a nigga with the bricks, you know we goin' rob em
Once I caught the lick we was fresh up out the drop
Man the bitches on the corner watch a player like the scout
I said all I wanted was a kilo
All them bitches wanna free load
All I wanted was a drop with the head cracked like Cee Lo
36 them O’s nigga
Thousand grams on gold nigga
Power plans with the blow nigga
DC, coke boys nigga
On da corner, pistol on me
Smoking on California
10 chains, catch pneumonia
Yea

Ain’t no refunds nigga
Wanna get your money back?
Better bring your guns nigga
And no receipts in the streets
All sales, you know they final nigga
So if you lose some then it’s your loss
If you don’t way up then scale off
If you trap right it’ll pay off

Teflon, bulletproof the Lambo
Hate rats, got my niggas in the fed
Got money in the bank and money on my head
Really? Niggas sound silly
Wanna talk money, yeah, just counted ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga better Google me
Boy, I really made a million out the fuckin' streets
Boy, I had a white car back in '04
Back in runnin' wood days and ride low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you, nigga?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer
Nah, LA Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the jacks, empower the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

My auntie did 20 years, my pop did like 16
My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?
Really, ho, Billie Jean jackets in my video
Causin' all this racket, on a tennis court
Really made a million in a kitchen fork
Skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt, dinner fork
Often offended, I told that bitch to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends, that's what it is
Verbal telekinesis
Korrupt mixed with Jesus
Big Meech mixed with Yeezus
Keep playin' them games and get shot from them bleachers
I still got my stripes when I'm not wearing Adidas
Got a fresh hairline from Peter
Got me a hockey mask, choppers, started talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter
Niggas ain't killing shit, niggas they playing
They saying they killing shit
Got me an A and a K and a 220 trey
And the shit hit, might burn a little bit
I'm like, ""Really, little bitches, say really""

Fuck these niggas
Niggas say they gon' kill me

Brand new Benz with the top down
In my old neighborhood, all the cop 'round
I don't give a fuck, motherfucker, act up
Let him and the police hear how the Glock sound
Comin' with the bullshit, get shot down
Sucker free, no fly zone in my town
And there ain't no discussion
It's simple, you try me we gon' get to bustin'
I promise, my nigga, you want it, my nigga?
My young niggas ready, they goin' on God
They act like they know ain't no God
We so official, for sure, no facade
Trap a nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my .44 in the door
I'n not finna play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K, myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
Give your boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect, boy, you violate me, we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map
And you still reachin' your hand out for no dap
My demonstration in exchange for your hatin'
I put this flame all in your face, boy you fakin'
We come through in Mercedes and shoot you
You'd think Call of Duty would make it
Bacon, I get my moolah off top
He don't give me my moolah, off top
Give a damn what the naysayers say
And we waitin' a day in the A with the K and I'm gone

Spent some time in twin towers, I ain't goin' back
Spent my commissary on some M&M's thinkin' I was Eminem
Runnin' Aftermath in all black
I'll slaughter your house with 5 9's
Leave all of you niggas with crooked eyes
Got the Louisville Slugger, Big Papi Ortiz
Knockin' every button off your buttoned up sleeves
Please that's Jeezy the Snowman
Comin' straight to your window like Bruh Man
Said I ain't killin' your dog but stealin' my hog and fuck my conscience
Puttin' bullets in your doberman, don't fuck with Compton
Don't you fuck with Kendrick, don't fuck with Problem
Don't fuck with YG, I'm Mr. Miyagi, Daniel San, I handle them
My handle's dumb, I had no gun
Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuckin' dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Boi around
And when a nigga say ""Timber"", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down
Fuck you clowns, yeah I put the word on you niggas
Don't A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at T.I.P. or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that Detox come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over

But fuck nigga, I give these hoes the business
And I put that on me, I ain't never give no statement
I ain't never copped no plea
I let money fight my cases, I get money and I go hard
I let haters do the hating
When you pussies ready to face me, I be right here just waiting
Matter fact I'm getting patient
Sipping on that hen' getting wasted
I'ma catch a murder one and I can taste it
How you get so far, then go back to the basis

Glock .40, Smith & Wesson nigga
Streets will never ever stop testing niggas
Youngin' give 'em a head shot, send a message nigga
Part rapper, part goon, still finessing nigga
I believe in hustle I don't fuck with luck
And it's fuck em kill em all if they don't fuck with us
Them three letters mean a lot boy, sacrifices
Cocaine Mafia, double check the prices
Niggas killing niggas like they got a license
Niggas crossing over like they Allen Iverson
Fuck that iPhone 6, they be tracking niggas
I'm about to get a beeper, fade to black on niggas
Gotti, goodnight, I'm gone
I be back when they quit living through phones
When niggas put the gram down and pick the grams up
You got follows but no dollars man that shit ain't adding up
Nah, and all the dirt I done, all the bricks I sold
I can't sleep at night, paranoid it shows
I be strapped on stage, fuck the award show
'Cause I shoot this bitch up and only God knows

Yeah like I told you a long time ago fam, y'all my motivation
I keep fighting doing this for y'all.
Every time I get somethin' in the mail
Whether it's strapable or not from the courts
I keep putting it down because y'all my motivation.
I appreciate the love

Niggas riding gold rims and they mama po'
And they kill a family member for that envelope
I'm the Lionel Richie to these Commodores
We flip pies to franchising Dominoes
I speak for dope boys every track I'm on
Until this day my people never rat or told
Posted 20 in, I'm talking fed pen
The line between us both have gained so very thin
Amongst my boys of W.E.B. Du Bois
Souls of black folk to hustle wasn't a choice
Rap game everybody skimming off the top
Fuck interest as long as you pull it off the lock
Hoes wanna fuck, haters wanna hate
Certified sack boy, black Ronald Reagan
Double M no longer that Buick Regal money
Nickel bag niggas so don't make me put a kilo on it
Negotiating for it or either we take it
Niggas even shooting choppers in a fuckin' cadence
Fell out with some people that I still love
I guess that's how it goes when it's real blood
I remember counting cash standing in the trap
I turned my hat to the back, had a hundred stacks
60 m's later and 300 tax
Still losing weight with the south on my back, nigga

If I knew my nigga was getting high
Then he couldn't buy it from me
You my lil nigga, lil nigga money no value to me
I took lil Keion out the hood and changed his life foreal
Ask him you can post up on this hill or go to Beverly Hills
It's on you, if you ain't 'bout that action, why the fuck you lie?
If you the realest nigga, then who the fuck am I?

A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
I hear these niggas out here talking like they killers
The same ones who scared to put that on they life
I ain't trying to impress nobody
I ain't trying to stress nobody
I hear these niggas out here saying they the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?

I'm the type to put my niggas on
I'm the type that want to see you rich
You the type to go blow your check
Just for Instagram and a sneaky bitch
I'm the type to pull off the lot
Then look at yo then say you can too
I can't wait for my nigga Bo
To bust down that block in a two door coupe
There go twelve, higher than I ever been
Mambo hide that scale
Bitch I been a heavyweight
You niggas too frail
You might break my heart
But you can't break this truth I tell
Real niggas do cry too
When my album drop, hope you buy two
When it's all done I'mma die true
I said real niggas do try to
Hella naked bitches playing Taboo
Done turned the mansion to a damn zoo

A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?

Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming maintaining that they factors
When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?

She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit

You a million dollar nigga got to get that in your brain
Now get that in your brain, it's all about the aim
We savages we all live the same
And it's the art of war nigga like the art of hustle nigga
They looking for the goonies but I'm the muscle nigga
I'm a shooter like Durant
I got heart like Russell nigga
I lost a million to the plug I never trust another nigga
What if I sell a million records will that change the code
Will my niggas try to betray me 'cause I know they vultures
Will LA Reid see my vision, will he see me wrong
Create me a better way to put my people on
Will my baby mama finally quit texting my phone
Kiss my daughter and my son tell 'em I'm coming home
Tell my niggas put the pistols down I'm in the zone
I been dropping nothing but gangsta shit on every song
And this the shit that they been waiting for forever long
They gave my patna 30 years for talking on the phone
I had to watch his mama cry and tell her let's be strong
Imma hold him down he won't do all that time alone
What if I wasn't a rapper the streets would get annoyed
'Cause don't nobody tell it how I tell it and you know it
What if they say I changed 'cause I went outside the box
What's good I kept my plug number so I can get some blocks
18 wheeler full of cocaine I'm talking lots of dope
Not believing Mexican plugs fuck a horoscope
If you a star where your telescope
These niggas high they on hella dope
Your favorite rapper hella broke
Cars leases they got hella notes
Houses rented got eviction notes and everybody already know
You fabricated and I'm factionated
You sold a million records I got millions of dollars

We used to have to make it through the year now it's the summer
And everybody mob somthin’, everybody rob somethin’
Everybody scrap and everybody shot somethin’

Killin’ like they got a license
Life used to be priceless now it’s worthless
Niggas gone on missions ain’t even worth it
Homie chill (chill), lil homie chill (Chill)

Biggest record of my career, I’m becomin’ a star
And I’m shootin’ a AR out the car
Look at your favorite rapper
Just be patient, he gon’ fuck up, he a Memphis nigga
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t
Thuggin’ in a nigga
Money don’t change that, fame can’t change that
I’ve done shit to niggas in the streets I can’t take back
So every second of my life I got a gun and I hate that
But this Memphis, if you get caught without you gon’ regret that

Yo Gotti,"I remember, see I remember like yesterday
Vividly, everythin' I went through

I remember long nights, days
Been fucked up on steppin' my ice game
Openin' that door stages then the lights came
Went to Mexico, met a plug, then my life changed
And I was on vacation
Never was with waitin'
Always been impatient
Always 'bout the money
Never been with hatin'
Believe in loyalty, I had my niggas fight they cases
Don't believe in hope, I tell 'em hold they head
I tell 'em stack they bread
I tell 'em pipe it down
Before you get up in the feds, homie talkin' loud
Between you, I think you scared
'Cause if you really was the problem, he'll end up dead
And that's some real shit
I don't talk about niggas 'cause it's a waste of time
And when I talk to my young'ns, I tell 'em go and grind
And when I talk to the plug, I tell him double up
It's summer time, nigga tryna fuck the city up
I remember my first 9 like yesterday
All base, fucked off the kitchen off an ounce of yay
Plug don't give a fuck, he like niggas still got to pay
My ounces 24 grams, not 28
That's the make up and every day I wake up
Grab my stap and talk to God, make sure that I'm prayin'
'Cuh once I leave the house I may bump into a hater
And I might shoot his ass in the face, straight up
Don't believe in hoe problems so I leave these hoes
You did that time by yourself so you don't need these hoes
I'm worth 20 mil nigga, got 100 to go
If it was 5, it's half, it's bigger than O
I been a partner with LA Reid and Jay Z
I'm still hangin' with niggas who coppin' half of keys
Still runnin' with niggas gettin' pounds
And still game to lay your ass down, nigga, for real

Big bridge on 'em, we in the kitchen with this shit

My whips KKK white and my guns negro
Black, white, white, black, I'm color blind

Yeah this CM9, streets call for it
It was just a matter of time
And the phone sell the record, fuck I'm still fine
I'm a still hold my head high and still shine, yeah
I drop without a single
Man I used to throw 10 thousand singles
Used to have my dope in a can of Pringles
I sell sac for sac and pack for pack
Can 30, I done this and that
Street nigga at heart and I'm oldschool
My niggas used to smoke loud, now they on dog food
It's no average life, nigga this savage life
Partner killed a partner, go to the funeral, go the burial
Talk to his mama, this shit can get scary
I'm known, can't none of this is gon' worry us
The cars material, money deteriorate
Bitches gon' vanish and fame illuminate
I got plaques on the wall, niggas in the jailhouse
Got my advance check, bail my niggas out
Played my role nigga, fishin' them birds out
When you the kingpin, there ain't shit you can tell 'bout
Look around nigga, who you see
Givin' street niggas chances, Lamorghini, 200k advance
And that ain't label money, that was mine nigga
'Cause my young'ns got the same dream as mine nigga
You tryna be a young millionaire, me too
Move your family out the hood, me too
We jump coupes
And we ain't makin' WorldStar, we makin' news
So don't get this shit confused, nigga

I remember when they tried to play me, huh
Notice how I said 'try'
On everythin' I love, that will never happen
I remember when I made my first milli'
I remember, on everythin' I love, I remember
I remember when they tried to count me out
So I counted it up
On my mama, I remember
I also remember those that showed love
I'm forever grateful
I swear to God, I remember
I remember, they wanted to see me broke
They wanted to finish me
They wanted me to be miserable
So I decided to make 25 milli'

Then I introduced you to this Cocaine Muzik
And every other day you expressed your love for Ray
And your love for Ye then we used to debate
'Bout how your partners in the industry thought I still sold yay
We were both geeked up by doin' the deal with Jay
I got my first number one and you was on the run with me

I'm just movin' how I'm movin' and like
You were  just the nigga always could get through to me
I don't even know like, how you was able to do it like
Like when the whole shit about
They were tryna get me to go overseas for years and years
And I ain't give a fuck how my money was, I just
I wasn't movin' like that 'cause
All my niggas convicted felons
I couldn't get the straps across the motherfuckin' customs

""You really need to do this for your career, this made it
Be on the biggest record in Europe right now""
And I'm still like, ""Fuck it"", you know what I mean like? I wasn't even trippin'

I knew you was loyal when your partner went to jail
You never missed a court date, you stayed on the lawyer
And I know P. Mims gonna miss you he was really for you
Use to tell me to my face when I would bull of shit
I ain't tryin' to win, I'll do some other shit
I respect you for that more than you'll ever know
I had issues with niggas, you told me, ""Let it go""
You helped me realize I was bigger than just a street nigga

I understand them young niggas and
I understand y'all come from a certain life
But if you wanna go to that next level like
You gotta act like it
I ain't gon' lie, like that shit just go in one ear and out the other ear
'Cause I'm just from that culture homie
Like where I just don't see nobody protectin' me like me
These young niggas with me gon' die with me bruh, like
I'm a die with them and this understood so
I just always felt like that's that security, we our own security

You told me youngsta' a superstar but that nigga crazy
I introduced you to Bag, you say he's amazin'
We both done fucked up 'bout Snootie, we had a plan for him
We know he had his little issue but we were prayin' for him
I remember you called me excited, sayin' you had talked to Ye
I can't lie, I was geeked, I'm like, ""What he say?""

You was on some shit like, ""My guys, they wanna work with you""
I ain't even gonna front, like, you had told me all the Ye stories and shit
And we had been working together like probably a year and a half now like
I was like, ""Man, I don't really know if you fuck with Ye like that""
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm just bein' G
And you like, ""No for real, like he wanna work with you""
I'm like ""When?""
You're like, ""Tomorrow""

Like nigga sittin' way in the back

We was on a first thing smokin' nigga to LA
We're gonna work with Kanye
That shit was crazy
We walked into the studio and nigga was eatin' pot pie and chicken and shit
He was just a cool aired nigga like I just
Immediately screamin' and droppin' joint after joint, after joint, after joint
And I ain't give a fuck was it was gon' be on
If it was gon' be on anything, and it was just
I always wanted to work with Ye and you knew it
It was crazy

Now I told you I want to sign with Jay and you asked me why
You didn't really feel this shit but you was down to ride
Then we went up to the office you had a different view
And you were rushin' me to sign like the shit was you, crazy

See I always knew Minute was your man and shit 'cause you always talked about him, but
We met TaTa and Shaka there
You remember we sat down in the room with Jay?
And that nigga was just kickin' some real shit to us
We were holdin' out the pose on some G shit though
We see 'em G, you know what I'm sayin'?
We get money too, you feel me?
When we left the office we were like, ""Damn""
I mean, nigga was just amazed at like
Niggas that grew up together and built an empire together
And I was really motivated by that
That day I told you that was how I wanted me and my brothers to be and me and my niggas to be
And then we went to this little private party, remember that shit?
Jay got to them to pop the Ace in it, that shit spilled all on the table and shit
I remember you pulled me to the side
You were like, ""I've been in the game a long time, this is 
Like the very, very first time I've felt like an artist""
You were tellin' me like you felt like an artist, you were like, 
""Nigga I'll sign the contract right now if they break that motherfucker out""

Damn, if I knew talkin' to you was my last time
The other night it wouldn't have been about no CM9
I would have let you know I value your participation
And would have thanked you for your patience and your conversations
No you weren't forced to question God, and you were somewhere better
But we were supposed to get rich and gon' retire together, what happened?

I don't know
How can I go on?
Continue to stay strong
Continue to pray hard
Keep singing your name on
And we're gonna just record
It was many nights like this
When I could call you
And you could pick the phone up

You can see it in my eyes, that's pain
Lost niggas to the game, it ain't the same

And it matters to me to see you smiling
Why don't we blow all your cares away?

And today is where every new day starts
Got to be free like the leaves in Autumn
You may be sad but it never lasts

And maybe, by the evening we'll be laughing
Just wait and see all the changes there'll be
By the time it gets dark

We could go out walking out in the sunshine
Look at all the people out in the street
Hurrying away to their business functions
Waiting for a taxi for aching feet

Light up your face, baby
Let's get going
Wanna see a change in those weary eyes
We'll have some fun
Take a boat out rowing
Why ever should life so serious?

But it's so hard to say the words I feel
This fancy that I'm on, has been goin' on too long
It's time we stopped pretending things are real

'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been telling lies
And I don't know just what's right or wrong
To take a chance on losing you was such a silly thing to do
The chance I might wake up and find you gone

Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue
Any brighter flame would be a lie
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you
But I know that I'll only make you cry

A thief can only steal from you, he cannot break your heart
He'll never touch the precious things inside
So one like you should surely be miles and miles away from me
Then you'd never know how much I've lied

Have ceased to bring the smile from everyone
How tears have filled the eyes
Of friends that you once walked among

To a needle of death

Dissolved the blood spread quickly to your brain
In peace your mind withdraws
Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain

While to the earth your body's slowly cast
Your father stands in silence
Caressing every young dream of the past

To free his mind, to release his very soul
Has proved to all who live
That death itself is freedom for evermore

Growin up was crazy, in my days we got our ass kicked
Mama didn't play no ? cause talkin back is foul play
She had her own way of gettin across, which was a belt of steel
She'd tell us from the work we could all but kneel
Gettin nasty in front of guests was the way she'd like to do it
She'll say straighten your shit up, or you can stop em from comin
And yo guys knew what time it was, even they was checked
I got a down ass mama (""that's right"") mama don't take no mess
Now shit got hectic, cause mama was tipped
She'll tell you in a minute don't let your mouth get yo' ass whipped
Mama did it all by herself, King and Queen of this house
Yellin, ""I want my Daddy"" would get your ass thrown out
Now when it came to partyin, moms got wild

Checkin her dresser sayin, ""What happened to my money?""
If it was on then it was on, cause money don't walk
Somebody better talk, find the stuff she done lost
I got my butt whooped for everything I did wrong
And it was ON, cause niggaz kept playin on my phone
Don't let moms go to a conference and the teacher confess
Man I'm tell you, mama don't take no mess
Why watch me go down, fight to keep it goin
but really not knowin cause the truth is what they're showin
You don't have a friend, friends come and go is what she'll say
Never tell your deepest secret, you'll get hurt that way
Love is a game, and it's okay if you play
But they're dogs dressed as men, tryin to be your friend
and baby watch out, don't take a step unless you know which way you're goin
Times are gettin lonely but I'll be a honey
I'll never leave ya, believe that love is in the air
No matter what you done, moms'll be there

Girl, you're gettin played like a sucker
I know it's none of my business 
But what the hell is this?
Lettin a guy get the best of you?
But here we go, YoYo is to the rescue
Cause you see, I'm more than a softie
I'm here to open your eyes, so you can smell the coffee
Guys ain't nothin but dirt
And they'll flirt with anything dressed in a mini-skirt
You know your man's cheatin while you're sleepin
He's leavin your side to start creepin
But you pretend like you don't see the man
I heard love is blind - but damn..
You can read it in brailles and still tell without a bright light
That somethin ain't right
You kow that he's sleepin with this girl and that girl
I even saw your man with a fat girl
But you know, two can play at that game
He's got another on the side, do the same
Bein in love is cool (true)
But I'ma tell you like this: girl, don't be no fool

Hey Denise, girl, how you doin, how you - wait
Wait a minute -
Homegirl, what's up with the black eye?
(Ehm - I fell) Hah, now that's a damn lie
The man you got is just bad for your health
You can lie to me, but not to yourself
So when you gonna leave him?
(But he says that he loves me) Hah, and you believe him?
(Yeah) And then you let him sock you? (hm-hm)
And after he says I'm sorry you let him knock you?
Get rid of that sucker, girl, pick a winner
Instead of gettin beat by a chicken dinner
You ain't supposed to be hit (you're right)
And any man that hits a girl ain't shit
I'm tryin to tell you, but I thought you knew it
Cause right about now you're goin stupid for cupid
But cupid ain't the ones gettin knocked around
Socked around by a low-down clown from uptown
So what you're gonna do to the creep?
If I was you, I would wait until he fall asleep 
And I'd show him what time it is
Tie him down and his behind is mine
Show him he can get beat before you beat it
Tell him to treat you the way you want to be treated
If that don't work, break out of your door
But don't certainly let him hit you, girl, don't be no fool

(Yeah, the IBWC is like in here!
But YoYo got somethin else to say)

Nowadays I guess men just think they can take advantage of a woman
But that's when you have to come in and show the man
If he can't get none of you
You're just a woman just like he a man

Here's a message to the ladies
Married, single and even the ones with babies
Listen to YoYo once again
As I conversate about ways of men 
In your life, girl, keep an open mind
And you'll find a lie in each and every line
They say, ""Hah, sure we're from the new school""
What I'm tryin to say is, girl, don't be no fool

Today  how you like me now  I'm in the mix? 
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota 
Got the baking soda  let the water boil  workers all loyal 
Dropped out the twelve'th 
'cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees 
Now I slang keys 
Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack 
Take a nation of millions to hold me back 
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches 
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches 
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5 
'89s the number, another summer 
Police ain't get no dumber 
Streets dried up, used to think it would last 
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past 
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder 
Now I got my ass in Minnesota 
Got my own crew, it's on brand new

Already done stack me half a mill ticket 
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it 
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz 
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome 
Police are tappin' my mobile phone 
I'm almost home 
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it 
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest 
And everything I own got repossessed 
Now take a look at the dust 
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months 
Never picked up a book 
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look 
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew 
And see, what can I do? 

Today

Fucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo 
Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough 
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch 
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at 
Me say ain't nothin' poppin' from here to the LB 
What you tell me? 
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe 
'cause, they sent in the troops 
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle 
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle 
No skills to pay the bills 
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflation 
No college degree, just a dumb ass G

I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess

I like to flow so swift, its got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo its kinda soft and
If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right

Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, its a sad case
So who ya man dippin the dollars, what
Yup, for puttin lipstick on his collar

To keep it at a latest while they're yellin, ""more, more!""
I am very versatile, changin my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my backround
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel imperior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and disback all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think its time that we defeat
And stand on our on two feet
If we want to live wit justice and harmony

You see the n**** was so fat he couldn't fit in my car
But it's all love, I ain't trippin'
I just booted his a** and kept dippin', listen
(Lyte) Well now, me, myself, I like 'em tall slim and slender
Keepin' me warm with hot sex in the winter
Cause out the door, is like a freezer
In-a my house I keep 'em warm like a heater
(Yo Yo) Well... I like 'em nice and thick, with more dollars than sense
Don't need releationships, just true to this
I want a man that's taller, a shot-caller
Like a baller, instead of a yes-yes-why'aller

(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
(Lyte) Rain or shine, I'ma get mine without no delay
I keep 'em on reserve and take 'em off of the display
Treat him like a Doc', better believe he's on call
And when I hit him on the headpiece like yes-yes-why'all
(Yo Yo) I remember wakin' up with this cuties in bed
The last words he said was 'Don't forget to call me'
Damn, I shouldn't have did it, now I ain't with it
I hope he wasn't lookin' for a commitment, damn
(Lyte) I keeps it on the real, baby I moves slow
And if you ready to push in the bush then you gots to go
On the first date, brother you gots to wait
And it's worth your while, some say I'm the all time great
(Yo Yo) Well... I treat 'em like fleas on my collar
Pick 'em by the hour, cutie with big D's and dollars
Dressed in Versace or Polo, you never know
Question is, how low can you really go?

(Chorus)
(Yo Yo & MC Lyte)
One for the cutie, two for the cutie
Three for the cuties with the big D's and money
One for the cuite, two for the cutie with the big D...
One for the cutie, two for the...
Three for the... Oh yeah
One for the money, two for the cutie
And three for the cuties, and the money with the...
The everything, with everything that it takes, (Ha ha ha)
We need a cutie with big D and money",One for the Cuties,1996

Got me blowin' up your pager like I ain't doing it right
Gee, you must be crazy, however could you play me
Nothing-ass nigga till you made me your Lady
Now, what nigga, what nigga what
Whatever made you build up the gut
Now that you rollin' in a Lex-o on Dex-o's
Hittin' bitches into riches, hittin' mad switches
Wanna... front on your honey, that helped you get your money
You better come real, this ain't no crash test dummy

So tell your homies you can out with no curfew
Since I'm a bird, and now I'm rollin' with my girl crew

For all the years I let you lie with your secrets
Now that I'm single don't be stressin' who I sleep wit'

Waitin' to exhale like Angela Bassett
Though I won't be burning threads I'll be burning your assets
In the meantime, between lines, there will be no rewinds
You work your thing and I work mine
Needed affection, had me blinded by erection
But when nit-wit left, it had me take a right direction
You, silly softy, had my loft he's... 
Tried to boss me and floss me, when you crossed me you lost me
Thank you, for giving me the eyes to see
Well ain't you, the nigga that was dodging me
Ain't heard nothing he said, had his shit on mute
Now girls wasn't that cute (woah woah)

When you need it, you call hood-rats and critters
But when I want it I just call a babysitter

Instead of hanging with your real? you're lonely
You'd rather hang out with those fake homies that don't stay

You wanna kick game with Yo Yo?
(Woah woah)
I'm solo and I got combo
(Woah woah)
You think it's all talk, well oh no
(Yo Yo)
Well less of the flow, tell me mo'

The best pussy in the world
Why you wanna play me like you muber three girl?
It was all jolly good, with my knees back
But since you wanna front I want my motherfuckin keys back
It's been all sunny since your rainy ass left
I thought it would be hell, but now I see that I am blessed
Mamma told me that I would go through this test
No more wet for you, you can't get on my breasts, so

Smooth like a baby's ass, the kinda funk that make Lo-Lo's crass
Smash up the street, stash on my heat
Ridin' in my hood deep bumpin' battlecat's beats
I'm on a regular, all on my celular phone

I puffed a bag of fume as soon as I landed
I'm runnin' late why don't you meet me at my condo
I'm rollin' down Venice on my way to Riando
You know the place where everybody kick it
I'm skatin' all day, it's got the roofs vibrating
The party don't start till I walk in
Everybody 'bout, Yo where you been?
Hell' in my busines hush your mouth
And get your feet up off my couch, check it out

Ain't no party like a Yo Yo party
The gin is free, the hennesay is everybody
You wanna hit it, c'mon now admit it
I know you're wit' it, don't stop, get it, get it

I only got your beeper number so you think I'm frontin'
But I know your kind, play me like a Honda
You know it's Yo, but you callin' me Yolanda

You want some Brandy ""How can I be down?"" shit
'Cause you's small time, wanna see the queen rise
Get between my thighs, cause I got the green eyes
So c'mon, and do what you feel
Got the brew on chill, with the sex on the grill
I see the women they be swimmin' in my pool
Enough to make you drool, but slow down fool

Only God knows how we'll all end up
Get so corrupt, we can't give up, we got to keep on pushing
(Keep on pushing, ain't no stopping us)
Ain't no stopping us

A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the righteous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot

Where do I go from here, I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my past, the life I knew, the life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled over seas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concock the scheme
To play upon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears
So ah, where do I go from here, I don't know
I don't know, till I find my past, the life I knew

All in the game a young female, so intelligent 
And deep like seashells, uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt
Plus interact with the black folks
And blowin' smoke ain't never been a problem
It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster, you know
Let you boost like I'm suppose ta

Yo-Yo,"Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...

First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

But you don't know how funky that I can get

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Man women I put a lot of fear in em
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

Yeah so what's the problem

Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

Yeah I admit you can flow

Well that's true

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

Yeah I can see you got it good

Oh that I know

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

So what up then

Girl what you tryin to do

To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Or a big butt...",It's a Man's World,1997

But you got to put me down soon I flip a sideshow
If you come my way up down and around even sideways

And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo it's kinda soft and
If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother)

What's yo name baby?

That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but know I'm not a dunkin
As I rap, chilly chill bringin the funk and
I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk and
He'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin
I may be buttercup, or even 
We had dinner, and know we drinkin Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's gettin cosy
Your home alone, so now you gettin nosy
Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, it's a sad case
So who ya man dippin the dollars, what
Yup, for puttin lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla
But he'll slap ya, and sock ya, so why bother?

But if you come knockin at my do'(ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell em Ice

Fool, 1990 and stand sucka free, yeah
Tell em what's up

Yo, I hope you realize one day
That ya week is Monday threw Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, heres my bio
And next to me, ha, your not fly yo
Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts
Yo-Yo, is just tryna to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not livin like that first
Although I pack, a real small gat in my purse(right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on the structions
Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O
Yo, should I tell em Ice

The simple to a methaphor, make someone to yell on
To keep it at a latest while they're yellin, ""more, more!""
I am very versatile, changin my ways to diffrent styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my backround
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel imperior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and disback all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat
And stand on our on two feet

I've been looking for

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell me your name
Please tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)

Ain't never seen nothin' as sweet as you
(I wanna know your name)
Sitting there in that gray dress, pretty little thing
(I wanna know your name)

'Cause I never believed
In love at first sight
But now I know
That it's alright

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Please tell me your name
What's your name
(I wanna know your name)

You look so good, you look so good
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, ain't never seen nothing like this in my life
(I wanna know your name)
You just look like something I could settle down with

Let me introduce myself, my name is Little Sonny
I drive a little red Volkswagen
I like to go horse back riding
I like all kind of sweets, cupcakes, currants and things like that

This is why I can't help from noticing you
Just a jazzy, jazzy ol' babe
Come on, can I have this dance
Something as groovy as this, we got to dance

Lord, have mercy
Am I holding you too tight'
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me
Ain't gonna get too close

When are you going to tell me your name'
Please tell me your name
I'm just going to have to grab you
And hold you a little closer
'Cause, I just got to, Lord, have mercy

(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just hold me, just squeeze me

(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name, you sweet little thing, you
(I wanna know your name)
I could love you, I could love you, I could love you
All night long, all night long, all night long

Listen, what about giving your phone number
And I call you one Saturday afternoon
Perhaps we can go in town, have a little bite to eat
And then maybe, go and take a movie

And afterwards, I'll just drop you at the, at the doorstep
And give you little kiss
Oh, I just, there's so many things
That we could do if you just tell me your name
I am not even married, are you married'

Girl, you gotta tell me, tell me, tell me your name
Just wait a minute, don't leave out the door
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Just tell, just tell girl
Just wait a minute",Boogie Oogie Oogie,2005
Yo-Yo,"Verse 1

Mack 10 nutty as they come 
leave 'em face down
and numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
rollin' down a one way
in my 'lac front and back
over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
it get's on my nerves
banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Chorus

Foe life foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
(Repeat)

Verse 2

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
with my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
a lot of stiches in the ass
blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go
and if he say no I'ma have to say
bitch get out the car slow
and leave ya fuckin' dough
'cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Chorus

Verse 3

Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
my momma want to know why I do what I do
'cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
with no serial number it's the summer
where niggas die
It's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
and try to guess the color of my shoelaces

Yo-Yo Ma,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night,1992
Yo-Yo Ma,"Times have changed
And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(if any brains you've got)
From those little radios

With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmon's
Cause Franklin knows

Yo-Yo Ma,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1992
Yo-Yo Ma,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1992

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Guarding thy dreams from all terror and fear,

Sweet visions attend thy sleep,
Fondest, dearest to me,
While others their revels keep,
I will watch over thee.

The wandering dews by the flow'rs are caressed,

Brings to the world the glad tidings of day;
Fill the dark void with thy dreamy delight--
Slumber, thy mother will guard thee tonight,
Thy pillow shall sacred be
From all outward alarms;
Thou, thou are the world to me
In thine innocent charms.

I don't know how you were inverted

Yo-Yo Ma,"New York tendaberry, blue berry
A rush on rum, of brush and drum
And the past is a blue note, inside me
I ran away in the morning

New York tendaberry, blue berry
Rugs and drapes and drugs and capes
Sweet kids in hunger slums

Firecrackers break and they cross
And they dust and they skate
And the night comes

I ran away in the morning
Now I'm back, unpacked

Sidewalk and pigeon
You look like a city
But you feel like religion to me

New York tendabery, true berry
I lost my eyes, In east wind skies
Here where I've cried, where I've tried
Where God and the tendaberry rise

Where quakers and revolutionaries
Join for life, for precious years
Join for life, through silver tears

Yo2Go,"I don't know much but I know what I feel
There's too many people fighting, tied to the wheel
I don't know much but I know what I see
There's too many people crying washed out to sea

And there's much more we can say
And there's much more we can do
And there's much more we can learn
Generations of love

I don't know you but you know what I am
Hey, I don't need redemption or no government plan
No big AIDS sensation no 28 clause
The end of apartheid, no message of war

The Jew and the Gentile, the back and the gay
The lost and the futile, they've all got something to say
The African nation, the sword of Islam
The rebels in China, the Sikhs and the Tams

The house of our Father, the volumes of guilt
The luck of the Irish, the blood that we've spilt
The angels and martyrs, the lovers and saints
The sisters of mercy, the brothers of pain

And the band is really happening
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the angel of compassion
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops

And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime

And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left

I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
And I know it must have hurt you,
It must have hurt your pride
To have to stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
And me I'm up there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come

You wouldn't like it here

It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
Ah but some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come

Ah baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Yeah let's do something crazy,
Something absolutely wrong

When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting

When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain,
And they ask you how you're doing
Of course you'll say you can't complain
If you're squeezed for information,
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting

I'm lost; I can't tell where you end and I begin

That God blessed the broken road

Wouldn't change a thing
Man, it feels like Heaven underneath my feet

So you take the left, I'll take the right
Under arrest, we're under fire
Oh oh oh oh
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in
You take the low, I'll take the high
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet
Everybody got a problem with the way I live
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in

So raise 'em up, raise 'em up
All I ever wanted was a shot at your love
I know, and I believe
Everything we got is everything we need
Oh, love will get you higher
I set my heart on fire
I know, it's what you see
Don't wanna go to Heaven if they don't want me

'Cause I'm no criminal
I'm not your enemy
All I have is life
And I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in

So you take the left, I'll take the right
Under arrest, we're under fire
Oh oh oh oh
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in
You take the low, I'll take the high
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet
Everybody got a problem with the way I live
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in

Oh, yeah, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Everything you wanted is inside your cup
Drink up
Love will get you higher
Oh, oh, all that your rhythm needs
I never met no criminal
And in the end I'll do it again
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in

Oh, I'm not a criminal
Yeah, I'm no enemy
It's just the way I live
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in",Heaven,2014
Yoga Pop Ups,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
The corner bar. It just seemed right so I pulled up.
Not a soul around but the old bar keep 
Down at the end lookin' half asleep 
But he walked up and said, what'll it be? 
I said the good stuff. 
He didn't reach around for the whiskey. 
He didn't pour me a beer. 
His blue eyes kinda went misty. 
He said you can't find that here.

[Chorus]
'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date.
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much
And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair. 
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year 
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff.

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass. 
And I smiled and said I'll have some of that. 
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends. 
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare. 
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed. 
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me. 
But I've been sober three years now 
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls 
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl 
Married his high school love.
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa.
Bein' right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up
Yeah man that's the good stuff.

He said, when you get home she'll start to cry. 
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I. 
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up 
'Cause that's the good stuff.

That's the good stuff.",The Good Stuff,2017

Hey yo Yogi, why don't you come with that shit homey

Wake up in the morning, shit what are you kidding me
My mom's a bitch, she don't feel like hearing me
I gotta take a leak so I put on my house slippers
Gotta shave my dome so I grab my clippers
It's sunny as usual, another day to put it down
And all the dust settled in my town
I got happy when my dog got out
I had to run him down about who was shot out
I pumped down the mix and why I got out
I gotta make this money man, that's what it's about
So from the East County to the South Bay
To my posses on Broadway, it's Dago and problemas
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
I got riders in the storm and the outskirt
It ain't nothing but a word from the mero mero
Ain't you Yogi? I see you heard my demo

Gotta make some phone calls to see what's up for tonight
Gotta find something fresh for me to sport for tonight
So I shoot to the mall, I hear my name being called
'Cause everytime that I go I see somebody that I know
My pager's blowing up so I gots to use the phone
It's the homeboy from Low Pro talking about a party in the zone
And Royal gots some hynas that wanna kick it with us
But more than likely dog we're going to the club
I gotta get creased up before the homies pick me up
I gotta get hectic so I'm pumping the homies up
Now we're South of the border, straight thugs and hoochie mamas
We use a broken bottle when we meet some drama
And it's guaranteed, so won't see the baby's mama
And the DJ keep on spinning and the spot be getting hotter
And me and my homies torn the club down because we're fools
And yeah yeah, We Be Clubbing like Ice Cube

We gonna do what we do mami

I bump beats and write raps trying to make mula stacks
Got all the homeboys asking where the hynas at
We flipping you-eys for hoochies, I'm watching you jock
As I shoot through the zone, old school hard drop
Chicks scream out the window like they're long shot
As I lean to they side they throw the bone eye
You see I'm not a player I just crush a lot
You see I'm not a gangster but I'll rush your spot
I be knowing about them broads that talk a lot
So we pull over and post up at the taco shop
Hey yo Yogi Bear be buzzing off that bacardi hard
I'm thinking to myself dog we gotta make it pop
So while these chicks be jocking us we tell them follow us
Back to the spot 'cause we bound to rock

Yogi Yorgesson,"Oh I yust go nuts at christmas
On that yolly holiday
I'll go in the red like a knucklehead
Cause I'll squander all my pay
Oh I yust go nuts at Christmas
Shopping sheer drives me berserk
On the day before I rush in a store
Like a perviveval yerk
I'll look at nightgowns for my wife
Those black ones trimmed in red
But I won't know her size and so she'll get a carpet sveeper instead
Oh I yust go nuts at Christmas
When each kid hangs up his sock
It's a time for kids to flip their lids
While their papa goes in hawk
On the night before Christmas it's still in the house
My family is sleeping so I'm quiet like a mouse
I look at my watch and midnight is near
I think I'll sneak out for a cold glass of beer
Down at the corner the crowd is so merry
I end up drinking about 12 Tom and yerry
I get to bed late gee vis how I'm sleeping
When onto my bed those darn kids they come leaping
They sit on my face and they yump on my belly
And I'm quivering all over like a bowl full of yelly
They scream Merry Christmas and my poor wife and me
We stumble downstairs and she lights up the tree
My head is exploding my mouth tastes like a pickle
I step on a skate and fall on a tricycle
Just before Christmas dinner I relax to a point
Then relatives start swarming all over the yoint
On Christmas I hug and I kiss my wife's mother
The rest of the year we don't speak to each other
After dinner my aunt and my wife's uncle Louie
Get into an argument their both awful screwy
Then all my wife's family say Louie is right
And my goofy relations they yoin in the fight
Back in the corner the radios playing
And over the racket Gabriel heater is saying
Peace on earth everybody and good will towards men
And yust at that moment someone slugs Uncle Ben
They all run outsides whooping so the neighbors will hear
Oh I'm so glad merry Christmas comes yust once a year
Oh I yust go nuts at Christmas but I still have lots of fun
Yust the same as you I enjoy it too
Merry Christmas Everyone",I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas,1990

Derrière tes sourires aussi sur

Arrête avec tes faux complexes
Tu ne t'occupes que de ton corps
Tu rappelles tous tes ex pour trouver du réconfort
Chérie arrête ton baratin
Tes faux caprices, tes faux chagrins
C'est toujours le même thème je te hais comme je t'aime

je ne veux plus d'un mec qui rentre tard
Et qui me harcèle quand je pars
Pourquoi tu roules des mécaniques
Chaque fois que je m'en vais tu paniques
Tu t'énerves pour que je revienne
C'est toujours le même thème je te hais comme je t'aime

Love me love me love me
Après quoi on court
Love me love me love me
Un peu plus tous les jours

Après quoi on court
Je t'aime un peu plus tous les jours

Love me love me love me
Après quoi on court
Love me love me love me
Un peu plus tous les jours",Love Me,2013
Yohanna,"You say you really know me
you’re not afraid to show me
what is in your eyes
So tell me about the rumors
Are they only rumors?
Are they only lies?
Falling out of a perfect dream, coming out of the blue
Is it true?
Is it over?
Did I throw it away?
Was it you?
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?
If you really knew me
You couldn’t do this to me
You would be my friend
If one of us is lying
There’s no use in trying

No need to pretend
Falling out of a perfect dream, coming out of the blue
Is it true?
Is it over?
Did I throw it away?
Was it you?
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?

Yohe & The Tribal Wad Wiseis,"There's something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Telling me I got to beware 

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away 

We better stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, now, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, children, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down",For What It's Worth,2003
Yoji,"ほら少しずつあなたの残した
温もりが溶けだして
全部消えたらこんな体は
何の意味をもつかな
衝動が重なり合って
出口のない迷路にはまる
ふいに襲う現実達が
抜け出せる道を探す
なのに何故不思議なくらい
この場所を離れられない
明日の今頃にはうまく笑える
そうまるで何事も
なかったかのように
いつだってそうやって
歩いて来たのに
このゲーム思うように操作できない

もし何か口にすれば
その瞬間すべてはただ
砂のように指の隙間
すり抜けてしまいそうで
時間だけ呆れるくらい
平然と過ぎるのを待つ
明日の今頃には忘れてるような
その場しのぎの言葉なんていらない
いつもより少し長引かせすぎたの
大丈夫ゲームならまた探せばいい

Save your tears
For the day
When our pain is far behind
On your feet
Come with me
We are soldiers stand or die
Save your fears
Take your place
Save them for the judgement day
Fast and free
Follow me
Time to make the sacrifice
We rise or fall 

[note TV size ends here]
I'm a soldier, born to stand
In this waking hell I am
Witnessing more than I can compute
Pray myself we don't forget
Lies, betrayed and the oppressed
Please give me the strength to be the truth
People facing the fire together 
If we don't, we'll lose all we have found
Save your tears
For the day
When our pain is far behind
On your feet
Come with me
We are soldiers stand or die
Save your fears
Take your place
Save them for the judgement day
Fast and free
Follow me
Time to make the sacrifice

Yoko Miyao,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1999
