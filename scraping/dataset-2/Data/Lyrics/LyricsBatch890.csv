",Hold That Thought,2004
B.G.,"I was born 1980 September 3rd
That's the day checks come out and vics gets served
So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain
My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game
They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood
I was raised on the block my mom did what she could
Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo
But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin dough
I made be	's n see's up in to 5th grade
It went to d's n f's 'cause I didn't want to behave
I was the class clown Christopher raise hair
I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled
Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside
I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time
The police spotted me id break out and run
Make em run behind me that was my way of having fun
Somewhere in 87 might of been 88
I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way
They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh*
IÂ´m a cut this boy short 'cause my moms was involved

You can put it together it was what it wasn't
Nah cakes to be baked but she had cakes in the owen
She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up
If I knew what I know now I would of took it n cut it up
92 roll round that's when it got real
My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed
Cash Money Records was started that same year
That's when my thuggin started I was gettin it how I live
My moma needed help I was outta control
The streets took me under I was on a dead end row
The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up
Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history

In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne
That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha
Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
That's when nigga decided to not keep it real
I had a idea I didn't want to believe it
I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy
I had a dope habbit and markie was on my back
So he turned his back but look how I shookback
You know how it go you get up when you fall
The streets all over they rooted for the underdog
I got Kizzle I got Snipe I got Gar on my team
And I got click of niggas ready for war on my team
From Detroit to Atlanta Texas and Nashville
Play if you want and you see how the gat feel
That was all in my past L.T. dog I miss ya

When I tell you I'ma G, pimp I'm really bein' modest
I could tell bout the dope boys, hoes, and the ballers (ho)
The pimps and the macks, real niggas that what they call us
Hangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us
Put 30's on a Lac to a Benz on brawlers
Standin' on the corner, slagin' crack and stackin' dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer
I ain't never had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')
Tryin' ta get a meal for my sons and my daughter
If I call a bad bitch wit connects down in Florida
Say her daddy and her uncle still getting cross the wall
??? I'd be a motherfuckin' fool if I don't call her

Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (hey what it do)
I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)

I'm runnin' Choppa City an fuckin' with Grand Hustle

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there
Or you can hear it from these niggas who was hardly there
Or take it from niggas who fought to make it a star to get here
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shutin' down when the don appear

[Chorus]",What They Do,2004
B.G.,"(David Banner talking)
I wish I had my pistol.
Miggas, think the south is a fad nigga.
I went back and picked up my nigga B.G.
We gon crank this mug.
Soutside motherfucker!!!!

Chorus
Bloody War! Bloody, bloody war!
What you think these bullets and all these guns made for? (made for)
Bloody War! Bloody, bloody war! (war)
What you think these bullets and all these guns made for?
(B.G.)
They made to bust with em (bust wit em,) they made to bang with em (bang with em,)
If you trippin, they made to knock out your brains with em.
They made to bust with em (bust wit em,) they made to bang with em (bang with em,)
If you trippin, they made to knock out your brains with em.

Verse 1
(David Banner)
I'm hittin you bitches,
With choppas, running from helicopters and duckin the feds,
Thirsting for blood, ready for war, I'm wanting you dead.
I want that nigga to come that shit, so I can get it back and go beat that bitch.
Teach that snitch, about that south; the place where we woulda putta bullet in your mouth.
Take your doe, take your cash, and let the grim reaper come and take your ass,
Imma slow it down cause I'm goin to fast, Imma slow it down to fast.
This the last time that I'm gonna remind you niggas, Imma cock back and put a hot dime in you niggas.
That's ten shots, ten pops from a fucking glock, I wanted peace, but now my piece is clearing out the block.
Knock, Knock. Who is it? Bitch, call me David Ban.
The man with a plan to put your ass in some land.
Bitch!!!

Chorus

Verse 2
(B.G.)
Nigga, where I'm from,
All we do is kill and hustle,
If you come slippin without that pistol, you in trouble.
I'd insult niggas, on a block that got they're stash took,
The niggas who took it turned around and got his ass busted.
I'm out here, half the time I don't sleep.
How Imma sleep when I'm in the streets and I got beef.
On my block it's war; we live like we in Pakistan,
I got the mac in my pants, and I got crack in my hands.
I give it how you want it; I take it how it come.
They say you live by the gun, and you die by the gun
I been a little soldier; I been a little beast.
I'm even wilder, I got Soldier Slim livin through me.

Chorus

Verse 3
(David Banner)
When I pray, I don't know what to say.
Just beg to the Lord to let me see another day.
A AK totter, 1st quarter, 50 through *****
Sweat on my palms, bomb ass weedwill keep me calm.
Strap on my arm, the streets is feeling like Vietnam,
Murdering Uncle Toms, I'm crunk like I'm Lil' John
Imma wizard waving a wand, your bodies up in my palm
If you kill me flex, hit the block and go take care of my moms nigga.
(B.G.)
My mom ashamed of me, I'm in the game now.
I tell her momma don't trip, it's too late to change now.
I'm on the block with it, I'm in the club with it.
Wherever you catch me at I'm ready to bust with it.

If you don't want your ol lady to get fucked don't bring her around me
Man, I'm hotter than you ever will be
Dawg I'm realer, just cooler, so smoother than you ever could be
I always put the hood in my rap
Cause I ride through the trap, no strap, hoe face in my lap
I'm a man I be holdin my own
Disrespect me if you want and I could promise you a whole in ya dome
I'm off the block when they play for keeps
And I was taught don't ride wit a nigga who ain't solid wit me
You got somethin to say then say it to me
Don't talk behind my back, be a man homie brang it to me
Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up
Please, stop hatin, start paper chasin and get ya game up

[Chorus: B.G]

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Look, I went from broke to rich
Rich to back do'
Broke then back to gettin 20 thousand a show
I went from weed to dope
Dope to speed ballin'
Cleaned myself for me I'm a fuckin moneyholic
Hoes just love how I carry myself
I look in the mirror sometimes and wanna marry myself
I be lookin when a nine got this swag to myself
Most of it came from my daddy, a lil' Slim left
I'm a fool from the UPT
When I ask Hot Girls, What it do
They say do it to me
I'm official anywhere on the globe
I could travel around the world in 30 days with 30 different hoes
Man, I'm back and I'm outta control
Man, I'm floodin the bank until they see they can't hold no mo'
Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up
Please, stop hatin, start paper chasin and get ya game up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: B.G.]
I ain't a mobbster, but Gizzle is made
I'm a tell ya, real niggas respect the game
Bustas feel played
Real niggas can go in hood
Cause real niggas do what they want, bustas do what they could
On the real, I'm like the law of the streets
I could pull up, hop out, and leave my keys in the car on the streets
Nigga know what come behind fuckin wit me
Mo' murder, mo' kill, mo' headbussin' fuckin wit me
So I advise you to stay on your level
Niggas stay in your place
Be smart just stay out the way
Dawg, just stay in your league
Cause its a lot of lions, tigers, and bears
Runnin through these trees
And believe, I'm the king of the jungle
I'm the coach of the team
I can't mess wit the scope and a beam
Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up
Please, stop hatin', start paper chasin' and get ya game up

Cut the music please
Oh no, no, oh no, no, oh no, no

I play the bulls*** from the backseat champ
Yea I'm in the backseat still got the seat back
Feet back stay from where the fake be at
N****s snitch for the shine where the patience at
N**** make his own brother face his back
Give love and take it back
Good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats
Face the facts you can't change him can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him if he kill you then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save ya
Me I come out of that water like I was just bathing
And watch my step on a wet pavement
Yea I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take 'em
Hollygrove Hollygrove was his last statement
So n**** get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me w-e-e crooked letter ""Y"" I'm so high
I skeet skeet in any n**** dime like she's mine
Street sweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in ya speakers from the chopper blast
Like, ha ha
That's bullet holes in your sneakers got you hopping back
It all stop when they hit you in ya top and back
No c***ing back silly motherf***er you ain't heard bout this
The clips ain't down to the dick
That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you b****es from by me
When I hit every piece of ya visible body he leakin'
Mortimer is no longer leapin' he sleepin'
While you p**** n****s is sleeping he thinking
Deep in thought the boy ain't even winkin'
Bob Marley got me stinking
Stacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins from where I came
Though I bear a name only one call live with
Coach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it
I'm sicker with it
Pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo' about dough
Nothing! man the four wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank-top pocket fan
No pocket knife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat boom!
Ha ha tonight I might just boost my feature price
Cause to each its own and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house big momma's house
She told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out
And he ain't getting up after them shots

Your mouth is heavy but your back ain't strong, and once again it's on
You must be smokin' on that cheech and chong
Think you can handle with somethin' this wrong, with somethin' this wrong
Just write it in blood, or carve it in stone
Otherwise you don't want no problems with homes, don't want no problems with homes
You can't get rid of me, not even penitentiary
A friend of me, you need to be, I'm hotter than humidity
Without a mask, jack a nigga for his cash
Hot led make a motherfucker heart beat fast

What's your heart beatin' for? (you scared)
What's your heart beatin' for, ha?",Where da At,2005
B.G.,"[Chorus]
Trill is when you're hustlin', trill is when you're grindin'
Trill is when you punch in that clock overtimin'
Trill is when you keep it real one hundred percent
And hold it down for your team run your game full sprint
Trill is when you never fake, trill is when you real
Chasin' after dollar bills, gotta get it how you live
Trill is when you hustle so you go out there and get it
Doin' whatever you gotta do to make a meal ticket

Yeah, I'm all about the cheese baby, all about the cheddar
When it come to ghetto grindin' can't nobody do it better
A real go-getter, never hesitate to hit a lick
I don't have to even make a phone cal to get a brick
Ya find lieutenant on ya Sidewalk Two
At code fo'-twenty-'fo, he know just what to do
Bring me two turkeys back like it's Thanksgiving
That's how we do in Texas my nigga, so how you livin'
Up in the game since the early 90's
Never sleep to keep them haters one step behind me
Ain't nothin' changed but the time that they hand out
But even without the cars and the ice, we stand out
Cause everybody know us in the streets, we like royalty
Commandin' respect and demandin' click loyalty
If you ain't down with freein' Pimp C then fuck all y'all
You wanna know what trill is? Tell 'em Paul Wall

[Chorus]

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I live by the code
In the city where greed and envy make ya heart turn cold
At 17 years old I was ahead of my time
I had to roll with the punches and keep my ducks in a line
I keep my mind on my money, I keep my mind on my paper
I keep a glock inside my pocket for all these jealous haters
I trained for chess moves, I'm five steaps ahead
I keep my mind focused, make money, break bread
I'm rollin' 5 9, it's the home of the crack sales
That South Lee block got more cookies than Snackwells
I snatch you up like eatin shrimp, don't contest do not attempt
You crossed the line no turnin' back, we'll leave you naked like Larry Flynt
With young ghetto stars, certified with ghetto scars
Intoxicated by weed cigars, we eat stress by sippin' barre
Fancy cars and diamond ice, I'm intrigued by fancy things
We always keep it trill, in the hood we look like kings

[Chorus]

Look, look, if you know me then you know I'm a G
If you know me then you know I'm gon' run through a hundred bricks a week
If you know me then you know I'm a dawg
If you know me then you know I get a package and I fly 'til it's gone
If you know me then you know I'm a fool
If you know me then you know I'll punish you if you fuck with the dude
If you know me then you know I'm a man
If you know me then you know I keep a plan to keep some money in my hand
If you know me then you know I'll bleed
You don't know me ask somebody they'll tell you wodie mean what he said
If I huff it, ain't no doubt I'm a spread
I'm a cock and bust, since 13 I been droppin' my nuts
I'm online for new artists in Florida
Got a bitch that'll drive with a package from Atlanta to Dallas
You ain't know, better ask your bitch
Paul Wall, Bun B, B.G. is as trill as it get

They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?
And them niggaz talking 'bout they ""trill niggas""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talking 'bout? this comin' from the o.g. style trill
Know what I'm talking 'bout? not these ol' fake ass niggas
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talking 'bout?
So this is what is, we bringin' georgia and Texas together
All you ol' bitch ass niggas that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'pac say

[Chorus II]

[Pimp see - talking after song ends]
Say what it do? Young Pimp see know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some ""king"" shit, know what I'm sayin'?
On the cool why'know.. young nigga T.I. jumped out there
Said he was the king of the south
He ruffled a whole lotta niggaz' feathers
But niggaz didn't really understand what the nigga was talkin 'bout
Why'know.. and uh.. so everybody had it twisted but..
Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggaz' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggaz shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggaz' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggaz out here
Talkin 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
'Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
And them niggaz talkin 'bout they ""trill niggaz""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggaz
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggaz flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP!! And, and, and, and move around for the South
'Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Now let's do this shit!",I'm Straight,2006

It ain't easy livin where the young die fast (fast)

And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

Hey boy you know it when you see it
Them G's on deck
Them bitches at attention when the kings on set
Nigga come in with that flex and jump up out and get checked
It ain't no disrespectin' when the king on set
40 cal in a tech fuck around and get wet
You better hit the deck when the king on set
Hey hey we got them G's on deck
Hey and hit the deck when the king on set

Slap a slug on me mac 11 in the bubble coat
I'm chillin' with the homie what the fuck you startin' trouble fo'
Hey first you tried to tell em homie hatas ay what you lookin' fo'
Cause once we start to let em go yo ass they gon' be lookin' fo'
Don't know what he took us fo'
Never been a pussy so I don't know what they yellin' 
Screamin' fussin' cause he pushin' fo'
I ain't fen to talk let em walk like it's all good
Catch him slippin in the parkin lot and then it's all good
Got a couple blocks and a mask in the glove box
He come out the club and his ass get seen
Now I'm linked out the window with the beam on set
Made up my mind I'm a kill him when I see him no sweat
Make a bet I ain't gon put his monkey ass on a shelf
And I don't need nobody help cause I can do this shit myself
In a triple black Chevy ride low key step
I hope this nigga ready cause he gon see death

[Chorus]

Now these niggas better move when the G's comin' through
Never be afraid to shoot when you see them near you
All fellas in my crew ain't no tellin' in my crew

I'm a veteran in the crew livin' legend in the crew
I keep that desert eagle lethal weapon plus two
We goin' beef what it do
And you know that I'm a ride
We can do it right here or we can take it outside
Every day is homicide couple of bodies every night
We got half the population murder rate still rise
Ay bullets still fly write his name on the wall
I ain't even gotta do it I got goons on call
I'm a beast I'm a dog you a bitch you a fraud
I'm a ride I'm a G you a snitch you a fraud
If you want it you can get it hit him all up in his neck
And his head and his chest make sure that nigga wet deck

Ya boy big daddy long stokes and I come to tell
Ya'll about my nigga the one and the only the
B.G. holla at peace



",Intro,2007
B.G. AKA B. Gizzle,"Look, I'ma get in the game you heard me
Women, over here come listen, tell em
If you ain't been with a nigga, its too late
In the game, for a nigga to be making a bitch feel lead
You'll want to get it right, and when you get it right
You'll want to keep it right, look
A real nigga is hard to come by, believe it

Girl I can't believe you, how you gone
Turn around and bite the hand that feeds you
The way I break my back, good as I treat you
I keep saying this, I'ma really have to seat you
I'd hate to see the outcome, if I leave you
But its cause I want to be, its not because I need you
You don't want to be careful, why should I try to keep you
Nigga gon fuck, then he gone in a week or two
Them same hoes you be repping' to, believe it or not, the same hoes
Behind your back, run and tell me, each and everything you do
You better wake up, and pay attention
Realize your partners want to ask you out, to get to your position
I guarantee they got they man cuffed, if he say no that mean no
They can't go there, ain't gonna' huff and puff
That's a done deal, you better keep it real
You better, realize who pay your bills

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough
Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gonna' make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gonna' fuck around
And leave this bitch in handcuffs

Now see this is what I'm talking bout, you out here running round
With them knuckle head, fucking give head hoes
Bring em to your house, then walk around in they bad clothes
You sneaking to the club with em, when I be on the map, that's cold
But its cool, cause my mama never raised no fool
We was in school, you had a nigga when I played on you
I should've seen it, but I was too caught up on the grind
In the blind, you knew I stayed with other shit on my mind
But all it did was take time, to show me the light
No I can't put this one behind, so you can go head and kite
So tell them hoes that there, and see what they say
They can't fuck you, but I can knock them off any day
So get your hand out my face, 'fore I bat you in yours
You should of, stayed in your place now the tables done turned
And everything I gave you, bitch I struggled to earn
Get your purse you gotta skate, you lucky you don't get burned

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough
Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gonna' make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gonna' fuck around
And leave this bitch in handcuffs

Girl don't play dumb, you know who made you
Everything you want you get, everything you got I gave you
I took you from hard times and saved you
In the best of everything I laced you
Made it where no one could fade you, sometimes I hate you
I love you to death, but the way you act
I know that's not the way, that Lil B. Gizzle raised you
I'm on the verge, about to shake you, don't forget
I'm a paid nigga getting sick of you trying to be slicker
Tripping, trying to build fake cases, a house
Your clothes, your feature and supplied transportation
And that's how you gonna' do a nigga, mentally abuse a nigga
You gonna' regret trying to use a nigga, you this close from bout to lose this nigga
Man they got hoes all over the world, that wish they knew this nigga
See one time threw with you, I'm threw with you
Ain't nothing that I could do with you, but try to be cool with you

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough
Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gonna' make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gonna' fuck around
And leave this bitch in handcuffs

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up

I know you know of me, Sniper playa baby
I hold it down full of Mo' and Crown, it make the kid move
Quick, too much Vodka make me nervous bad
I'm popping bottles every hour, making Erkles mad
I left the scene, swerved past in a purple Jag
You heard of trap, ladies love me you perverted fags
I rock the house like it's church, yeah I love the Lord
Play with my team, Chopper City it's goin' be murder mass you heard me
Know you love the way that gangstas play it, we drank and blazing
Till ancient ages, this ain't for babies
So ease your nerves, play your girl like she easing surf
Cause chill what's beneath my shirt, have you bleeding syrup
I ain't tripping if you need that work, Sniper pull up in a Viper
With a rifle, that'll mean your smirk
Flows make my people lean, and twerk
I hit the track and beat it up like Ike and Tina Turner, it's Chopper City man

[Chorus: x2]

[Hakim]
Now why yall already know, Uptown in here
I got my seventeen rounds in ya, we blowing pounds in ya
And you know, where I'm found in here
Last week they had a body, left found in here
And with the drank getting smoked, the bottles is popping
We ain't even make it to the party, and girls jocking
It's Hakizzle, you know the name girl
Just write your number down, and I'll give you a ring girl
I don't mean, to snatch your chicks player
But the bar need chips player, look at my wrist player
The hood call me, Young Neno
Cause I'm quick to snatch your senorita, or hit the block with a kilo
Calm down homeboy, you messing up my groove
Yeah iight you smoking, give me a cool
We stunt round year, ride in convertibles
Them Chopper City dudes'll murder you, holla back Kizzle

Me and my click at the scene, straight tearing it down
Ball till we fall, believe we laying it down
The party off the hook, when Chopper City arrive
Thugging popping bottles, until the sun rise
It's going down, it's going dizzle, it's going diggity
We from Uptown, off the hizzle off the higgity
I know you feeling me fa shiggity, Baby Gizzle
Baby Geezie, Baby Gangsta popping pistols

With me, I won't miss you I got the pistol
Hoes jocking niggas hating, can't take us
Can't fade us, we ball just like the Lakers

Tearing the roof off, the party jumping hard

Wassup man
Look, this for my people
You heard me my dog
Man I miss my dog
My dog know I miss him to
But I feel it man
I feel them all in my heart
I know you right here, right with me
Man just riding on with his niggas
You heard me, I miss a lot of people
They know I miss them to
Look

[Verse One]
Nigga took care for my heart
When they killed my dog
Ruined every last dream that we had to ball
Me and this nigga was like brothers
Since we was small
I needed anything he was the first I'd call
He was down the road with me
If I got in beef
By fucking them hoes with me
He was H-O-T
Kept it real and representing
Via-13 got a little girl
I treat like it's for me
and a lot of hoes conversation
It's B.G and L.T.
Never had a friend like him
He never had a friend like me
Snorted half a grand of dope
On the flight together
Broke trying to make all night together
Now Lil' Ten gon' be a part
Of my life forever
Wish Lord wouldn't of took you to rest you
Look me and my dog broke bread together
Hot, fucking hoes in the same bed together

[Chorus]
Of top, it's all gravy, you in six feet
Just remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left out here solo
I'm doing the damn thing for me and you both
Off top, it's all gravy, you in six fett
But remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left me out here solo
But I'm fucking hoes for me and you both

[Verse Two]
1997, November I had bad days in my life
It looked like that was the worst
Niggas shot my round like a dog
Left him for dead
Chest bust wide open
Non-stop he blead
Just the day before we talked about gettin sober
In the blink of an eye
My whodi life is over
I know there's a good reason
Why the good Lord chose you
I know when your at your real
Cause down here you was a soldier
Always said ""Do it, it can't be faded""
Always said ""Do it you gon' make it""
And I made It
I wish you were here to see
It's all gravy, I know you want me to let that be
Man I hate it
I know you don't want me to be weak
So when I sheine, you shine
It's off the T-O-P
You was the Livin' Legend in the UPT
Do me a favor you and my daddy look down on me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You should see I'm balling out of control
I just got a deal with Cotsh for six zeros
And I had to be heavenly baby and niggas was hoes
They wasn't playin the game
Hot Gold, it's over, it's cool
I'm a gangsta in the game I know the street rules
And I miss all my people that's resting in peace
And I miss all my people that's six feet deep
You heard me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Believe that
You know I'm holding it down ya heard me
Man I miss you with a passion dog
But I know where you at
You know what I'm sayin, that you holding down
And I know you got a place for me
And I know you done met my daddy ya heard me
And y'all done got the fahotion y'all know what I'm sayin
Ya'll just looking down and sayin

'cause they know it's on and poppin
Nigga this is for you blind fools who
Fillin pockets and groove
Fuck you and yo' jealousy
'cause niggas always talkin' the shit about me rappin'

But you want to hold hands and walk through the strugglin
Now nigga please, money didn't never grow on trees
If it did you'd see the D-are-E rakin' leaves
So wake up
That shit is just a dream and your trippin
That's why I keep my heat on the seat when I'm dippin

B.J. Cole,"Good girl gonna fucking bad 
I thought she fuck me good she askin' where the party at? 
She beautiful so she get away with it 
And all of this in hopes of her making it

[Chorus]
Beautiful girl 
No matter who you are 
Whether a superstar whether you regular
You know I love you girl
This one's for you girl
This one's for you girl
This one's for you girl
This one's for you girl

I think I met her bout' a year ago 
College girl she was a Florida State Seminole 
Had a job at the mall workin' ten to fo'
Hella fine I ain't lyin' y'all don't hear me though
So I'm walkin' right up to her, hey my name Ace
She replied with a smile and said her name's Shea 
Very conservative, i luv that
Fitted jeans, rockin' J's and a snap-back 
Yeah but I can see that she would kill a girl 
See you hidin' that physique, you better get it girl 
And you the shit but she don't' know yet 
Turnin' red got her blushin' where your mama at
Cause all I wanna do is thank her 
I'm using beautiful and gorgeous in the same verse
I swear I'm trippin you just got me open 
And hope we can get acquainted what I'm highly hopin'

[Chorus]

And I just hope this got you motivated 
That's cause your body got me cultivated 
Seeing your fine ass alone I just can't tolerate it
And all your friends say I'm a dog every conversation 
Mad cause you smiling more on a daily basis 
Tell me why they hating everything's accommodated
I'm just searching for your love but I'll be very patient 
True story had a thing before we started dating 
Say she never heard beautiful so many times 
Silly guys approaching with all wrong lines 
That's a reason for being a single a long time 
And all the roses I sent you pleasure was all mine 
Yeah women are beautiful in many ways 
Confidence a stain never let it wipe away 
What's a man without a woman I'm just here to say 
Yeah I'm just here to say

Dancing to the beat
Out there on a limb

And make the zombies fight

And the city is mine tonight

Out there table dancing
In the city that eats the sky
Out there table dancing
In the city that eats the sky

And it's love by illusion (all right)

With leather jackets and gasoline
You can use your attitude
Let the city get you in the mood

We can dream, we can dream
Of adventure in the land of love
We can dream of adventure in the land of love

If you in the back come on, throw your hands up
If you in the front, you can throw your hands up
If you on the side, you can throw your hands up
Wave 'em in the sky, you can throw your hands up
Yo its aiight if you want to throw your hands up
You and you and you could throw your hands up

On the regular oh-ooh, you know who
Uh-huh (x3)

[Buckshot]

Yo there used to be a rumor about BDI
I wouldn't come back, I tell you no lie
But when I listen to the radio I think
Whenever I'm back, I'm bound to make a link
With the music that used to make me jam and jump
Thump while the bass bump
Tellin BJ throw on the wax that's playin the Therapy mix
You said it was aiight, we made a remix
Licks after licks take ticks
Of the time clock
be	-D-Buck a shot, uh, take it to the top
See I'm bound to make your body pop
One nation under a groove, so my beat'll never stop
When I heard about the beef between the East and the West coast
Called my nigga Kurupt, I knew it was boast
They hope a nigga in the music with this bomb
So I prepare load my arms
And wait, cause its the last time

Chorus [F.L.O.W.]

This is the last time i will
Ever struggle
This is the last time i will
Ever fall

[BJ Swan]

My moms gotta take in second-hand bum smoke 
Just to keep from breakin, goin broke
And if you read my diary it'd break your heart
Cause I been losin like a mutherfucka from the start
Excuse me--but that's the only way that I can express
My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair 
For real

Chorus (x2)

[Steele]

Eyes watch as I make moves
Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I ain't sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my be	 and see
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time 
I'm sure

[F.L.O.W.]

No more strugglin
No more pain
Only good times after this
I pray

B.J. The Chicago Kid,"Bitch I'm ten toes in it
Not a fake a facade or a cloned image
Got into rap same way I jumped in the streets with my own spinach
Tryin' to get straight up off this shit so that I can go on livin'
No song spinnin' so I resort to this zone flippin'
Something must wrong wit em, he takin' this shit for granted
Try to write up in the house with no lights, you'll understand it
I can't teach ya how to dougie, but I can teach ya bout this thuggin'
Keepin' it thorough, keep your mouth closed, nigga, keep it one-hundred
Keep yo hand up out my goddamn pocket - keep it pushin'
Keep the reefer keep the white keep the soft and just keep it cookin'
But keep in mind that any given day you can die for this
As I bag this dope I'm prayin' one day that I could just
Make an honest piece of change, prolly change the way I live
MJ, fadeaway, something niggas can't defend
Gangsta Gibbs, fresh out the fridge, forty below flow

So let me talk my shit
So what you talkin' bout, bitch?

Really ain't shit if you ain't talk bout this
I'm runnin' laps around these rappers scratchin' em off my lists
She off that vodka so it's hard for her to stay off my dick
Tryin' get rich and let the dollars flow throughout my click
So we can break bread and never ever be broken
Yac toastin', exotic bitches on my balcony smokin
Weed turns them out without a doubt they mouth about to be open
I let Alicia put her tongue on Valerie while Iâm strokin'
But I ain't Jack Tripper, I'm that nigga plain and simple
Fresh out the G to MTV, check the credentials
Ain't been a nigga bigger since the Jacksons left the city
Reppin' the hardest niggas ain't know that we was rappin' in my city
And regardless if I got support or backin' from my city
They'll remember me as the the nigga that got it crackin' for my city, nigga
And on the mic I never have off nights
Cause every line I write is straight frostbite, nigga

You already know this
But I'm the motherfuckin' coldest
You sayin' that you did that, lived that
But you ain't quite this, nigga
Cause you already noticed
But I'm the motherfuckin coldest
I keep it really real
Sayin' what the fuck I feel
So let me talk my shit
So what you talkin' bout, bitch?

I'm on fire
To keep the streets hot, that's my desire
And to hell with the labels
Till it's time for us to sit down at the table
If I don't focus on me
Tell me, who will?
And I speak from my heart
So you know I'mma keep it real
So much bullshit in the last six months tried to take my focus
But on a lotta situations them people have to hocus pocus
If anybody ever asks a dumb question like ""Will BJ make it?""
Give them a dollar and say ""God bless you, cause you must be a basehead""

That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I""m right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry about it
I give em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin' a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems: more money, more drugs and violence

But death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice
What would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more
Do more
But tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven saying
They at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers

Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me

Thought we was gonna live to see it all

Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
Watching for some yellow diamonds
Yes I'm on the phone you losers
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that mickey d's
When I know when the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated
Went to college got married

Now drive by is by the lost that kill bay base kids

If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second
Look at me wrong I turn you to tomb stones
Lock you in the crosshairs then you gone, then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your seÃ±orita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence
Then you gon' wonder where your highness went

I bet she get low for a nigga like me
She get low for a nigga like me
I bet she get low for a nigga like me
Low for a nigga like me

So we burn the mary jane til' the third degree
Some niggas bitin' flows yo, that's burglary
Same niggas actin' like they never heard of me
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me

He get blown for a nigga like me
Get his head explode for a nigga like me
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me

My mind boggles when time toggles
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twisted up
So we put it in the air
Don't let the j's start unravelling
We gettin' blown like a javelin
She throw it back like she time travelin'
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming ""Land, ho!"" 'bout to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure-like nice beaches-that
Even at my weakest I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches?
Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for actin' a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for makin' a move

We get high and say ""fuck the police""
That's why we get high and say ""fuck the police""
That's why we get high and say ""fuck the police""

Cause every time I make a move they be sweatin' me
They want another black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me
It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't lettin' me

You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG

Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace

I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me

I'm something like the chairman of the board rantin'
I feel, invincible, like McMahon
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damnit
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical New York City bandit
True warrior like rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it
Let me take a seat, this a Rosa Parks 'ol bum, now
Make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I just wanna be good, I just wanna be
I just wanna be free

Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me",Like Me,2015

New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T

Dope dealers over tipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day I'm like ""what the fuck?""
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit
And was like ""What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like""
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)
This one of those dreams you don't wake up from
Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from
When the sun shines and they bust nines
Don't dial 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something

When niggas I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free

No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over

Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor, the shah is Liz Dozier

We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry, there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes

Looking for her in the day with a flashlight that type

You should have seen your boy last night, that's right
Acting like I was a God in the past life
This is your last try if I don't act right
This what you said the last time
We know each other so well that we past lying
And we past crying, and we past fighting
It's like dealing with women my favorite pastime
I love finding trails to path find ain't nothing like it
When you stopped calling that was a bad sign
Remember you would blow up the bat line now flatline
I was scared to fall asleep so I nap light
One eye open and my phone in my path of sight
Hoping I don't wake up to a cat fight
Exposed like them hotel sheets in the black light
You let me cook like the pot was cast iron

It's left for the children, the hate is so real son
But they full of jealousy and it's killing them
They stressed in their feelings
When I tell her don't let them affect how she feels
She throw the blame right back at me, how we expect to heal?
Investigating like she be waiting for a detective shield
Better still feeling insecure about her sex appeal
She know she cute when she catching a little attitude
She know I love her when she wear her hair natural
She let me back in her life and I show my gratitude
I try to curb my habit of acting like other rappers do

And stir the darkness in my mind.

Little know who haunts my mind.

And it dances in my head.

Slumber softly in their beds.

Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go

She is living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Mamma's gonna love her just as much as she can,as she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
A walkin' to town to find a job

Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
And the chills to the bone
Oh,you better go home where it's warm

Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mamma's gonna love her just as much as she can,as she can

But the closer the knit,the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away

And with whole lotta love and a warm conversation
And plenty of prayer

B.J. Thomas,"Such a pretty little face,
With a heart that's been torn.
Living in a borrowed space,
From the moment she was born.
How many times shes cried,
But never tears of joy.
Someones taken a little girl, and made a broken toy.

Two sad little eyes,
Painted heartbreak blue.
The simplest of his dreams,
Never will come true.
Someone elses pain,
Fell on this little boy.
Someones taken a soldier,
And made a broken toy.

Broken toys,
Who will mend these broken toys?
For everyone one we break,
A broken life takes its place.

That one day will break toys of its own.
Oh Lord, we've got to mend these broken toys.
And let them be children again,
Give back the innocence stolen from them.

B.J. Thomas,"Caught in the heat of passion
Out on the edge of town
I tried to get to heaven on a highway
Hungry for satisfaction

And now I'm standing here alone
With nothing but a heartache.

Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
Throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky

Too many cold embraces
Chilling me to the bone
I held her for awhile before I lost her
Nothing but nameless faces
Out in the combat zone
Where love will last you for a moment
And leave you in the shadows.

And ever since lived by the golden rule

And back home

Billy was getting less and less strong

And then like a miracle a letter appeared 
Billy tore open and he read 
""Dear John"" 

A look came over Billy that would scare a ghost 
A familiar look on soldiers from coast to coast 
And even though the air was filled with lead

Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

This star drew nigh to the northwest,
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Within that house the King did lie,
One entered it them for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty.

Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

This Child truly there He was,
For want of clothing they did Him lay

Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made Heaven and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.

Where oxen feed on hay

Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath our tree

That packages and bows
Can never heal
The hurting human soul

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start 
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

That wars would never start 
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

 So we grew up together, my mama-child and me
 Now things were bad and she was scared but whenever I would cry
 She'd calm my fear and dry my tears
 With a rock and roll lullaby

 And she'd sing

 And we'd dream of better mornin's when mama sang a song
 Now I can't recall the words at all, it don't make sense to try

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And that preacher's words still fill my head
And I hear them now and then he said

Do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling
And I said yes just lead me on

And our final high school dance was just about over
I was old enough for the taste of love
When boys turn into men

And I'll never forget I remember it yet

But the preacher's words I barely heard 
As sweet Bonnie Lou gave in   she said

She was sitting at the end of the bar when I saw her
And with a little wine and an little time 
She would be a prize to win

And weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference

It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

You got a lotta nerve, nigga
I should throw a brick through your shit, fuck your whips
It ain't about that, it's about you givin' out my dick
Or so it seems, I can only call it how I see it
Got hoes callin' the crib, hangin' up not speakin'
Come on, what type of shit is that?
What, I'm supposed to sit back, stay up all night for you to get back?
Like the world revolves around P
So while you strolled in at 5 I was comin' in at 3, 3:30
Niggas wanna play dirty
Fuck it, that's how you wanna rock? Let's get dirty
Yeah, condom wrappers in the back of the Azure
Talkin' 'bout you let your mans get off, your G ain't strong
I'm gone, you ain't worth the tears
You lost the best thing you ever had in your life, a waste of my years

Have you ever had a bitch that'll pop guns for you?
Type of nigga you'll do anything he ask to?
Snake bitch turn around and backstab you?
Crab nigga found out he fuckin' 'round too?
Threw her cash, threw in the smash, that's boo
Rockin' your 4 wheel drive and tattoo
Talk sweet thinkin' that he rockin' you to sleep?
Who me? Fall for that bullshit, you got the wrong bitch

I might give out, but I'll never give in
We might as well, be friends, yes we have",Trials of Love,2000
B.K. Diaz,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Home where my music's playing,

B.M.R.,"When I was an infant in my mothers arms
I would watch the starlight in her face
'Cause I was reaching out to understand the cosmic charm
I am just a star child born in space.

Way up high above the sky
All that beauty passes by
Whole worlds still unknown
And out beyond the blue
There's a place for people too
It's time for us to go.

I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I have been there, I have seen it

Repeat chorus
We have time
(In my dreams)
Time and space
While we're young
(Floating free)
We can chase to the stars.

Searching for the magic in the universe
Guided by the stars that light my way
I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I am just a star child born in space",Starchild,2005
B.o.B,"Already got one, rolled up in my left hand
P**** on my mind, tighter than a headband
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands
This s*** I'm on, better than the next strand
Than the next strand, better than the next strand
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan
I make that p**** whistle like the Old Spice man
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback
Like a cornerback, that's an interception
You think I give a f***, that's a misconception
Oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I said, oh what a night, oh what a night
Yeah she a bad b****, all jokes aside

Hey, look at baby over there
Whats up, little mama come here
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (whoa)
Like she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror (whoa)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Like she do it in the mirror

I chop one, chop two, chop that a** down
Chop that a** down, chop chop that a** down
All I want you to do is just drop that a** down
Drop drop that a** down, now look back at it

Whistling Dixie
Middle school, I was getting head on a ten speed
Jiggalo blood line, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Bet you can f*** with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead a** rapper should have came with a cemetery
I am so cold, n**** like Ben & Jerry
Fill a n****, deal a n****, kill a n****, obituary
My vision blurry, these b****es flirtin'
I've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her a** would knock your a** out, you better stick and move (True)
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

Hey, look at baby over there
Whats up, little mama come here
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (whoa)
Like she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror(whoa)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Like she do it in the mirror

I chop one, chop two, chop that a** down
Chop that a** down, chop chop that a** down
All I want you to do is just drop that a** down
Drop drop that a** down, now look back at it

She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I tell her like, do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a n**** feel welcome like a doormat's there
I'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night
That's a bad b****, all jokes aside there she go

Hey, look at baby over there

You got me breaking the bank, got me spending my dough

Yeah my parents tried to pre warn me
But now we higher than E-40 and King Gordy
When I'm in the studio recording it seems boring
Until you come around each morning and reward me
You loosened my nerves when I was feeling uptight
You had me falling in love but kept me up every night
We've been together for years I can't believe that it lasted
I'll love you 'till you're gone and you're nothing but ashes

I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I remember thinking man I need a decent ride
And I would have to ask my momma for the keys to drive
With my brother riding in an old Cutlass
Black and Mild lit, whole hoof busted
Well who knows maybe one day we'll have a little more
We'll finally shop somewhere else besides the corner store
My little sister say she gotta have a pair of Dior's
But right now they'll probably stop us before we hit the door
My Uncle say that's how it is where we come from
And if it weren't for bad luck, we wouldn't have none
Hard to tell the good days from the bad ones
If I could catch a shooting star then I would grab one
I'd grab one for real

I remember feelin' trapped and no I couldn't get out
And when they laid my momma off no it just didn't amount
I still remember how she looked when she walked into the house
But still she tried her best to show what was Christmas about
And if we wanted hot water we had to microwave it
And everyday the power cut off but we tolerate it
The thoughts of all the beats I lost because I forgot to save 'em
I'm screaming at me in the mirror like ""I gotta make it!""
My teacher tryin' to get through to me because of my behavior
I said ""I got big dreams and I gotta chase 'em""
I never cared a damn thing about a college major
I only had one need, that was a lot of paper
But see I never had a thing but a lot of prayers
After school, open mic night, rockin' stages
It all started from a demo, to a limo
From a limo, to a Lambo
And all of this came up outta Decatur, 'cause

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine

I used to dream about these days and the things that I'd do
Had to get a new life, 'cause the old just won't do
I used to dream shades of grey, now the sky's shinin' blue
And everyday it feels like there's no way I can lose

'Cause I knew one day, I wouldn't have to wait in line

And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see

Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddamn it we made it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to gs that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care

But I ain't reached my cruisee altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said look out for me
And see these expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in seeapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like whats up motherfucker!

About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)

Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
So all we got is street cred and a cool building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from (answer that)
Jeffrey standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time goddamn good at it

About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)

A liqueur store in every corner in Atlanta
Cops riding round tossing niggas in the slammer
Tell me what's wrong I could really use some answers
Nowadays everybody wants to be a rapper
About two years ago everybody was a trapper
Obviously money is what everybody's after
Cos slavery ain't changed it's a modern day disaster
Now these are my words from me to you
Everything you do from your shades to your shoes
From your chains to your coupe came from the two
Trust me I would know I was raised on the two
Ok, now let me just get your attention
Imma turn the tables so you don't get defensive
Imma put my bullshit aside for a second
Cos I cant be fake, cos God won't let me
I used to wear a grill because it was the trend
Not because I liked it, I just wanted to fit in
Then I got Eastside tatted on my skin
And I tried to get dreads but my hair was too big
But I was lost, I ain't know who I was
What else was there to do besides look like a thug

So in my senior year at Columbia High
I dropped out of High School when I got signed
B.o.B was the name, I ain't like Bobby Ray 'cause I was ashamed
But you can call me Bobby Ray from this day forth and
I could give a damn about the fame and fortune
Honestly I don't even listen to rap
'Cause when I turn the radio on, out comes crap
And if you make good music that's okay, but
On the radio that they don't play
Its easy to see we created a beast
'Cause everybody wants to hear what they don't need
And now all the rappers got a stoller to give you
That bullshit music so they can continue to live
The position that I'm in is quite an interesting predicament I will admit
But you can count on me cos I'm refusing to give in
'Cause Imma give you music cos we need it to exist, bitch
So imma play my guitar, rap about aliens and sing about stars
Til you understand that's what we are
So we ain't got to struggle no more so we don't starve
I swear to God I love you with every bar
We all got problems that need to be solved

I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah yeah somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway
And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time-travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes, and
I see Mindfreak like, ""What's up man, what's happenin'?""
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no Ghost or Poltergeist

I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia

You'll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone we gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets
We hope up on the mother ship an we gone, we sliding
We slipping through dimensions, we hyper space gliding
Blasting through the atmosphere
Frightening in the lightening

So, so by the time I'm done their ain't gonna be no more mics
And people ask me B.o.B what kind of language is that
Cause I may blast into the future, I may never come back
And I'm a leave with a thirty thousand a night yearly
Headed to a distant planet called B.o.B

All systems go in  ten seconds I'm orbiting
Hanging in the cosmos like a space ornament
Heat 'em up like a solar flare oh yes I bring the pain
Similar to asteroid that's headed to your brain
My lane is something that they really cannot explain
They try to hold me down but  man it's me that they cant contain

Shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
(Ooh) Let's go (ooh) let's go
Shorty I cant take earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

Come and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy
I'm talking Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mars, Mars
And I'm saying girl, I'll ride all night
And I need you for this ship to take flight
Let's go, let's go
Come on baby let me take it off
Another second we gone blast it off

Look shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway

Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes

I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that

Soon you'll find (yeah)
What you can't replace

I gave away my love
That I promised you I would keep
A thousand deaths I died that day
When two became one
A greater force pulled you away
So I got on my knees and begged
The silence replaced my tears
So goodbye, my love
August 1, 1965

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

So please
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new
And oh, of all the things I've seen
This has got to be, got to be the greatest tragedy
Oh you, you let it all slip away
But soon you'll find

B.o.B,"I don't know why she's with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
If I was her, by now I would have left me
I would have walked away
But now I've broken away
Somehow instead she forgave me
She said a woman's got to do what she's got to do
Even if it means she denied herself the truth
'Cause when you're in too deep you wake up when it's too late,
You've fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now then you'll stay
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me

So walk away
(walk away)
Walk away, oh
Save yourself from the heartache, oh
Go now before it's too late
So walk away
(walk away)
Walk away, oh
Save yourself from the heartache, oh
Go now before it's too late
But still she stays

She's standing in the heart of darkness
Saying I know you got a soul even though you're heartless
How could any woman in their right mind be so blind,
To find something this safe
Instead of walking with me she should have walked away

She finds color in the darkest places
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces
For such a clued in, headstrong city girl
Could've had the world but she's fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now then you'll stay
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me

So walk away

Walk away, oh

B.o.B,"Woah, woah what you got me charged with?
We're gonna have you charged with possession of cocaine with intention to distribute
Man, I ain't sold that, man! That, man, why is you doin' that, man?

The rhymes I design are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine
Flows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes
Giving birth to the lines, soul search for the prize
I takes my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT, while these other niggas bite
Underrated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight
Night, night, I recite when I step up to this mic
Reputation trunk tight, like the husband on a wife
Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on the smash

I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W
Leave the rest to you, destitute, now put that money up
Oh, your conscience is nonsense
How you expect to get a little restitution with all this ghetto flyness?
Snow, that's for toboggans, no, won't be no pardons
Or bargains, three striked, then yanked up like a rod
Uh, with no apartments, and no home to run to
You're snitching on yourself, and now your front door, they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do was listen to the raps in your songs

Lights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue
This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through
All wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)
The boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new
Something new, something new, something new

Straight out the plastic, like a pack of puddings, no show
My nigga, you can not see me, and that's fo' show, fo' do'
Any kind of Cadillac, I go slow
When I'm smokin' on some of that choco, no low, no mid
Top of the line pine, 'cause I blow big
Been 'round here for a while
Your mama like my style, and so do your kids
I know you love it, because a hater loves to hate
Boy, you need me like a junkie need a razor blade and plate

B.o.B,"I see you

I see you looking at me
Looking at me, so I ask

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

You're crazy,
I like you, but you're crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to whom bathe me
Never know that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades, rev x steady they couldn't endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with her cigarette
In the same spot ten times in a row
When I felt that burn upon the clitoris?
I'ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away,
I feel stupid 'cause I ain't did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts,
I get vexed but I ain't bit her neck
Open, I try to contain it but that damn dame thang's soakin'
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange lane hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain't nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I'm suffering, I'm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin' hollerin' my god,
Afterwards I like really hots scolding water on my balls

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Mom? Dad? I'm no longer the boy you're used to seeing
I've changed a lot, plus I've grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I'm doing things I don't normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would of put down the mic and say
Fuck it I'll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain,
I could probably jump without your name
No lovey-dovey let's ignite the flame
If you're lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain't very marry to say,
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute,
I'm stressin' the game if I go to hell,
Then heavens to blame
I don't mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think that I'm hella deranged (hey)
When I was seven years old,
I fell on my head and I severed my brain (hey)
If you think I'm lying then
Ask my mama nigga she'll can tell you the same
Should I be ashamed?
No, I'm living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent outta a shape my nigga let me ask you this

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

I stab you with this mic
And rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter fact I'm rapping through you,
Never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Can't even see you niggas,
Y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion
To use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes
Is just like old fashion voodoo
Y'all ain't even the shit,
No y'all ain't even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my toobos
So I'm slapping you foolish
With wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic
But it's more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I'm all up out of my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here,
Give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I could peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma fill it crack when I hit it,
Then I'ma spill it back when you heal it
Damn it Bobby boy, what in the hell,
What in the heaven, what in the earth
Where is your mom? What are you cursed?
Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where were you first?
Why weren't you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt?
Man I think that you're going berserk

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?

It's just someone that I call B.O.B,
It's kinda me but it's not,
It's just a mask that I got,
So that I can rap and get off my block,
Reminiscin my past when I was a todler,
Sittin in grass and playin with blocks,
Failing my classes now I'm on lockdown,
Now writin and readin alot,
Money and weed is in my shoe box now,
While I'm tryina get me a glock,
Cause I thought I was at the end of my line,
Then I find out it was all in my mind,
That's why I'm here to end all the fear,

Cause they feel that if they black then they gotta have it too,
But ya'll don't really seen that there,
After all everybody wanna kick back,
They wanna sit back,
They wanna sip Goose,
They wanna get down,
They wanna get loose,
They wanna get blown,
They wanna see the truth,
They wanna get old just like you,
But since they ain't nobody gon be responsable,

The beginning of the calm before the storm

You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a n**** wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge bout twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act
And the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern for the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball

To every single time that they play this song
You can say that thatâs what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that have molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs

B.o.B,"Since day one I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
But the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
And the waters getting deeper so I must set out to sail
Someone called my cell, and left a voicemail
They said congratulations on the million record sales
As I'm flippin' over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf

It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

Yeah, I've seen the valley of the shadow of death
I've seen the mountains, a wild childhood
That's why I sing about it
I just try to move on and keep my peace about it
But come to think about it I can't even count the days
That I spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing
It's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent
So ask me about the music scene and what the fuck I think about it
Time flies I guess that's why I'm buggin'
Just yesterday I was rappin with my brother and my cousin
If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
We knew that we were struggling we just actin' like we wasn't
It was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling
So all I see is magazine covers in this game
You either surface or you plummet
It's a thin line and I'm just tryin' to keep my head above it, damn

B.o.B,"Whatever happened to Bobby Ray, he used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you, youâre constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too
Since all the fortune youâve been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant and your daddyâs been going through it
Since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him and show him, you support him
I never thought you would sell out
Youâre becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
You walked right by me, Iâm like
Ain't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag
Come on Bob, I thought you was better than that dog
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation Lost
You were my idol, just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody)

I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody)
(Melody, melody, melody)

Whatever happened to B.o.B. he once was my favorite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my playlist
He was hood, but so different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air, every time he rhymed
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love
The girls, the money, the lifestyle
All the above
I guess he stopped giving a fuck
For all of his little people
With your shades on, we canât even see you
Is that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping
They taste the fame and change likes it just automatic
Whereâs the integrity, you on that other shit
You donât even sound the same, I liked your other shit
But weâll stand beside you, 'cause somewhere deep inside you
Thereâs more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible you were my idol
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody)

I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)
(Melody, melody, melody)

I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
Who woulda ever thought I woulda caught the world by the ears
I swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured
But if it wasnât meant to be this wouldnât be my career
Itâs like, people only see it, the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
Blood sweat and tears, we cry but always swear thereâs tears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field
All of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me
You never know whoâs gonna play you and make you look phoney
I live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies
We put it all on the line, we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
'Cause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit
I call it making a way for our survival

We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a ""69""
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck""

When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""

If you got 20/20 vision
You can see me now handling this music with precision
If not, then it's fine with me
Just know this movement is vivid enough for the blind to see, Yates

How in the hell can you miss me
When I'm counting my mil' making hist'ry
Trip the splits be that 50/50
So we rip the script swiftly and zip through chips quickly
When the trash, mail and pizza man see me
They get a fever and cheesy when they see the man Neezy
I'm easily beast and my hand is in my belt
What? I'm independent and I'm feeling myself
A flunk I won't be
I bumps the trunks see
The ladies pop the monkey and drop the donkey
They want to flaunt me
My songs be funky
Steady getting that cheddar forever

I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio

I'm rolling up and let the contact get him

Kept my real niggas close

I hear people saying why so many changes?
Why so many watches? Why so many chains?

Riding in my Porsche listening to Purple Rain
So much knowledge I came up on you as a Hollywood insider
The inside of my crib look like a gym

You ride the bench that mean you ain't playing
You understand, hella fans
Bunching hands, hundred grands that's the plan

I do request for all of you people to listen
I do see checks and movie sets
And never been a stranger to vixens
Pick up the pen, its in my gut to win
I got a motive and Iâm in it with a mission
You know what I'mma get it when I dip into it
I've been through it, I've been a fighter with a vision
You can cover your eye, brother but why?
Cause your lady just discovered that my
Big rubber defies your lover blubber
So you utter replies with a tougher disguise
'Cause my payday just caught the nose of your lady
I'm at the beginning of my hay-day
Y'all better recognize like Â¡Mayday!
I don't know why jokers just won't let their eyes notice
Deep in my vocals they keep yelling that I'm doper

The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a smoke break
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doing

Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills

You got an addiction

Errybody gotta grip onto something
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
That people that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet

Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up wit' me cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!""
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different
I love all the money, the fame
And the parties with beautiful women
I spend so much time as an underground artist
'Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn when they pivot
And change you perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Everything possible
When I told 'em my dreams, they just said they ain't logical

And if they did, I'd still be missing, eyah

Who knew that this much success would make it so hard
But that's to accept the fact that I can't go back where I left
And back track my steps, back track my steps
The records I dropped, so massive, so large
It makes it hardcore hip-hop to digest
The things that I do, I guess if it's true
Well fuck it, a nigga too good to be the best
Too good to be the best, too good to be stressed
'Cause this the type of life, too good to regret

No respect, no respect yea

And smash grills I could never smash
And live fantasies that'll never last

And when you get a million it's a different type of feeling
When you look around and what you really need is missing

Can't find a doctor to fill out the prescription
Or diagnose the illness
Can't leave it in the book, can't buy from the dealer

And I find it ironic
Yeah, I find it ironic
How I can buy anything that I ever wanted
But I really had it all when I ain't have nothing
They always say that mo money, mo problems
I guess I, I guess I should've listened to the warning
I guess I, I guess I should anticipate the stormy weather
I guess I'd illustrate a different story,
However, well if it's clever
I couldn't find the words to say it better
I'm knee-deep within these endeavors
But all that glitters with gold is not treasure
I'm ready for whatever, I never let up
I work even better when I'm under pressure

On the road to get it 'cause, when it rain, it pour

Got annoyed from every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the backseat bass and the lobster bisk
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown

Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on 'er

Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate

Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor

Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day

And you really know already what I'm gonna drop
Hella money, mami wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that you're making it bounce and you're moving it, doing it
See the way that you're breaking it down and the way that you got them all losing it

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Man, I remember before I say that wait, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub standard condition still handling business

Still laughing and tripping, still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddammit we did it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flipping it 8 days

Thought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper
We made in all dimes, I ain't lying, the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time

I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
Around here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here

Only listen to G's that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at nigga's careers
But talk about it for years and now we finally here

But I ain't reached my cruising altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, look out for me

Exceeded expectations even at def jam
'Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works for six figures
'Cause I'm a self made nappy headed rich nigga

Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
'Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school

Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put 'em all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners

Order in Singapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's
And rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act, nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like what's up motherfucker

I used to dream, I used to dream, oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I sing, now I sing, oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world, the whole world

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
'Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
Know from down there to ya'll it seem like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough, I'm still trying to triple up

So all we got is street cred and akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much shit, I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks

Triple that on my bond thanks to Bigs and Ron
But never mind what I've been through, just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her

I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them

Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
Just from standing around wishing, huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it

I used to dream, I used to dream, oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I sing, now I sing, oh whoa

And now I sing, sing, sing, sing

No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddamn it we made it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to gs that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care

But I ain't reached my cruisee altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said look out for me
And see these expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in seeapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers

We feelin' get high
Yes higher than you've ever been
Higher than cloud nine
We're going where you've never been

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap

And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?

And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Three, six, nine the goose drank wine 
The monkey chewed the tobacco on the street car line 
And the line broke and the monkey got chocked 
And they all went to heaven in a lil' row boat, clap clap

If you got a problem, I don't wanna hear it 
Just let it go all my lady's on the beat 
Let me see you drop it to the floor

Fella's take a look around 
Lady's are so fine 
Is goin' down so get on up now 
Act like your second on line

Three, six, nine the goose drank wine 
The monkey chewed the tobacco on the street car line 
And the line broke and the monkey got chocked 
And they all went to heaven in a lil' row boat, clap clap

Three, six, nine the goose drank wine 
The monkey chewed the tobacco on the street car line 
And the line broke and the monkey got chocked 
And they all went to heaven in a lil' row boat, clap clap

Acting like a rattle the way she movin' 
Faster then go slow like a doller 
So maybe me and her can get to chewing like tobacco 
This old fashion talk but my thing is rather dather 
And plus I got my swagga like a pistol seen me everywhere 
But because I be on my gizzle that mean am on my grind all the time 
No matter how little her name is call me up meet you in a lil bit
So I'm tryin' to see if she can clap clap

Independent women let me see you clap clap
Playa's in the building let me see you clap clap
Came to get it started let me see you clap clap
Came to have a party let me see you clap clap

Or just a moment's pleasure

And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine

I'd never ask for anything again

Was ist dein Problem MÃ¤del, komm sagÂ´s mir in mein Gesicht

Doch ich glaube, dass du mich betrÃ¼gst
Warum bist du dann so wie du bist und distanzierst dich von mir

Ich hab' mein Album fertig bekommen
So mit Herzblut und ehrlichen Songs
Mit Ach und Krach das hier geschafft
Ganze vier Jahre gebraucht, das es passt

Ich hab' gesehen, wie sich die ganze Welt verpisst
Und danke meiner AnwÃ¤ltin fÃ¼r nichts
Hab' mir den Arsch aufgerissen,
Die Decke fiel mir auf den Kopf
Kauf' dir den ScheiÃ man , ich rappe nicht umsonst!

Ich hoffe es rentiert sich
Das nÃ¤chste Album dann mit vierzig
Deshalb brauch ich ganz viel Kohle die ich von euch hole

Dann kommt wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Von mir und ich denk' ich kann's mir leisten
Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Und ich fÃ¼hl' mich wie der Geilste.
Wieder vier Jahre nichts hÃ¶ren
WÃ¼rde mich gar nicht so stÃ¶ren
Ich verprass' die Kohle frei von Sinnen
Und komm' zurÃ¼ck, wenn ich dann Pleite bin.

Yeah, wÃ¼nsch' mir Geld und GlÃ¼ck
Und wenn ich Gold geh, komm ich nich' so schnell zurÃ¼ck,
Dann kenn' ich keinen der Jungs mehr
Dann hab' ich einen der mich rumfÃ¤hrt
Amina MillionÃ¤r
Schieb' den Ã¼belsten Starfilm
Geh' in den Club, sag dem DJ dass ich da bin
Spiel' mein Song und 'ne Flasche auf's Haus
Und wenn ich keine kriege, dika raste ick aus
Verlass' meine Frau
Denn hab jetzt mies Erfolg
Und bumse noch mit Frida Gold
Zieh' mein Geld durch die Nase, mir egal was ihr wollt

Jetzt hÃ¶rt ihr wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Von mir und ich denk' ich kann's mir leisten
Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Und ich fÃ¼hl' mich wie der Geilste
Wieder vier Jahre nichts hÃ¶ren
WÃ¼rde mich gar nicht so stÃ¶ren
Ich verprass' die Kohle frei von Sinnen
Und komm' zurÃ¼ck, wenn ich dann Pleite bin

Und nach vier Jahren bin ich wieder abgebrannt
Hab nix Bares und 'n Minus vor dem Kontostand
Dann komm ich wieder an bei meiner Frau
Steh mit Koffern vor der TÃ¼r doch ein Anderer macht auf
Shit, muss wieder mal ein Diss aufnehmen
Weil mein Name im Club nicht mehr auf der Liste steht
Nur noch 'n Bus oder billigen Wagen
So'n ScheiÃ, nicht mal Frida Gold will mir ein blasen, es ist
HÃ¶chste Zeit, mein Album muss kommen, weil ich
'Ne Abmahnung von Aldo bekomm' bevor ich
Alles verlier' und alles weg ist, na dann rapp' ich

Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Von mir und ich denk' ich kann's mir leisten
Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Und ich fÃ¼hl' mich wie der Geilste
Wieder vier Jahre nichts hÃ¶ren
WÃ¼rde mich gar nicht so stÃ¶ren

Wieder Vier Jahre nicht mehr

B.S.H. (Bass Sultan Hengzt),"Okay, wo fangen wir an?
Schon mit der Schule hab ich's mies verkackt
Nichts probiert und nicht studiert
Bisher hab ich's einfach noch zu nichts gebracht
Und Schulden hab' ich tonnenweise
Wie konnte das passieren?
Ich kÃ¶nnte mit meinen Rechnungen WÃ¤nde tapezieren
Was soll die ScheiÃe?
Alles hab' ich abbekommen
Alles, das was schlecht ist
Alles haben sie mitgenommen
Was nicht niet- und nagelfest ist
Jeden Tag der selbe Kack, nichts zu tun

Und will da ehrlich zu dir sein
Mein Studio ist eher rustikal
Und die Breitling um meinen Arm ist nur ein Dublikat
Schon im Kindergarten musst' ich mit mir selber spielen
Und die HÃ¤lfte meiner Freunde bei Facebook sind nur Fakeprofile
Leider ist mein Marktwert bei den Frauen auch sehr gesunken
Mit denen ich dann noch was hatte, die waren eher betrunken
Nein ich will dich nicht belÃ¼gen

Okay, du weiÃt Bescheid
Manchmal kommt viel scheiÃe raus, wenn ich was sage
Man muss mir die Sachen so erklÃ¤ren als wÃ¤r ich noch fÃ¼nf Jahre
Und kann auch nicht gut mit Geld umgehen
Bei mir ist nichts mit Pfennig drehen
Doch kann ganz laut im Kino stÃ¤ndig an mein Handy gehen
Ja, ich kann schon peinlich sein, und taktlos allemal
Kann schon passieren, dass ich zum Polizisten sage âArschloch, alles klarâ
Ich bin nur am Rauchen, trinke viel zu viel
Bin schnell abgelenkt, wenn die Leute mit mir diskutieren
Und man, glaub mir, es schmeckt nicht, wenn ich dir was koch'
Doch habe wenigstens die Nummer von dem Pizzamann im Kopf
Ich mache immer einen auf krass
Und bin einer von den Coolen
Doch ist einer stÃ¤rker, kack ich ab und ruf' die Bullen
Falls wir etwas trinken gehen
Kommen von mir nur blÃ¶de Ausreden
Wie ""Ich hab mein Portmonnaie verloren, du musst mir auslegen""

Man sah uns beide jeden Abend durch den Kiez gehen
Und schon da sagtest du, du suchst nach einem der dich reich macht
Und du bist gegangen, weil ich's einfach nich' gepeilt hab
Du hast mich oft nach meim' Masterplan gefragt
Genau so oft hab ich dir gesagt, dass ich keinen habe
Ins erste Studio hab ich investiert, tausend Mark
Jenny ich mach Mukke jetzt, Jenny hat mich ausgelacht
Drauf gekackt, ich mach es klar und werde Rap-Star
Ich wollte dir beweisen, dass du damals nich' im Recht warst
Und ich habe auf die Schule geschissen
Statt im Unterricht wollte ich im Studio sitzen
In mein Reim-Buch reinschreiben
Ich dachte, irgendwann wirst du dich wieder bei mir einschleimen Jenny
ZwÃ¶lf Jahre is' das her
Und was ich dir jetzt sagen werde fÃ¤llt mir wirklich schwer, doch ich sag's Jenny

Du hast immer gesagt
Dass nix aus mir wird und du hattest Recht, Jennifer
Ich bin immer noch broke
Die gleiche Wohnung und das gleiche Bett, Jennifer
Ich leb in den Tag
Hab nix gelernt und hab kein' Cent auf Tash, Jennifer
Jennifer ey
Und ich geb es gerne zu Jenny, Jenny du hattest Recht
Jennifer, Jennifer (yeah)
Jenny du hattest Recht

Mein erster Auftritt beim Sommer-Fest, nix reimt sich
Ich hab von A bis Z verkackt, ich war dir echt peinlich
Ich wollt ein Star sein, Haufen Geld haben und Videos dreh'n
Doch hatte nich' mal Geld um mit dir ins Kino zugehen
Auf dem Pausenhof mit den Jungs freestylen
Paar Lines war'n cool, Jenny konnt' es nie leiden
In dein' Augen gab's kein Ziel fÃ¼r mich
Ich musste immer wieder verstehen, denn sie fÃ¼hlt es nich'
Du hast mir pausenlos die Wahrheit auf die Nase gebunden
Und deine Ignoranz is' auch nich' mit den Jahren verschwunden Jenny
Denn heut hast du 'n Mann der 'n guten Job hat
Einen der was auf der Tasche und auch was im Kopf hat
Und ich wohn jetzt wieder bei mein' Eltern
Es hat nich' ganz gelappt, so wie ich mir das vorgestellt hab
Jenny, zwÃ¶lf Jahre alles gleich
Und was ich dir jetzt sagen werde fÃ¤llt mir echt nicht leicht, doch ich sag es Jenny

Doch Jenny ich kann nix dafÃ¼r
Auch meine Eltern haben's satt
Und setzen mich bald vor die TÃ¼r

Und ich bleib der den keiner kennt
Ich hab wohl wirklich kein Talent
Ich hab es in den Sand gesetzt

So I'mma go for mine (so son, go for yours)
Yo I'mma go for mine (so son, go for yours)

[El Sha]
My crew be in the mix, like name brand kicks
The kids that only deal wit that type of nonsense
You can't get wit, D.K.S. self evident
Adolescence, reign the supreme court, in any, every, meant

[Lil Knock]
The time was approximately eleven forty three
When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O see K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'mma hold it down, wit sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties

[El Sha]
My lyrics oppose a threat to the best M.C. yet
And appears nightmares for those who slept
Also the biters, claimin they writers
They need to think about what they talk about
When you exposin your dirt, that's when you dummin out
Dwellin in the PJ's, all day, hangin out wit nothin to do
Them rebellin niggas is mad, 'cause I'm tellin the truth
Hittin yo wit mind craftin, flows to molecular cord graphin

[Chorus 2X]

[Lil Knock]
Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil are-you-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin M-I-see
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book wit my lyrics I'm endin this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin in my ears
Fuckin ejected, he can't hang wit my style
Look now, here's man fillin it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin, I'm not playin
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin, lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'cause I will be sure to end whatever you created

[El Sha]
Mentally you can't function
Physically you dead wit the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin, from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin about walkin, to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin about ""Where the two glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do wit my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick wit the mic device""
Drivin off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

[Break]
So who's the crew that give nightmares to those who slept (D.K.S.)

And they don't come around at all
Unless you got that lucky touch

Yes, and I remember Shannon
And her sunset orange hair
And I remember river banks
And love so soft and fair

But I left her for a sunrise 
That I have never seen
And saw instead a bottle
Now my whole life's a dream

Yeah, but many men have walked 
Down an unlucky road
And many men have worn 
A few holes in their soul

And I know the years have turned me
Just a little cold
Sometimes I just wished 
I might have known

Well he staggers down the sidewalk
Fixed on broken days
He reaches for his bottle, oh
And silently he says

You know them dreams don't go round 
On the wheel of fortune, much
And they don't come round at all 
Unless you got that lucky touch

I could see you crying
Suffer the pain
Like a river drying 
After the rain
You're hiding from the daylight

Deep in a groove
Only walls around you
Nowhere to move
The state I found you
Lonely in the cold night

you're not alone
You're not the only one who hurts
You're not alone
This is the moment of rebirth
I've seen your heartache
I feel the pain you hide inside
You're not alone
Come, let me hold you

castle and sand
There were promises
Futures were planned
You hang onto castle and sand
Suffering from stagefright

you're not alone
You're not the only one who hurts
You're not alone
This is the moment of rebirth
I've seen your heartache
I feel the pain you hide inside
You're not alone
I stand beside you

[and when you walk in the valley of darkness
You will feel you will be left alone
I will stand there and wait right beside you
I will guide you home]

Do what I would do for you
See I'm so confused
Got me stuck on you

Why do I deal with you 
Said I'm a crazy fool
And to stay away from you 
I dissed my family
Just to get next to you
I brought you a cell phone 
Can't even talk to you 
All a brother want for Christmas
Is to have you right back in my life

I mean why
Why'd you have to leave
Put the gifts under the tree
Dissed my family 
I mean why
Baby I had the mistletoe over the door waiting for you
Why'd you have to go
Please come back
If I had one wish for Christmas
It would be to have you back in my life.

Verse 1:

He took advantage of your love

And he threw it all away

He broke your tender heart

Words can't express what you wanna say

But deep inside you know

That there's someone out there for you

Who'll love you tenderly

And turn your gray skies into blue

So tell me girl


Chorus:

Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl?

It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl

Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl

It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl


I know it's hard to start again

To find somebody new

But don't you be afraid

Rough times don't last but true lovers do

As the night follows the day

Some you win and some you lose

But don't give up on love

Sometimes you clear the old to get to the new


Chorus


Let me dry your eyes

I am here for you

You are not alone

I know what you're going through


So sad

Baby girl, oh, baby girl

Wipe your tears away

One kiss I just hate it
One kiss One kiss One kiss

One kiss felt so good
But I never should've had that kiss

I was so far gone
She could do no wrong
Until I caught her in the act
Down right gettin' it on
How could I not see
That eventually she would break my heart
Where did it all start
It started with a little bitty kiss

Mistook that kiss for kindness
How could I be so blinded
Should've ran instead I
Made it easy 
But I won't let my heart get hurt

Was taught to me by one kiss

For the first three yrs
We was on coat fax
No deals no money
But everybody had our back
We know it would happen and that's for a fact
Until then we were just watching Cosbys in the laundry mat
Scrounging up change for a pizza guy
No ride to Roscoe's
We made our own sunrise
Getting sick off cheetos
Skittles and benekos
Mark yelling cause we eat his last tacito

Wishing for a bank account with at least to zeros
Playing ball all day
Sharing one Gatorade
No dogs of our own
So we walked Bear and Jane
Playing B-B bridges
Hopping over gates
Just to go swimming
Yeah we was bad
Trying to holler at all the women, huh
Man
Times where hard
You know we didn't get to much
But we always had each other man that was enough

No matter what goes down
Were still friends til the end

Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
Ya heard

It's getting hard now
What are we to do now
Years are passing
Its time to make moves now
We got our act together
Faced the bad weather
Told ourselves it was either now or never
So we grabbed our stuff and
Started shopping at labels
Perform demos and did whatever it takes
Damn every label slammed the door in our face
But we kept our heads up until we found the right place

But we still here
No matter what goes down
Were still friends til the end

Yeah that's a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
Ya heard

We found a home now
It's on 
We in the game now
Chris and Max done made this thing crack now
Now we work with Tommy and Polly with Dee Mack now
Took us a while but we got a name now
A platinum album with dough up in the bank now
No more lounging around, we businessmen now
Epic helped us and put us in the right gear
Video and radio thanks for the great year
I'm glad the time that it took was a struggle
So that when this time came we would be grateful and humble
We thank God for making all this happen for us
We thank all our fans for having love in us
Come on

We light the fire

It's Christmas Eve

Welcome to the table for some holiday fare

As we join our hands

In Christmas prayer

I'm so glad the season is finally here

Our house is nice& full like it was last year

Nothing feels better than Christmas cheer

When everyone's home for Christmas Eve

Colorful lights

Are seen everywhere

Sleigh bells

Little ones know

So,let's grab our coats and sing along

Come on,come on,come on

This year was too sick
Santa Claus got me that 6
with that doubled out kit
Too clean, fresh white, gangsta lean
You know how I do, when I get on the scene
Santa Claus, ""SC"" is what I call his name
He give me too much I think Santa got crazy
But anywayz, thank you for all the giftz
I left them hot cookiez, but just dun forget it

Now Christmas is my favorite time of year
I got red forces with red Polo gear
Red Chanel ski hat, plus a Cadillac
With diamond in the back
Sittin on the scene with shiny gold D's
Oh
Ice crush soda can
Chrome on the left hand
and a walkman-you got a walkman
When I get all this 
Man I thought it wuz great!
But I wuz bad this year 
So Santa made a mistake

There they go it's them ghetto superstars
The latest throw backs and the ones on my feet

When you and I was so happy together every way
But now, reminiscing
I can see the signs was right in front of my face
So I guess, you was right the fault's mine

Say you loved me, whatever
So completely, whatever
I see you was wrong but guess what, baby

I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me? No
You and me, we got a special thing
I can't let you go, no

One more time, girl, you know I got chu
You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything, be the man you want me to be
You're everything, you know I love you

Girl, I love you, come on now, girl
Lemme show you, I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face

I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Now I've found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

Come on, tell me how does it make you feel
To know I don't need your love? I'm happy for you
Come on, tell me how does it make you feel
To know that he hot? You're not
I'm happy for you, I'm telling you, fool

I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you

Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

Baaba Maal,"The agouyadji is sounding
Able bodied men rise up
In today's world, honor is becoming rare
So let us examine our consciences
And seek to refine our race

Our language is not the least important factor
In our dignity
So let us learn it and let us teach it
That will pay off

From here to the Fouta, Poular is spoken
From Somalia to Mali
From Benin to Guinea
From Cameroon to Gambia
From Egypt to Ethiopia, they speak Poular

If all these people came together
They'd know we have the same mother
Whatever the difference in our dialect
We have the same father

I called Coumba and Coumba replied
I called Samba, Samba replied likewise
I used to believe those of us who speak Pulaar
Were inferior, but I realized I was wrong
Let us be united

From whichever part of the country we come
We are all Senegalese
If you go to Casmance, they speak Diola
Go to Cap Verde, and you'll hear Lebou
In St Louis, the dialect is Wolof
At Sine, it is Serer

If you address the Senegalese, the Mandinkas will reply
Or the Bassaris, or the Halpoulars
The Kassounkes, the Manjacks or the Gnominkes
Sayang, Sayang, Ibrahima Malick

Malick Barou Sall, you are a good friend
Sayang Sissokho who comes from Mali
Ibrahima Kalilloulaye
Yangkou Ba, my friend from the Gambia

Malick Pathe Sow, father of Pathe Sow
My friend from Senegal
Baaba Baidy, Baaba Debbo from the Fouta
Wherever we come from
We are all Senegalese

Ah, it is late my dearest Mariama Dianke
It is very late Mariama Soda, Mama
Marie don't be cross with me
Dearest one, be careful not to cross me

Peace is all I want
Don't ever take my love for granted
I would never give you my love and then withdraw it
If we break that trust our enemies will laugh at us

For me all I want is peace
Let us be of one mother
Let us have one father
Let us work together
So that our country may prosper

My friend, my little babe

Long life, happiness and prosperity
Then I would live always beside

Those who are dear to me
My parents and my friends
While I was in France
Learning more about art and life

One terrible phone call
Summoned me home where I found
My mother was already dead and buried
Orphan, orphan, orphan

Oh Father full of pity

How sacred is the family

Carlo Cokxxx Nutten, sag mir, welches Album hat so AtmosphÃ¤re?
Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand wie 'ne JagdtrophÃ¤e
Ich wurd' berÃ¼hmt, doch war im Ghetto am Start
Denn ein paar Featureparts konnten Mamas Rechnung nicht zahlen
Und wer Beef mit mir wollte, brauchte nur ein falsches Wort sagen
Deutsche Gangsterapper killen ist eine meiner Vorstrafen
Solang man funktioniert, sind sie alle hochzufrieden
Nun dann wurd' ich totgeschwiegen, doch ich war nicht tot zu kriegen
Hab's getan, wÃ¤hrend eure Drohungen nur Drohung blieben
Rap ist mein Haus und du darfst dir keine Wohnung mieten
Keks bellen und denken, so macht man Rapgeld
Aber keiner hat mit 19 auf sein Konto sechs Stellen
Fahrt mal eure Filme und seit endlich zufrieden
Bin ich auch, denn jetzt sind es sieben

Und jetzt komm' wir auf die Sachen, ihr sagt, Rap sei tot
Warum klingt jeder zweite so, als wÃ¤r' er Ek sein Sohn?
Ich traf viele, aber Saad ist ein Ehrenmann

Aah
I want you to know that, I am the man who
Fight for the right, not the wrong
Singin' this and singin' that
Going there, I'm growing there
Soon you will find out the man I'm supposed to be

Aah
This man, don't trouble no man
But if you trouble this man it will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam
What a bam bam, bam bam 
It'll bring a bam bam
Bam Bam, what a bam bam

Aah
This man, don't trouble no man
But if you trouble this man it will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam
What a bam bam, bam bam 
It'll bring a bam bam
It'll bring a bam bam
Bam Bam, what a bam bam
Can you hear that?

Aah
I want you to know that I am the man who
Fight for the right, not the wrong
Singin' this and singin' that
Going there, I'm growing there
Soon you will find out the man I'm supposed to be

Aah
Now can you hear that?

Help this man, don't trouble no man
But if you trouble this man it will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam
What a bam bam, bam bam 
It'll bring a bam bam
Bam Bam, what a bam bam
It will bring a bam bam
It will bring a bam bam
It will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam, what a bam bam

Can you heard that?
