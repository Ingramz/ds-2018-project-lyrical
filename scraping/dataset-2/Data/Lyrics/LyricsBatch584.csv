Yellow hair a-flying through the breeze
Now that the rainstorm is over
The sun's shining down on you and me

Never have I seen such a vision
In my wildest memory
When I wake up in the morning
Your face is all that I see

Oh, won'tcha take me down
To the bend in the river
Hold me close under the willow trees

And tell me, darling
That you'll love me forever
And together we'll set our spirits free

River flowing blue and lazy
Carry my troubles right downstream
Sun hanging low and hazy
Right in the middle of a summertime dream

Now that you're right beside me
Never am I gonna let you go
Feeling so free and easy
Just watching that river flow

Oh, yeah, won'tcha take me down
To the bend in the river
Hold me close under the willow trees

And tell me, darling
That you'll love me forever
And together we're gonna set our spirits free

Take me down
To the bend in the river
Hold me close under the willow trees

And tell me, darling
That you'll love me forever
And together gonna set our spirits free

I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My dad was a poor, hard-working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay

I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand

Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said honey I'm coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history

Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said son you wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim

Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw, Michigan

We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan

I thought my good gal had gone
Well, I woke up this mornin'
She really hadn't done me wrong
I know it's not fair
But my good gal has done caught air

I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can

My gal's been triflin' 'round
About a week I know
Several of my friends
Just told me so and so
She's found a new man
And now I can understand

So I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can

Well, it's true, my baby's gone
I know it won't be long
We'll both be on that train
My baby's comin' home again
She's been triflin' 'round

Lefty Frizzell,"Last night all alone in a Bar Room
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair, and eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table, and as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience a--side

Then we danced and she whispered I need you 
Take me a--way from here and be 
My man
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it

I'm out to make a mil nigga, so I'm ready for war, let's go
Hop in the low, let's jump
What the fuck you runnin' yo' mouth for?
It's Coleone bitch, I'm ready so what you gon' do?
I'm higher than your bedroom, 'bout to stick you like this tattoo
Make a move nigga, you opened them death threats
Better run and hide with your bitch, that'll see your best bet
I'm a psycho, aim for the head when the lead blow
One less nigga, one less stanky hoe
Now who can fuck with me?
The type of nigga that'll grab the gun and say you stuck with me
Got these niggaz up on the run, my bitch bust quickly
So spread out, I'm coming through - wit a pump
Mistakin' my size you best prepare for the funk
Cause I'm a hostile nigga, got my shit cocked
A false move might get yo' punk ass popped
It's Coleone and I'm ready for war
Tryin' to make these hoe cakes not breathe no more

Murder, murder on my mind I'm 'bout to even the score
And it's mando - to catch a nigga slippin' with his pants down
Creep up from the back and peel his cap with about four rounds
I'm furious nigga, these curious niggaz get took
For the own right, greedy ass niggaz must die
I'm a sold-ier, poppin' the pist-al to get my mil
Bitch you want some huh? Oh, you crazy as hell
They call me Coleone, and I can ???? my ??????
But I'm ready for war, let's go
Out the window of a Lexo, wit a .4-4
These niggaz don't want to see me
I'm thugged out, chasin' yo' ass wit a tec-eezie

Da janela do seu quarto
Do portão da sua casa
Fiz paleta e cavalete
E com as lágrimas que não brincaram com você
Destilei óleo de linhaça
E da sua cama arranquei pedaços
Que talhei em estiletes de tamanhos diferentes

E fiz então, pincéis com seus cabelos
Fiz carvão do batom que roubei de você
E com ele marquei dois pontos de fuga
E rabisquei meu horizonte
E era sempre
Não foi por mal
Eu juro que não foi por mal, eu não queria machucar você
Prometo que isso não vai acontecer mais uma vez
E era sempre, sempre o mesmo novamente

A mesma traição
Às vezes é difícil esquecer
Sinto muito, ela não mora mais aqui
Mas então porque eu finjo
Que acredito no que invento
Nada disso aconteceu assim
Não foi desse jeito

E é só você
Que provoca essa saudade vazia

Legião Urbana,"Às vezes parecia que, de tanto acreditar
Em tudo que achávamos tão certo
Teríamos o mundo inteiro e até um pouco mais
Faríamos floresta do deserto
E diamantes de pedaços de vidro
Mas percebo agora
Que o teu sorriso
Vem diferente

Quase parecendo te ferir
Não queria te ver assim
Quero a tua forca como era antes
O que tens é só teu
E de nada vale fugir
E não sentir mais nada
Às vezes parecia que era só improvisar
E o mundo então seria um livro aberto
Até chegar o dia em que tentamos ter demais

Vendendo fácil o que não tinha preço
Eu sei é tudo sem sentido
Quero ter alguém com quem conversar
Alguém que depois não use o que eu disse
Contra mim
Nada mais vai me ferir

É que eu já me acostumei
Com a estrada errada que segui
E com a minha própria lei
Tenho o que ficou
E tenho sorte até depois
Como sei que tens também",Andrea Doria,1986
Legião Urbana,"Aquele gosto amargo do teu corpo
Ficou na minha boca por mais tempo
De amargo, então salgado ficou doce
Assim que o teu cheiro forte e lento
Fez casa nos meus braços e ainda leve
Forte, cego e tenso, fez saber
Que ainda era muito e muito pouco

Faço nosso o meu segredo mais sincero
E desafio o instinto dissonante
A insegurança não me ataca quando erro
E o teu momento passa a ser o meu instante
E o teu medo de ter medo de ter medo
Não faz da minha força confusão
Teu corpo é meu espelho e em ti navego
E eu sei que a tua correnteza não tem direção

Mas, tão certo quanto o erro de ser barco
A motor e insistir em usar os remos
É o mal que a água faz quando se afoga
E o salva-vidas não está lá porque não vemos",Daniel Na Cova Dos Leões,1986

Eduardo abriu os olhos, mas não quis se levantar
Ficou deitado e viu que horas eram
Enquanto Mônica tomava um conhaque
No outro canto da cidade, como eles disseram

Eduardo e Mônica um dia se encontraram sem querer
E conversaram muito mesmo pra tentar se conhecer
Um carinha do cursinho do Eduardo que disse
""Tem uma festa legal, e a gente quer se divertir""

Festa estranha, com gente esquisita
""Eu não 'to legal, não aguento mais birita""
E a Mônica riu, e quis saber um pouco mais
Sobre o boyzinho que tentava impressionar
E o Eduardo, meio tonto, só pensava em ir pra casa
""É quase duas, eu vou me ferrar""

Eduardo e Mônica trocaram telefone
Depois telefonaram e decidiram se encontrar
O Eduardo sugeriu uma lanchonete
Mas a Mônica queria ver o filme do Godard

Se encontraram então no parque da cidade
A Mônica de moto e o Eduardo de camelo
O Eduardo achou estranho, e melhor não comentar
Mas a menina tinha tinta no cabelo

Eduardo e Mônica era nada parecidos
Ela era de Leão e ele tinha dezesseis
Ela fazia Medicina e falava alemão
E ele ainda nas aulinhas de inglês

Ela gostava do Bandeira e do Bauhaus
De Van Gogh e dos Mutantes, de Caetano e de Rimbaud
E o Eduardo gostava de novela
E jogava futebol de botão com seu avô

Ela falava coisas sobre o Planalto Central
Também magia e meditação
E o Eduardo ainda tava no esquema ""escola, cinema
Clube, televisão""

E mesmo com tudo diferente, veio mesmo, de repente
Uma vontade de se ver
E os dois se encontravam todo dia
E a vontade crescia, como tinha de ser

Eduardo e Mônica fizeram natação, fotografia
Teatro, artesanato, e foram viajar
A Mônica explicava pro Eduardo
Coisas sobre o céu, a terra, a água e o ar

Ele aprendeu a beber, deixou o cabelo crescer
E decidiu trabalhar
E ela se formou no mesmo mês
Que ele passou no vestibular

E os dois comemoraram juntos
E também brigaram juntos, muitas vezes depois
E todo mundo diz que ele completa ela
E vice-versa, que nem feijão com arroz

Construíram uma casa há uns dois anos atrás
Mais ou menos quando os gêmeos vieram
Batalharam grana, seguraram legal
A barra mais pesada que tiveram

Eduardo e Mônica voltaram pra Brasília
E a nossa amizade dá saudade no verão
Só que nessas férias, não vão viajar
Porque o filhinho do Eduardo 'tá de recuperação
Ah! Ahaan!

Está em tudo e mesmo assim

Dos mais belos índios

Tivesse força igual

E há ferrugem nos sorrisos

E o que disserem
Meu pai sempre esteve esperando por mim

Minha mãe sempre esteve esperando por mim

Agora meu filho espera por mim

E das palavras que guardei pra ti

Não penso em me vingar
Não sou assim

Vale mais o coração
Já que não me entendes, não me julgues
Não me tentes

Quero lhe ver
Mas nesse horário você deve estar
Pegando os filhotes no colégio

Fumar unzinho e ouvir Coltrane
Não faço mais isso mas entendo muito bem

Adoro os teus cabelos
Adoro a tua voz
Adoro teu estilo
Adoro tua paz de espírito

O encanador te deixou na mão
Tem reunião do condomínio
O telefone não dá linha
E o chuveiro tá dando choque
Tem uma barata voadora no quarto das crianças
E os monstrinhos estão gritando alucinados
Pra eles tudo é diversão
Mas você sabe o que é ter pavor, pavor, pavor
De baratas voadoras

E você diz daquele seu jeito
""Ai, preciso de um homem!"" 
E eu digo, ah, Leila, eu também!
E a gente ri

Você monta suas fotos pra exposição
Promete trabalhar mais com o computador
E terminar seu vídeo até setembro
Ter que pegar o carro no conserto
Ver a conta do banco, cartão, IPTU
Sábado vai ter peixada na Analú
E domingo, cachorro-quente com as crianças na
Fernanda

Adoro teu olhar
Adoro tua força

Adoro dizer seu nome

Foi até bom mas ao final deu tudo errado
E agora carrego em mim
Uma dor triste, um coração cicatrizado
E olha que tentei o meu caminho
Mas tudo agora é coisa do passado
Quero respeito e sempre ter alguém
Que me entenda e fique sempre a meu lado
Mas não, não quero estar apaixonado

A paixão quer sangue e corações arruinados
E saudade é só mágoa por ter sido feito tanto estrago
E essa escravidão e essa dor não quero mais
Quando acreditei que tudo era um fato consumado
Veio a foice e jogou-te longe
Longe do meu lado

E tanto faz de tudo o que ficou guardo um retrato teu
E a saudade mais bonita
Eu não me perdi e mesmo assim ninguém me perdoou
Pobre coração, quando o teu estava comigo era tão bom

Não há palavras para explicar o que eu sinto
Mesmo que tenhamos planejado
Um caminho diferente

Beba desse sangue imundo
E você conseguirá dinheiro
E quando o circo pega fogo
Somos os animais na jaula
Mas você só quer algodão-doce
Não confunda ética com éter
Quando penso em você eu tenho febre
Mas quem sabe um dia eu escrevo
Uma canção pra você
Quem sabe um dia eu escrevo
Uma canção pra você
É complicado estar só
Quem está sozinho que o diga
Quando a tristeza é sempre o ponto de partida
Quando tudo é solidão
É preciso acreditar num novo dia
Na nossa grande geração perdida
Nos meninos e meninas
Nos trevos de quatro folhas

Já brigamos tanto, mas não vale a pena
Vou ficar aqui
Com um bom livro ou com a TV
Sei que existe alguma coisa incomodando você

Feche as janelas
Apague a luz

Ver a leveza das coisas com humor

E só hoje e isso passa
Só me deixe aqui quieto

Você não viu
E eu não senti

Você sorriu, ficou e quis me provocar
Quis dar uma volta em todo mundo

Seu interesse é só traição
E mentir é fácil demais

Legião Urbana,"Estou cansado de ser vilipendiado, incompreendido e descartado
Quem diz que me entende nunca quis saber
Aquele menino foi internado numa clínica
Dizem que por falta de atenção dos amigos, das lembranças
Dos sonhos que se configuram tristes e inertes

Como uma ampulheta imóvel, não se mexe, não se move, não trabalha
E Clarisse está trancada no banheiro
E faz marcas no seu corpo com seu pequeno canivete
Deitada no canto, seus tornozelos sangram
E a dor é menor do que parece

Quando ela se corta ela se esquece
Que é impossível ter da vida calma e força
Viver em dor, o que ninguém entende
Tentar ser forte a todo e cada amanhecer
Uma de suas amigas já se foi
Quando mais uma ocorrência policial

Ninguém me entende, não me olhe assim
Com este semblante de bom samaritano
Cumprindo o seu dever, como se eu fosse doente
Como se toda essa dor fosse diferente, ou inexistente
Nada existe pra mim, não tente
Você não sabe e não entende

E quando os antidepressivos e os calmantes não fazem mais efeito
Clarisse sabe que a loucura está presente
E sente a essência estranha do que é a morte
Mas esse vazio ela conhece muito bem
De quando em quando é um novo tratamento
Mas o mundo continua sempre o mesmo

O medo de voltar pra casa à noite
Os homens que se esfregam nojentos
No caminho de ida e volta da escola
A falta de esperança e o tormento
De saber que nada é justo e pouco é certo
De que estamos destruindo o futuro

E que a maldade anda sempre aqui por perto
A violência e a injustiça que existe
Contra todas as meninas e mulheres
Um mundo onde a verdade é o avesso
E a alegria já não tem mais endereço
Clarisse está trancada no seu quarto

Com seus discos e seus livros, seu cansaço
Eu sou um pássaro
Me trancam na gaiola
E esperam que eu cante como antes
Eu sou um pássaro
Me trancam na gaiola
Mas um dia eu consigo resistir
E vou voar pelo caminho mais bonito

Ao me explicar o que eu não quero ouvir

Ainda não estou pronto pra saber a verdade
Ou não estava até uma estação atrás

Acho que só agora eu começo a ver
Que tudo que você me disse
É o que você gostaria que tivessem dito pra você

Se o tempo pudesse voltar dessa vez
Sou eu mesmo e serei eu mesmo então
E não há nada de errado comigo, não
Não, não, não
Não preciso de modelos, Não preciso de heróis

De uma revolução de merda
De generais e de um exército de merda

Legião Urbana,"João Roberto era o maioral
O nosso Johnny era um cara legal

Ele tinha um Opala metálico azul
Era o rei dos pegas na Asa Sul
E em todo lugar

Quando ele pegava no violão
Conquistava as meninas
E quem mais quisesse ter
Sabia tudo da Janis
Do Led Zeppelin, dos Beatles e dos Rolling Stones

Mas de uns tempos pra cá
Meio que sem querer
Alguma coisa aconteceu

Johnny andava meio quieto demais
Só que quase ninguém percebeu

Johnny estava com um sorriso estranho
Quando marcou um super pega no fim de semana
Não vai ser no CASEB
Nem no Lago Norte, nem na UNB

As máquinas prontas
E um ronco de motor
A cidade inteira se movimentou

E Johnny disse
""Eu vou pra curva do Diabo em Sobradinho e vocês?""

E os motores saíram ligados a mil
Pra estrada da morte o maior pega que existiu
Só deu pra ouvir, foi aquela explosão
E os pedaços do Opala azul de Johnny pelo chão

No dia seguinte, falou o diretor
""O aluno João Roberto não está mais entre nós
Ele só tinha dezesseis
Que isso sirva de aviso pra vocês""

E na saída da aula, foi estranho e bonito
Todo mundo cantando baixinho

""Strawberry fields forever""
""Strawberry fields forever""

E até hoje, quem se lembra
Diz que não foi o caminhão
Nem a curva fatal
E nem a explosão

Johnny era fera demais
Pra vacilar assim
E o que dizem que foi tudo
Por causa de um coração partido

Não façamos do amor
Algo desonesto

Quero ser prudente
E sempre ser correto
Quero ser constante
E sempre tentar ser sincero

E queremos fugir
Mas ficamos sempre sem saber

Seu olhar
Não conta mais histórias
Não brota o fruto e nem a flor

E nem o céu é belo e prateado
E o que eu era eu não sou mais
E não tenho nada pra lembrar

A quem não sabe perdoar
Acho que sempre lhe amarei
Só que não lhe quero mais

Eu só penso em descansar

Já que o tenho sempre a meu lado

Hoje então aceitas pelo nome

They're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you

All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, pretty lies

Three buttons and the thing began to whirl
And a waitress came by a fishnet stockings and a bow tie

Richard, you haven't really changed, I said
That's just now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You've got tombs in your in your eyes, but the songs
You punched are dreaming

Listen, they talk of love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

And he bought her a dish washer and a coffe percolator
And he drinks at home now most night with the TV on

Só por dizer é que finjo que sei

Era o que todos diziam quando ele se perdeu
Deixou pra trás todo o marasmo da fazenda
Só pra sentir no seu sangue o ódio que Jesus lhe deu

Quando criança só pensava em ser bandido
Ainda mais quando com um tiro de soldado o pai morreu
Era o terror da sertania onde morava
E na escola até o professor com ele aprendeu

Ia pra igreja só pra roubar o dinheiro
Que as velhinhas colocavam na caixinha do altar
Sentia mesmo que era mesmo diferente
Sentia que aquilo ali não era o seu lugar

Ele queria sair para ver o mar
E as coisas que ele via na televisão
Juntou dinheiro para poder viajar
De escolha própria, escolheu a solidão

Comia todas as menininhas da cidade
De tanto brincar de médico, aos doze era professor
Aos quinze, foi mandado pro o reformatório
Onde aumentou seu ódio diante de tanto terror

Não entendia como a vida funcionava
Discriminação por causa da sua classe e sua cor
Ficou cansado de tentar achar resposta
E comprou uma passagem, foi direto a Salvador

E lá chegando foi tomar um cafezinho
E encontrou um boiadeiro com quem foi falar
E o boiadeiro tinha uma passagem e ia perder a viagem
Mas João foi lhe salvar

Dizia ele ""estou indo pra Brasília
Neste país lugar melhor não há
'Tô precisando visitar a minha filha
Eu fico aqui e você vai no meu lugar""

E João aceitou sua proposta
E num ônibus entrou no Planalto Central
Ele ficou bestificado com a cidade
Saindo da rodoviária, viu as luzes de Natal

Meu Deus, mas que cidade linda
No Ano Novo eu começo a trabalhar
Cortar madeira, aprendiz de carpinteiro
Ganhava cem mil por mês em Taguatinga

Na sexta-feira ia pra zona da cidade
Gastar todo o seu dinheiro de rapaz trabalhador
E conhecia muita gente interessante
Até um neto bastardo do seu bisavô

Um peruano que vivia na Bolívia
E muitas coisas trazia de lá
Seu nome era Pablo e ele dizia
Que um negócio ele ia começar

E o Santo Cristo até a morte trabalhava
Mas o dinheiro não dava pra ele se alimentar
E ouvia às sete horas o noticiário
Que sempre dizia que o seu ministro ia ajudar

Mas ele não queria mais conversa
E decidiu que, como Pablo, ele ia se virar
Elaborou mais uma vez seu plano santo
E sem ser crucificado, a plantação foi começar

Logo logo os maluco da cidade souberam da novidade
""Tem bagulho bom ai!""
E João de Santo Cristo ficou rico
E acabou com todos os traficantes dali

Fez amigos, frequentava a Asa Norte
E ia pra festa de rock, pra se libertar
Mas de repente Sob uma má influência dos boyzinho da cidade
Começou a roubar

Já no primeiro roubo ele dançou
E pro inferno ele foi pela primeira vez
Violência e estupro do seu corpo
Vocês vão ver, eu vou pegar vocês

Agora o Santo Cristo era bandido
Destemido e temido no Distrito Federal
Não tinha nenhum medo de polícia
Capitão ou traficante, playboy ou general

Foi quando conheceu uma menina
E de todos os seus pecados ele se arrependeu
Maria Lúcia era uma menina linda
E o coração dele pra ela o Santo Cristo prometeu

Ele dizia que queria se casar
E carpinteiro ele voltou a ser
Maria Lúcia pra sempre vou te amar
E um filho com você eu quero ter

O tempo passa e um dia vem na porta
Um senhor de alta classe com dinheiro na mão
E ele faz uma proposta indecorosa
E diz que espera uma resposta, uma resposta do João

Não boto bomba em banca de jornal
Nem em colégio de criança isso eu não faço não
E não protejo general de dez estrelas
Que fica atrás da mesa com o cu na mão

E é melhor senhor sair da minha casa
Nunca brinque com um Peixes de ascendente Escorpião""
Mas antes de sair, com ódio no olhar, o velho disse
""Você perdeu sua vida, meu irmão""

""Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Essas palavras vão entrar no coração
Eu vou sofrer as consequências como um cão""

Não é que o Santo Cristo estava certo
Seu futuro era incerto e ele não foi trabalhar
Se embebedou e no meio da bebedeira
Descobriu que tinha outro trabalhando em seu lugar

Falou com Pablo que queria um parceiro
E também tinha dinheiro e queria se armar
Pablo trazia o contrabando da Bolívia
E Santo Cristo revendia em Planaltina

Mas acontece que um tal de Jeremias
Traficante de renome, apareceu por lá
Ficou sabendo dos planos de Santo Cristo
E decidiu que, com João ele ia acabar

Mas Pablo trouxe uma Winchester-22
E Santo Cristo já sabia atirar
E decidiu usar a arma só depois
Que Jeremias começasse a brigar

Jeremias, maconheiro sem-vergonha
Organizou a Rockonha e fez todo mundo dançar
Desvirginava mocinhas inocentes
Se dizia que era crente mas não sabia rezar

E Santo Cristo há muito não ia pra casa
E a saudade começou a apertar
Eu vou me embora, eu vou ver Maria Lúcia
Já 'tá em tempo de a gente se casar

Chegando em casa então ele chorou
E pro inferno ele foi pela segunda vez
Com Maria Lúcia Jeremias se casou
E um filho nela ele fez

Santo Cristo era só ódio por dentro
E então o Jeremias pra um duelo ele chamou
Amanhã às duas horas na Ceilândia
Em frente ao Lote 14, é pra lá que eu vou

E você pode escolher as suas armas
Que eu acabo mesmo com você, seu porco traidor
E mato também Maria Lúcia
Aquela menina bosal pra quem jurei o meu amor

E o Santo Cristo não sabia o que fazer
Quando viu o repórter da televisão
Que deu notícia do duelo na TV
Dizendo a hora e o local e a razão

No sábado então, às duas horas
Todo o povo sem demora foi lá só para assistir
Um homem que atirava pelas costas
E acertou o Santo Cristo, começou a sorrir

Sentindo o sangue na garganta
João olhou pras bandeirinhas e pro povo a aplaudir
E olhou pro sorveteiro e pras câmeras e
A gente da TV que filmava tudo ali

E se lembrou de quando era uma criança
E de tudo o que vivera até ali
E decidiu entrar de vez naquela dança
Se a via-crucis virou circo, estou aqui

E nisso o sol cegou seus olhos
E então Maria Lúcia ele reconheceu
Ela trazia a Winchester-22
A arma que seu primo Pablo lhe deu

Jeremias, eu sou homem. coisa que você não é
E não atiro pelas costas não
Olha pra cá filha da puta, sem-vergonha
Dá uma olhada no meu sangue e vem sentir o teu perdão

E Santo Cristo com a Winchester-22
Deu cinco tiros no bandido traidor
Maria Lúcia se arrependeu depois
E morreu junto com João, seu protetor

E o povo declarava que João de Santo Cristo
Era santo porque sabia morrer
E a alta burguesia da cidade
Não acreditou na história que eles viram na TV

E João não conseguiu o que queria
Quando veio pra Brasília, com o diabo ter
Ele queria era falar pro presidente
Pra ajudar toda essa gente que só faz

Saindo da rodoviária, viu as luzes de Natal

Meu Deus, mas que cidade linda
No Ano Novo eu começo a trabalhar
Cortar madeira, aprendiz de carpinteiro
Ganhava cem mil por mês em Taguatinga

Na sexta-feira ia pra zona da cidade
Gastar todo o seu dinheiro de rapaz trabalhador
E conhecia muita gente interessante
Até um neto bastardo do seu bisavô

Um peruano que vivia na Bolívia
E muitas coisas trazia de lá
Seu nome era Pablo e ele dizia
Que um negócio ele ia começar

E o Santo Cristo até a morte trabalhava
Mas o dinheiro não dava pra ele se alimentar
E ouvia às sete horas o noticiário
Que sempre dizia que o seu ministro ia ajudar

Mas ele não queria mais conversa
E decidiu que, como Pablo, ele ia se virar
Elaborou mais uma vez seu plano santo
E sem ser crucificado, a plantação foi começar

Logo logo os maluco da cidade souberam da novidade
""Tem bagulho bom ai!""
E João de Santo Cristo ficou rico
E acabou com todos os traficantes dali

Fez amigos, frequentava a Asa Norte
E ia pra festa de rock, pra se libertar
Mas de repente Sob uma má influência dos boyzinho da cidade
Começou a roubar

Já no primeiro roubo ele dançou
E pro inferno ele foi pela primeira vez
Violência e estupro do seu corpo
Vocês vão ver, eu vou pegar vocês

Agora o Santo Cristo era bandido
Destemido e temido no Distrito Federal
Não tinha nenhum medo de polícia
Capitão ou traficante, playboy ou general

Foi quando conheceu uma menina
E de todos os seus pecados ele se arrependeu
Maria Lúcia era uma menina linda
E o coração dele pra ela o Santo Cristo prometeu

Ele dizia que queria se casar
E carpinteiro ele voltou a ser
Maria Lúcia pra sempre vou te amar
E um filho com você eu quero ter

O tempo passa e um dia vem na porta
Um senhor de alta classe com dinheiro na mão
E ele faz uma proposta indecorosa
E diz que espera uma resposta, uma resposta do João

Não boto bomba em banca de jornal
Nem em colégio de criança isso eu não faço não
E não protejo general de dez estrelas
Que fica atrás da mesa com o cu na mão

E é melhor senhor sair da minha casa
Nunca brinque com um Peixes de ascendente Escorpião""
Mas antes de sair, com ódio no olhar, o velho disse
""Você perdeu sua vida, meu irmão""

""Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Essas palavras vão entrar no coração
Eu vou sofrer as consequências como um cão""

Não é que o Santo Cristo estava certo
Seu futuro era incerto e ele não foi trabalhar
Se embebedou e no meio da bebedeira
Descobriu que tinha outro trabalhando em seu lugar

Falou com Pablo que queria um parceiro
E também tinha dinheiro e queria se armar
Pablo trazia o contrabando da Bolívia
E Santo Cristo revendia em Planaltina

Mas acontece que um tal de Jeremias
Traficante de renome, apareceu por lá
Ficou sabendo dos planos de Santo Cristo
E decidiu que, com João ele ia acabar

Mas Pablo trouxe uma Winchester-22
E Santo Cristo já sabia atirar
E decidiu usar a arma só depois
Que Jeremias começasse a brigar

Jeremias, maconheiro sem-vergonha
Organizou a Rockonha e fez todo mundo dançar
Desvirginava mocinhas inocentes
Se dizia que era crente mas não sabia rezar

E Santo Cristo há muito não ia pra casa
E a saudade começou a apertar
Eu vou me embora, eu vou ver Maria Lúcia
Já 'tá em tempo de a gente se casar

Chegando em casa então ele chorou
E pro inferno ele foi pela segunda vez
Com Maria Lúcia Jeremias se casou
E um filho nela ele fez

Santo Cristo era só ódio por dentro
E então o Jeremias pra um duelo ele chamou
Amanhã às duas horas na Ceilândia
Em frente ao Lote 14, é pra lá que eu vou

E você pode escolher as suas armas
Que eu acabo mesmo com você, seu porco traidor
E mato também Maria Lúcia
Aquela menina bosal pra quem jurei o meu amor

E o Santo Cristo não sabia o que fazer
Quando viu o repórter da televisão
Que deu notícia do duelo na TV
Dizendo a hora e o local e a razão

No sábado então, às duas horas
Todo o povo sem demora foi lá só para assistir
Um homem que atirava pelas costas
E acertou o Santo Cristo, começou a sorrir

Sentindo o sangue na garganta
João olhou pras bandeirinhas e pro povo a aplaudir
E olhou pro sorveteiro e pras câmeras e
A gente da TV que filmava tudo ali

E se lembrou de quando era uma criança
E de tudo o que vivera até ali
E decidiu entrar de vez naquela dança
Se a via-crucis virou circo, estou aqui

E nisso o sol cegou seus olhos
E então Maria Lúcia ele reconheceu
Ela trazia a Winchester-22
A arma que seu primo Pablo lhe deu

Jeremias, eu sou homem. coisa que você não é
E não atiro pelas costas não
Olha pra cá filha da puta, sem-vergonha
Dá uma olhada no meu sangue e vem sentir o teu perdão

E Santo Cristo com a Winchester-22
Deu cinco tiros no bandido traidor
Maria Lúcia se arrependeu depois
E morreu junto com João, seu protetor

E o povo declarava que João de Santo Cristo
Era santo porque sabia morrer
E a alta burguesia da cidade
Não acreditou na história que eles viram na TV

E João não conseguiu o que queria
Quando veio pra Brasília, com o diabo ter
Ele queria era falar pro presidente
Pra ajudar toda essa gente que só faz

She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit

For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass

Is it on your back (uh huh)
Is it on your leg (uh huh)
Is it buy your cat (uh huh)
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Liffy Stokes]
Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them ?booshy? hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all 
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold be	's
Cause you really gotta get greedy
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggas out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl

(Chorus)

[Bennie Franks]
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty and here for money grams
It's something bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, X out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everything is on me
Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The Brandi, I can't stand it the way my mess 
And let's get stranded, I kizzel my nizzel fa shizzel 
My cameras handy, bumping to this shit type to break the walls down
In Miami, top notch swallow and keep the ostrich and get up

(Chorus - 2x)

[High Beam]
I guess you with me like a reeeeal
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down 
Made me want to buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass 
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

(Chorus)

[Lenny Hooks]
Sip the cris and light the hydro
Spider chick across the dance flo'
Pimps like them tilt the kango
At the club she shotguns 6-0-0
Straight to the Mo' she came out, her clothes
Tattooed up like her nails ain't gold
I'm searching around like I'm 5-0
I'm bout to put something on it this ain't no tattoo hoe",Tattoo,2002
Legrand Michel et son Orchestra,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?",Pieces of Dreams,1972
Legrand Michel et son Orchestra,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Legrand Michel et son Orchestra,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind,1972

I just can't understand,
Why that you make me, feel uneasy, each and every day.

How you do it, you put me through it, and make me pay.
You can never feel just what I do,
To love and to want you, but to let you go.

Don't you know, don't you know, my heart is talking.
Woman can't you hear it,
Don't you know, don't you know, my heart is talking.

Why is it that you cannot comprehend, 
Nor even bend, around to what I say.
In the beginning I had the belief, or was it the relief,
That you were what I was looking for.
It was an expected surprise,
That look in your eyes, mesmerized by my doubts.
You can never feel just what I do,

Two chairs filled for every five gone to waste
Pantsuit girl gives me a nasty gaze

Walk to the bandstand blow my horn
Nobody knows what we're really here for
Let's take it out hard till they show us the door
It's us against them tonight

She said where's the joy in your delivery
I said maybe there's not supposed to be
Any real joy at all here

As we sit jiving but in a little while
Holding her hair she joined the single file
And walked on down the hall

Play the changes
Make the changes
Hear the changes
Us against them tonight

The owner says he thinks we need some work
Got a place for you, got some roadwork
Laying asphalt on the interstate
Nobody cares and why should they
A white girl in a dashiki says you're all the rage
My friends and I think you're quite the sage
Wear a kofu and a finger gauge
To see which way the wind blows today

Leif Wennerström,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

I couldn't hear you.

I suppose it is the price of falling in love
I suppose it is the price of falling in love

Its the rain that I hear coming
Not a stranger or a ghost
But the quiet of the storm approaching
That I fear the most
Its the pain that I hear coming

Drops to the ground in silence
When my love is near
It's marching through my door now
The stoney cold of lonesome
A bell tolls for my heart
And now my lonesome song will end

'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

O' night when Christ was born, o night divine
O' night, o night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand

It's not time to make a change,
Just relax, take it easy.
You're still young, that's your fault,
There's so much you have to know.
Find a girl, settle down,
If you want you can marry.
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy,
To be calm when you've found something going on.
But take your time, think a lot,
Why, think of everything you've got.
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not.

Over men and horses hoops and garters 
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate 
The Hendersons will dance and sing

Their production will be second to none 
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

In a line, in a song I once heard
In a moment on a front porch late one June
In a breath inside a whisper beneath the moon

There it was at the tips of my fingers
There it was on the tip of my tongue
There you were and I had never been that far
There it was the whole world wrapped inside my arms

And I let it all slip away

What do I do now that you're gone
No back up plan, no second chance
And no one else to blame
All I can hear in the silence that remains
Are the words I couldn't say

There's a rain that will never stop fallin'
There's a wall that I tried to take down
What I should have said just wouldn't pass my lips
So I held back and now we've come to this

And it's too late now

What do I do now that you're gone
No back up plan, no second chance
And no one else to blame
All I can hear in the silence that remains

And if you're ever sad
I'll make you laugh
I'll chase the hurt

And put a smile on my face.

And I'm trying to ignore the hurt.

But I'm telling myself I'll be okay,
Even on my weakest days,

But you turn around and a months gone by,
And you realize you haven't cried.

On restera a la cité a manger des glaces a l'eau
Les yeux rouges on regardera le ciel tard le soir
Et on parlera de quand on sera des stars
On parlera de quand on sera des gens heureux
De la gloire du public et puis des tas de feummeu 
Des vacances des bateau et puis du bon temps
Et de toutes ces choses qu'on nous cache depuis trop longtemps 
On parlera de nos chauffeurs de nos villa
On parlera du jour ou t’épousera Sabrina

Ouais on parle de quand on était des gens heureux
Insouciant quand on partageait tous nos grecs en deux 
Quand on empruntait la voiture au père
Quand on avait même pas les sous pour rentrer
Quand on se battait pour le T de la matter
Comme ils me manquent ces lits superposés
Quand on pensait que l'argent fessait le bonheur 
A présent on sait que seul le bonheur fait le bonheur

Leila K.,"Yo! My name is Dr. Alban, the MD, microphone doctor
This song is dedicated to the people of Africa
Swe Mix gimme some drums
Yo! African people, unite
Come together for the sake of your future
Yo! African people unite

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

Hello Nigeria! That's my Motherland
Coming to Sweden now causin' a hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe, so why be shy?
Why be humble? I just came straight out the jungle
You can't compete with me 'cause you know I got the rhythm

I did it before and I'll do it again, so listen watcha say
Yeah hear my point of view
Not everyone can do this
In fact only a few sophisticated, hardcreated
That's who I am, and you knowI've been waiting
So start pumping make some noise

The Mandika tribe, the Hausa tribe
The Fulani tribe, the Gooya tribe, the Zulu tribe
Mi no live in a house mi live in a tree
Electricity can give you a shock
Mi no smoke no cig mi no take no coke
All me take is a glass of juice

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I'm calling on the big guys from the pyramid top
To join the bits and pieces of our Fatherland Africa
'Cause without boundaries we can move the mountains
Drop your personal individual ambitions
Chase the devil off and purify our Fatherland

Afrikan people, crawl from your vultures
Stand affirm 'cause you are the aura of the mankind
You are the dreams, you are the hope, you are the future
You are the past, you are the grandfather of civilization
That is why A N see wants old dogs to sit

The impossible just takes a little longer
Out of this world and inta another world
The earth is spinning round and there's so much to discover
The African man seems to be everywhere
If there are people in the world
Who knows that right is never wrong
Stop the fire burning in my home Africa

Martin Luther King, Mandela you had a dream
Self evidence and a quality for men
Africa for me and Africa far you de Klerk
It doesn't really matter whether a cat is black or white
What really matter is to catch the mouse
I'd rather do it in an African way
Hello Africa tell me you you're doin'

Mmm, jumping on the mike, it 'cause me a rockin' up affection
When I'm holdin' me a mike, it 'cause me awesome affections
What you say to me, me a fun and me warm
Spend some me a time on the Tresittia dime
Don't you try to follow me you ought to realize what me are
What me a really want, me not fly
No I am just coolin', come on now just set it off

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I have been mourning, I have been grieving
I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes
There's a hottie, hottie wind blowing south to north
Following my head, drying all my plants
If there's a mercy in the clouds
You know right is never wrong

Move the sadist off my back
And stop the fire burning in my home Africa
Here comes the news from the mighty Lord
Transqualation is about to come to Earth
Right, rapping is digging down river, north to south
To let milk and honey flow side to side

My name is Alban, mi is a dentist, mi DJ here, mi DJ there
Mi have a shop on Slojdgatan, Alphabet St. is da name
Mi live in no house, mi live in a flat. electricity can give you a shock
Mi smoke no cig, mi take no coke, all me takes is a glass of juice

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together

Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Leila Pinheiro,"Você é muito mais que eu sou
Está bem mais rico do que eu estou
Mas o que eu sei você não sabe
E antes que o seu poder acabe
Eu vou mostrar como e por que
Eu sei, eu sei mais que você

Sabe você o que é o amor? Não sabe, eu sei
Sabe o que é um trovador? Não sabe, eu sei
Sabe andar de madrugada tendo a amada pela mão
Sabe gostar, qual sabe nada, sabe, não
Você sabe o que é uma flor? Não sabe, eu sei
Você já chorou de dor? Pois eu chorei
Já chorei de mal de amor, já chorei de compaixão
Quanto à você meu camarada, qual o que, não sabe não

E é por isso que eu lhe digo e com razão
Que mais vale ser mendigo que ladrão
Sei que um dia há de chegar e isso seja quando for
Em que você pra mendigar, só mesmo o amor
Você pode ser ladrão quando quiser
Mas não rouba o coração de uma mulher
Você não tem alegria, nunca fez uma canção
Por isso a minha poesia, ah, ah, você não rouba não
Ah, ah, você não rouba não
Ah, ah, você não rouba não",Sabe Você,1994
Leila Pinheiro,"Como num romance
O homem dos meus sonhos
Me apareceu no dancing
Era mais um
Só que num relance
Os seus olhos me chuparam
Feito um zoom

Ele me comia
Com aqueles olhos
De comer fotografia
Eu disse cheese
E de close em close
Fui perdendo a pose
E até sorri, feliz

E voltou
Me ofereceu um drinque
Me chamou de anjo azul
Minha visão
Foi desde então ficando flou

Como no cinema
Me mandava às vezes
Uma rosa e um poema
Foco de luz
Eu, feito uma gema
Me desmilingüindo toda
Ao som do blues

Abusou do scotch
Disse que meu corpo
Era só dele aquela noite
Eu disse please
Xale no decote
Disparei com as faces
Rubras e febris

E voltou
No derradeiro show
Com dez poemas e um buquê
Eu disse adeus
Já vou com os meus
Numa turnê

Como amar esposa
Disse ele que agora
Só me amava como esposa
Não como star
Me amassou as rosas
Me queimou as fotos
Me beijou no altar

Nunca mais romance
Nunca mais cinema
Nunca mais drinque no dancing
Nunca mais cheese
Nunca uma espelunca
Uma rosa nunca
Nunca mais feliz",A História de Lily Braun,1996
Leila Pinheiro,"Vai minha tristeza e diz a ela que sem ela
Não pode ser, diz-lhe numa prece
Que ela regresse, porque eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade a realidade
É que sem ela não há paz, não há beleza
É só tristeza e a melancolia
Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei
Na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços hão de ser, milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com este negócio de você
Viver sem mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você longe de mim
Vamos deixar desse negócio de você viver sem mim",Chega de Saudade,1998

Não importa se você tem chance

O sangue escorre, amor
Os carros passam e espirram jatos d'água

E a vontade que não tenha fim, este sol
É viver, ver chegar ao fim,

E olhar pra esse olhar perdido
Nesse mar azul
Uma onda nasceu, calma desceu sorrindo,
Lá vem vindo

Ela, era ela era ela no centro da tela daquela manhã
 tudo o que não era ela se desvaneceu 
Cristo, montanhas, florestas, acácias, ipês  
Pranchas coladas na crista das ondas, 
 as ondas suspensas no are
 pássaros cristalizados no branco do céu
 e eu, atolado na areia, perdia meus pés
  Músicas imaginei , mas o assombro gelou 
Na minha boca-as palavras que-eu ia falar
 nem uma brisa soprou
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar

  Dia após dia na praia com olhos vazados de já não a ver 
Quieto como um pescador a juntar seus anzóis
 ou como algum salva-vidas no banco dos réus
  Noite na praia deserta deserta deserta, daquela mulher
 praia repleta de rastros em mil direções
 penso que todos os passos perdidos são meus
  Eu já sabia, meu Deus , tão fulgurante visão 
 não se produz duas vezes num mesmo lugar 
Mas que danado fui eu
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar
Saía do mar

É longe o não te achar
Que lindo é o seu perdão
Que festa é o seu voltar
Mas quero que você me fale
Que você me cale
Caso eu perguntar
Se o que a faz tão linda
Foi sua pressa de voltar
Levanta e vem correndo
Me abraça e sem sofrer
Me beija longamente

La historia que no tiene fin
Ni como llegaste a ser la mujer
Que toda la vida pedí

Leiva,"Antes de tres lunas volveré a por ti, 
antes que me eches de menos"". 
Dejaste vías muertas tendidas al pasar, 
nunca te he esperado tanto. 

A un minuto de ti, voy detrás de ti. 
A un minuto de ti, te seguiré. 

El viento se ha calzado sus guantes de piel, 
se entretiene con mi pelo. 
Bebo el agua que viene conmigo, estoy 
estancado en tu reflejo. 

Solamente de ti, gota a gota, 
solamente de ti, veneno y sed. 
Llegaré, solo hasta el umbral. 
¡Qué puedo perder! 
Me atreveré, cuento un paso más. 
No soy como tu. 

A un minuto de ti, voy detrás de ti. 
A un minuto de ti, te seguiré. 

Voy a arder, braceo en espiral, 
me vuelvo a repetir. 
Saltaré, planeo en derredor 
no soy como tú.

El mismo verano los dos
La feria reúne a los viejos
Colegas del 92

El alma volcada en espejos
La piel en un revolcón
A veces sólo silencios
A veces como un ciclón

Y el tiempo nos juntó 
Para luego separarnos
¿cómo decir que no? 
Vamos a matarnos

Morimos en el intento
Ardiendo en conversación
Te leo en los sucesos
""El buitre"" clava otro gol

A veces falta valor

Que reventó nuestros otoños

¿Por qué el adiós se siente en vena?

Queremos lo que envenena

Quemamos las alturas
Besamos el polvo y nos calamos hondo

Colgado de la luna en soledad
El viento nos sacude de verdad
Aquí arriba
Tengo que grabarlo en mi cabeza
Subir al escenario principal
Es todo lo que quise conquistar en la vida

Los ídolos del parque
Los dandys y poetas de bar
A los que vendrán y a los de antes
Deja que sea
Los versos que nos parten
Los lazos que nos van a marcar
Que no mueran nunca los cantantes
Deja que sea

No hay más, si todo lo que viene se va
A golpe a de volante

Tengo que volver a mi planeta
Colgado de la luna en soledad
El viento nos sacude de verdad aquí arriba
Tengo que grabarlo en mi cabeza
Subir al escenario principal
Es todo lo que quise conquistar en la vida",Los Cantantes,2014

I wanna testify.
Got my strength and I got my health you can't buy that with fame or wealth And 
I just wanna testify.
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received.
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me 
Looked around and can't ignore, there's so many things to be thankful for.
And I just wanna testify
I got a joy that comes from within, deep in my soul I feel so content
And I just wanna testify
I searched high and I searched low, to find the answers only Heaven holds
And I just wanna testify
Too much joy, can't keep it to myself, I feel the need to tell somebody else
And I just wanna testify
Gifts of love that we all need, are provided if we only plant the seeds
And I wanna plant the seeds and testify.
I just wanna testify.

Got a job a roof overhead don't live fancy but my family's fed
I wanna testify.
Got my strength and I got my health you can't buy that with fame or wealth And 
I just wanna testify.
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received.
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me 
Looked around and can't ignore, there's so many things to be thankful for.
And I just wanna testify
I got a joy that comes from within, deep in my soul I feel so content
And I just wanna testify
I searched high and I searched low, to find the answers only Heaven holds
And I just wanna testify
Too much joy, can't keep it to myself, I feel the need to tell somebody else
And I just wanna testify

For twenty-two long years
Driving eighteen wheels
Down the road

He was only three away
Before his pension paid
On that cold and rainy day
They let him go

He had Mastercard and Visa
American Express, a brand new car
And a mortgage on his home

Collectors called and treated him
Like he was a thief
And he wondered how
To pull that heavy load

And he pledged his allegiance
And put in his time
Just to lose to a number
On the bottom line

Of a laptop computer
Somewhere in L.A
O' say can you see
He's American made

Now the pedal's to the metal
And he ain't slowin' down
Keepin' faith in pride
He never once gave up

He's got a mint 359
And painted on the side
Is his own name
And the words
""In god we trust""

Yeah, he pledged his allegiance
And put in his time

Got to ring you to I lie
It would have been a great November
It was like our love had been reborn
Can't explain the happiness in her voice that day
It made everything make sense
Even though I never knew your name
Now on every night I dry my weeping eyes

I can't believe you've gone away
Life will never be the same
And ill meet you on the other side
And if I see you will you

Wish that I cud see your face
And ill meet you on the other side
And if I see you will you
Call me daddy

Wish it was a boy or girl
Someone who would change the world
Used to say that you would grow to be my baby boo
She already had it all planned
You would be a perfect match
Raised with a loving hand
I will never know you or hold you within these arms

Sometimes she thinks that she's the one to blame, no
Can someone tell me how to stop her pain?

I'd give my heart and soul just to see you grow

Got your life in front of you,

If he don't understand how you feel,

He says if you love me, love me,
Why won't you just do it now?

Feels like every move I made
Caused that chain reaction

Cruisin' down that avenue
Would change my life forever
Lead me right next to you

What if I never got your name?
Where would I be right now
What if I would have changed my place

In love again cos that was the only one for me

The wind of time is blowing through me

It's all a figment of my mind
In a world that I've designed
I'm charged with cosmic energy
Has the world gone mad or is it me?

I'm the creator of this universe
And all that is was meant to be
So that we might learn to see

And stupidity that we must suss

Nervous tension

Nervous tension
Is an unseen enemy of the human mind
Nervous tension can cause you
To lack confidence in yourself
To lose your concentration
And to be inefficient in your work

Nervous tension can prevent you from relaxing
To spoil your leisure hours
And rob you of the sleep you need at night
Nervous tension

Nervous tension

The purpose of this record
Is to train you in the art of relaxing
Both your mind and your body
Use it regularly

Train your mind through repetition
To follow the suggestions
And then you'll be ready to progress
To side two

The mind remains tense
When it is restlessly
Turning over personal problems
Worrying about financial matters

Or the conflicts of daytime plight
Or fretting over the troubles of the world
A mind so strained and tense
Cannot relax even in sleep

Night passes in uneasy dreams
The body is not refreshed as it should be
But you can overcome this difficulty
If you thoroughly relax your mind
Before you go to bed

Better still, you can learn to relax
From time to time during the day
So that nervous tension never builds up
To an unpleasant degree

Nervous tension
Nervous tension

You will carefully plan your course through life
You will think about your plan
Think about your interests
Think with the pleasure
Of the satisfaction you will feel

As the plan becomes reality
You will firmly imprint in your mind this phrase
""I maintain, at all times
A calm, confident, cheerful state of mind""
You will repeat it aloud to yourself
At least three times daily

You will give your mind and body
The rest they need to restore energy
Very shortly you will no longer
Need to listen to my voice

You will absorb and understand
The suggestions I have given you
And you will learn to give them to yourself

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

They have the power to make a wish come true

Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me

Making sure I'm not in too deep

Keeping versed and on my feet

Sometimes you just get so damn tired 
And things really ain't that cool 
But it's normal  man 
You can't let it slow up your pattern 
Somedays the pressure can really be on you 
And you might not know what to do about it 
You might get a little clausterphobic  
Problems closin' in on ya 
But you just gotta relax  man 
Plan your attack  man 
I mean  we all got struggles 
Though you can't win em all 
'Cause life is hard as granite for some of us 
But you just gotta let it ride, man, and ride with it 
'Cause some things only happen when you let it 
If you lose your head too fast, you might live to regret it 
So listen, man, listen 
So when you feel so way out 
And you feel like there's no way out 
You just gotta open your eyes, man, and rise 
Sometimes you just gotta give thanks when you're walkin' slanted 
Ya can't take your blessings for granted

As good as you can't complain  
But you're still all alone  and it all still seems the same  
Maybe it's not the way and it shouldn't have gone this far  
Willingness and sudden greed made it all that much too hard. 

See me sad; that would make you mad and a hunch that made a pain  
It's true that the way you made me makes me fear a sudden change  
Maybe its a good thing that I'm mad enough to take to heart, 
Meaningless meets sudden ease when i'm picked to play that part.

Len,"What's my name? Biz Markie! (x2)

Hold on, hold on, hold on right here.

Biz Markie...

It was a dream of rock and roll and we're giving gifted time, 
and the funky didn't matter, all just beats and rhymes
So we made a bust on Blackie Street and parked it, and we knew that we had to be as dope as the Ill Fresh Juice-school
There was DJ Swagg, Cut Master Cool B, and my mind was Melly Mel and Biz Markie
We were only and just young, so who would've thought today that we would tell you that it happened this way

All the people in the place rockin' (coast to coast)
Put your best foot forward and (rock the house)
And if your feelin' this you better let me (hear ya shout)

What's my name? Biz Markie!

To my man Biz, it's all for you
Thanks for putting out the records guide the way that you do
You keep going off 'cause you just try to follow so when you broke us down, to our last hip talent
So, you gotta cheer when better chords get near, that's what we're dream of with our samples
There's so many blacky jerkits then there're people on their seats, and it's digitalized beats

All the people in the place rockin' (coast to coast)
Put your best foot forward and (rock the house)
And if your feelin' this you better let me (hear ya shout)

Mr. Dibbs is on the cut, cut, cut

When we were young, we started in the streets, we never thought that there'd be a day that we would be
So when it was time, we made a Biz to jump backs, we laid tracks while the later hours
Now so keep on rockin' 'cause no one beats the Biz, the rest is just the fakers that the way it is
This is going on but you think we should be there, who is Biz (oh he's just a friend)

All the people in the place rockin' (coast to coast)
Put your best foot forward and (rock the house)
And if your feelin' this you better let me (hear ya shout)

'Cause Len'll take you out (x3)

Len'll take you out (x10)

Y'all want more?
I can't hear you, do you want some more?
Okay, let me get it.
Do y'all want some more?
Gather all over here.
Do you all want some more?

I'm gonna try some, so y'all go up.

If you all want some more, I want this side to go hell, and I want this side to go yeah, aight?

One, Two, Three

HELL, YEAH (x10)",Man of the Year,1999
Len,"Its early in the morning and I'm feeling kind of dumb,
I'm tryin real hard but I'm having no fun,
I'm looking all around and everything looks the same,
Its like being the smartest kid in class and having no brain.

Sharons right beside me,
Yeah I feel it too. and if you weren't my little brother id take it out on you,
And d-rock and moves just lost their fat-mad flow,
Its just a matter of time before my brains all broke.

My brains all broken, but I'm feelin alright,
I feel like I'm chokin, but I'm feelin alright,
I'm goin down fast, but I'm feelin alright,
I'm not gonna last, but I'm feelin alright.

Bad days are givin me the creeps,
And when I have them all I want to do is freak,
And sometimes I don't feel really strong
Enough to deal with bad days cause they last too long.

We've been thinking hard and figuring out what to make
Of all this stupid shit that makes you not think straight,
So should we just quit?
No, its not cool to run,
Well you know, I think she's right,
Lets show em how its done.

Cause its not just a matter of straight up holding your ground,
Its all about your crew and the vibe you put down,
So if were all here, what's this about a bad day?
Were not going to take it sitting down, no way.

Sometimes you just get so damn tired

And you might not know what to do about it 
You might get a little clausterphobic  
Problems closin' in on ya 
But you just gotta relax  man 
Plan your attack  man 
I mean  we all got struggles 
Though you can't win em all 
'Cause life is hard as granite for some of us 
But you just gotta let it ride, man, and ride with it 
'Cause some things only happen when you let it 
If you lose your head too fast, you might live to regret it 
So listen, man, listen 
So when you feel so way out 
And you feel like there's no way out 
You just gotta open your eyes, man, and rise 
Sometimes you just gotta give thanks when you're walkin' slanted 
Ya can't take your blessings for granted

Hold on, hold on, hold on right here.

Biz Markie...

It was a dream of rock and roll and we're giving gifted time, 
and the funky didn't matter, all just beats and rhymes
So we made a bust on Blackie Street and parked it, and we knew that we had to be as dope as the Ill Fresh Juice-school
There was DJ Swagg, Cut Master Cool B, and my mind was Melly Mel and Biz Markie
We were only and just young, so who would've thought today that we would tell you that it happened this way

All the people in the place rockin' (coast to coast)
Put your best foot forward and (rock the house)
And if your feelin' this you better let me (hear ya shout)

What's my name? Biz Markie!

To my man Biz, it's all for you
Thanks for putting out the records guide the way that you do
You keep going off 'cause you just try to follow so when you broke us down, to our last hip talent
So, you gotta cheer when better chords get near, that's what we're dream of with our samples
There's so many blacky jerkits then there're people on their seats, and it's digitalized beats

All the people in the place rockin' (coast to coast)
Put your best foot forward and (rock the house)
And if your feelin' this you better let me (hear ya shout)

Mr. Dibbs is on the cut, cut, cut

When we were young, we started in the streets, we never thought that there'd be a day that we would be
So when it was time, we made a Biz to jump backs, we laid tracks while the later hours
Now so keep on rockin' 'cause no one beats the Biz, the rest is just the fakers that the way it is
This is going on but you think we should be there, who is Biz (oh he's just a friend)

Such a nice, plump frame
Wot's 'is name has...

Debts to be erased... 
Think of it as thrift, 
As a gift, 
If you get my drift! 

No? 

Seems an awful waste... 
I mean, with the price of meat
What it is, 
When you get it, 
If you get it... 

TODD: HAH! 
LOVETT:
Good, you got it! 

Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop! 
Bus'ness never better using only pussycats and toast! 
And a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most! 
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste!

Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for! 
LOVETT: Here we are, now! Hot out of the oven! 
TODD: What is that? 

LOVETT:
It's priest. Have a little priest.
TODD:
Is it really good? 
LOVETT:
Sir, it's too good, at least! 
Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh, 
So it's pretty fresh.
TODD:
Awful lot of fat.
LOVETT:

No, y'see, the trouble with poet is

Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, 
But then again, not as bland as curate, either!

And good for business, too -- always leaves you wantin' more! 
Trouble is, we only get it on Sundays! 

Lawyer's rather nice.
TODD:
If it's for a price.

Order something else, though, to follow, 
Since no one should swallow it twice! 
TODD:
Anything that's lean.
LOVETT:
Well, then, if you're British and loyal, 
You might enjoy Royal Marine! 
Anyway, it's clean.
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been! 
TODD:
Is that squire, 
On the fire? 
LOVETT:
Mercy no, sir, look closer, 
You'll notice it's grocer!

For neatness he deserved a nod

Where we met on the Isle of Capri.

She was as sweet as the rose of the dawning,
But somehow Fate hadn't meant her for me,
And tho' I sailed with the tide in the morning,
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri.

Summertime was nearly over,
Blue Italian skies above,
I said, ""Lady, I'm a rover,
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""
She whispered softly, "" 'Tis best not to linger,""
Then as I kissed her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger,
'Twas good-bye to the Isle of Capri.",Isle of Capri,2001

And you kissed me all through the night.

Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Lena,"So still for the longest time
I couldn’t see two steps ahead, I was blind
I, I, I, I could not decide
Well I should die, for true it lead to the life that I wanted

Don’t know if you know but you messed up my space
Just what I needed to move from this place that I wanted
Gave me a reason to open the gate

Made me forget everything I ever knew
You, you, you waited round the bend
A second before and we would never have met, coincidence

Livin’ in a lie, figure that I might
See you in another life

Please don’t you try me this time
Can’t stand me losing my mind
I’m gone, I’ve been searchin’ just to find
Somethin’ that’ll keep me sane while I’m here
Somethin’ I can maintain while I’m here

This has never been a game, I’m sincere
Promise I will never change, I’m makin’ it clear when off is
This is my truth, you heard it here first
We’ve probably been through the absolute worst

Boy, you, this drama, it might not be worth it
But we’re more than worth it and that’s why it hurts
Don’t you listen to words comin’ from anybody else but me
Is this even gonna work? Well we’ll see

Wish it would snow so we could start over
I wanna lay down

I miss you more than usual
I wish it would snow

It’s all I ever think about when the winter comes around
It used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes
Now there’s falling frozen dreams as far as anyone can see
It used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes

I wish it would snow
Wish it would snow to cover our footprints
I wanna lay down
Wanna lay down but no lines are drawn

The glimmer in the icicles
Reminds me of how nice it was
I wish it would snow
All through the day and all through the night
