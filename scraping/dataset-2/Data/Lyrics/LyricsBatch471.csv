Joe Lynn Turner,"Seems like yesterday 
You were in my arms 
And in a special way 
You touched my heart with all your charms. 
Now you're gone 
And I find myself 
Baby, I'm all alone 
And there's no love left. 

 Hey! Hey! 

Don't know why I failed. 
For you I've always cared 
And I did all I know 
To win your love and make it so 
You'd always stay 
But you turned away. 
Honey, what could I say? 
How could you 
How could you do me this way? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and affection. 
Chained cuz your love 
Is my only direction 

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh. 
I've got to make it right 
Somehow it all went wrong 
Somewhere down the line 
The love I lost 
The love I gotta find 
Whoah! and it won't be long 
I've gotta make it right baby 
And carry you tenderly back home. 

I'm chained 
To your love and affection. 
Baby, chained to your love. 
When I hear your name 
How I tremble, how I tremeble, yeah. 
Honey, you know, honey, you know, yeah. 

Now I admit that I 
Haven't been the perfect guy 
For a girl as sweet as you 
But my heart and soul cries out to you. 

One more chance that's all I need 
 I'm gonna make it right, baby, 
Now you just stay won't you stay with me? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and afection. 
Baby, I'm chained cuz your love 
Is my only direction. 
I'm chained
",Chained,1997
Joe Lynn Turner,"I heard the sound of voices in the night
Spellbound, there was someone calling
I looked around, no one was in sight
Pulled down, I just kept on falling
I've seen this place before
You were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I want it to be
I know it's a mystery
Do you remember me on a street of dreams?
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams

There you stood, a distant memory
So good, like we never parted
Said to myself, ""I knew you'd set me free.""
And here we are right back where we started
Soemthing's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Now I know I see what I want it to be
But it's still a mystery

Do you remember me on the street of dreams?
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
You are on every face I see
On the street of dreams

Tell me, have you always been
On the street of dreams?
Will we ever meet again, my friend?
Do you know just what it meant to be
On the street of dreams?
Never know just who you'll see, do ya
On the street of dreams
You can be who you want to be, oh yeah
I can hear you calling me
I can feel you haunting me
Haunting me",Street of Dreams,1997
Joe Lynn Turner,"It's too late
Can't tum back the hands of time
I tried to forget you
But you're always on my mind 
It's too bad
That we never found a way 
I thought it would be easy 
It's getting harder everyday

I'm so far gone
It's more than I can take
'Cause I've had my share of loneliness 
I'm just about to break, baby

I can't face another night
When you're not by my side
A part of me just dies without you 
In my dreams I'll hold you tight 
Can't face another night, no, no

So far away
I was wishing you would call
Don't you know that I need your touch
I1 still can feel it all
Baby, I'm In trouble
The walls are closing in
Can't you see that I'm holding on 
Till I'm with you again, oh

This desperate heart is
reaching out for you
'Cause I've had my share of loneliness
I don't know what to do, baby

I can't face another night
When you're not by my side
A part of me just dies without you 
In my dreams I'll hold you tight 
Can't face another night
When you're not by my side 
How much can I take
I'm just about to break

I can't face another night
When you're not by my side
A part of me just dies without you 
In my dreams I'll hold you tight 
Can't face another night

I can't face another night
When you're not by my side
A part of me just dies without you 
In my dreams I'll hold you tight 
Can't face another night",Can't Face Another Night,1999
Joe Lynn Turner,"When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

Do, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.

Will you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Look out 'cause here she comes.

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

Well do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

Look out

Yes she is.
Yes she is

Joe Lynn Turner,"I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

Walking out on another stage
Another town, another place
Sometimes I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight
People keep telling me it's bad for my health
But kicking back don't mke it
Out of control, I play the ultimate role
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

I'm living on an endless road

Joe Lynn Turner,"Have you seen her?
So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree

Oh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way?
Oh, baby baby
Ah come on take a chance
You're old enough to

Dance the night away
Whoa-oh (ah) come on g-girl, dance the night away

A live wire, barely a beginner
But just watch that lady go
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than-uh
Anything else she knows

Oh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way?
Oh, baby baby
Well don't skip romance 'cause

Dance, dance, dance the night away ah, ha ow",Dance the Night Away,2000
Joe Lynn Turner,"Every night I have the same old dream
'Bout you and me and what's in between
So many changes, so many lies
Try to run, try to hide
From everything that I feel inside
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell

Another dark and empty night
If I was wrong I wanna make it right
But you are so distant, so far away
Your words like ice fall on the ground
Breaking the silence without a sound
Oh, familiar strangers with nothing to say
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
You leave me stone cold

Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
You're stone cold, yeah
I can't break away from your spell
Stone cold, baby
I thought I knew you so well
You're stone cold, ice cold
Can't break away from your spell
(You put me in the deep freeze)
(Oh, baby, don't you leave me)

Stone cold, I thought I knew you so well

It's the modern day Ice Age 
The world's frozen, turned front page 
Cats with icy bloodstreams in the rage 
Thirty-two degrees below poverty, feds drug raid 
and lock you in a cage where it's cold, the Ice Age 

[Myalansky] 
Peace to freed jail cats come home, now they cop ranges 
Hand to hand shoot outs with mack, new on the block stranger 
Caught up in VA, New York language 
Miami niggas had these projects locked till the knox raided 
Holdin ball, paint job, the top flavor 
What up my nigga? Rock the gold teeth grill, bally some dark suede gear 
Twenty dollar bill mixed with speed ball 
Teen team burn, finger firey red, makin the king fall 
Incarceration, as an incarconsist is your education 
150 gats with clip, arsonists in the makins 
Slight back your moon roof, gimme some liquer straight no prune juice

Case can't face it, house arrest, I shake the gates 
and give up for flesh, money long, Sonny singin funny songs 
The street songs, faggot at arms, retire firearms 
Lamb skin, master craftsman, just stay flashin 
Mashin, chest burnin from a thug passion 
I tilt bottles up in the club, fuckin with dick models 
Dick throbbin, Haley's comet, 2G will ever aristotle 
Extort cream near the Fort Green, Cali palm trees 
Clam stee, Vietnam fleet, ya scream 'fore I bomb thee

That's icy medallions with a icy bloodstream 
Rip shit with platinum niggaz, that blew off Ice Cream

P rocked some much ice, we called him iceberg 
He touched an iceberg, how did that benz waggin hit that iceberg? 
Now the word's out about Wu-Syndicate, ice heist a lease 
On pyramids, ice men gave dominicans ice keys 
I see quality, bitches suckin' dick with icys for ice rings

I need an igloo in Alaska to escape Lucifer's sting

Joe Mafia,"[Joe Mafia]
It all started with snortin up D
Breakin in apartments, rollin in stolen cars
Stickin dicks, trickin in strip bars
Fly niggaz, whips tinted, switch it up, cop granted
Onslaught twisted, Bougard in the Clark, ripped sinned
Sudafed heads bent over when they sniffed it
Project song, birds tempted while the D's skipped it
Now add it up, jungle younger days, my head is struck
from after buck, the Hollywood swingin in Eddie Bauer truck
Close cuts, devious Devastator hot tracks bang
Very marvelous hearts string, wobbly dart sting
Melody, plated in gold, but hold the legacy
Destiny, to the death of me, roll with Killa Bees

[Chorus (x2): Joe Mafia]
Metropolis ghetto politics, mob hits
Thug logic is hot, I can't stop it
It's easier to knob and hard to knock two
City lights, gettin busy like J. lockin who

[Joe Mafia]
Benevolent, shine fluorescent, produce novelist transcripts
The power surge cut the lights out, save all that shit for the fuckin birds
Murder is Texas, asserted to death, perverted the skets
You confer with nothin less, the quick death
Get the head gased, dead fast, ready rock, hand cock
I shit your whole cast and I ain't dyin for friends
Onyx dense, instead of slugs, dunn, I'd rather drop jems
from fake thugs frontin, I'm not him
Since my life worth nothin, I'm not him don't get it confused
I hold peace but got a short fuse, so watch your mouth dude
In ghost towns, no white sheets, dunn, nice
when on the mic piece, 3 points stance with metal cleets
I tackle the track, a battle cat
Leave the grade off the wall, mad mafia rap, cannibal impact
I rattle clicks and I ain't havin shit, I'm emphatic wish
Strategic war tactics you lack, murder one element

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
It all floors from the source, abort the cause of this
Corporates you could take an add-on, puffin some ?
Snake bite, venomous peak game with the swiftness
Crack vile smile, stuff my hand shakes, fuckin with grinches
Higher cake look, it's easier with hooks
Pipes grillin mafia, but you shook with it sunnin who
My team spitted, niggaz on some petty ass pleads
stoppin for murder reps, I plnat my lice fan on the streets
Stretch, escapin death with every step, hold my own weight
Control fate, plus with sole mate, on some mistakes
And who bets on who bubble gates, my mental beyond moets and cristal
I'm poppin high burnin pistols and need no switch dials
Dealin with cats lustin for scraps, whippin hustle cracks
We block jostle, fuckin with rats, rollin out welcome mats
It's hellbound, bustin my crown, seven point five
Known to get live, conquer new land, I will survive

[Chorus (x2)]",Metropolis,1999
Joe Mag,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.

Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

You're a different space and time
Come to me.
Feel like I'm home
In a place I used to know
Long ago
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that I once knew
Is it you
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that might come true
Shining through

I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja vu
This is devine
I've been waiting all my life
Filling time
Looking for you
Nights were more than you could know
Long ago

Come to me now
We don't have to dream of love
We know how
Somewhere before
It's as if I've loved you so
So long ago

Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where theyd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve oclock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

Ill forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
Ill live a lush life in some small dive...
And there Ill be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1971

Wearing nothing but a button and a bow, wo, wo
Singing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe, wo, wo
She let her hair down and
She did the hoochie, koochie real slow, wo, wo

When she did her special number on a zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show, wo, wo
Singing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She did a triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Saying, Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty nine

Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore, wo, wo
She's too busy mopping and
A taking care of shopping at the store, wo, wo

While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

Joe Nichols,"I know that there's nights I stay out too late
And time I forget to call
It's true I might argue at the drop of a hat
Or make a big deal out of nothing at all

I'm not much for rules but I'm faithful and true
She knows on the inside I'm good
What she sees in me ain't half as important
As what she overlooks

And I wouldn't blame her if she said goodbye
'Cause she ain't like nobody else
And I must be the luckiest man alive
'Cause she loves me in spite of myself

I know she must wonder if she made the right choice
And sometimes I wonder too
It must be hard watchin' a man like me
Trying to make all of her dreams come true

I promised the moon and the stars in the sky
On the night that she promised her love
And I haven't come through though I'm trying to
She says that's more than enough
",In Spite of Myself,1996
Joe Nichols,"I pulled out in a dusty cloud on a hot night in July
With big tears rollin' down she waved goodbye
Just out of my teens with foolish dreams and big stars in my eyes
And now I've had a million second thoughts of what I left behind

I wonder what she's doin' back in old Cheyenne
Does she ever dream of me and how it might have been?
Looking back I was such a fool, I held her love in the palm of my hand
I had it all back in old Cheyenne

That final show, that buckle of gold, it never came to me
I'm far from the hero I thought I'd be
A rollin' stone in the rodeo that's not what I had in mind
And now there's more than these old broken bones breakin' here tonight

I wonder what she's doin' back in old Cheyenne
Does she ever dream of me and how it might have been
Looking back I was such a fool, I held her love in the palm of my hand
I had it all back in old Cheyenne

I'm bluer than the Rocky Mountains
Lonesome as a northern wind
And what I'd give to hold her once again

I wonder what she's doin' back in old Cheyenne
Does she ever dream of me and how it might have been
Looking back I was such a fool, I held her love in the palm of my hand
I had it all back in old Cheyenne

Well she could say goodbye but she won't
Why she loves me I'll never know

Joe Nichols,"My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts with a quick turn of his wrench
And he pulled splinters from his hand and never even flinched
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that Grandpa died I realized

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think'll never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year, Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch they brought the helicopter in
Billy couldn't feel his legs, they said he'd never walk again
But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed
And the day we graduated he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends

I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over, don't give up on you and me

Of bein' let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone

Did you ask her to dance
Let me guess, she told you no
Got to take her some place quiet
And see how far that goes
Oh, don't take it all that hard

Sat and stared into yesterday
I sat down beside him and said

All at once the clouds rolled back and there stood Jesus Christ in all his glory
And I realized the saddest eyes I'd ever seen were lookin straight at me

I guess I was awakened by the penetrating sound of my own screaming

I swung that bat with all my might

Was the only homer that I ever had

Keep your mouth shut and we'll cut you in

Instead of all these honeys runnin' in and out""

Like she ain't got enough of her own business
Now she's got to go mindin' mine
I don't have a lotta kids and a Mrs.

It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and steal a kiss sometime
It ain't no crime

If everybody minded their own business
They'd be too busy to worry 'bout mine
If I live life the way I wanna live it

Or steal a kiss from a girl I will every time

We'll make some make-up love,
While we apologize.
But tonight, let's get drunk and fight!

And get good and torqued down

I was praying it was me

Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all you're cooking

Slide down the hallway in your socks
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sing through your nose in a bubble bath

My oh my, you're so good looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all you're cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking

I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know

Eat a box of chocolate 'cause you're feeling bad
Do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails?
And call up mama when all else fails

Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked then the shades are down
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right or you're thinking of me

Son you spent a small fortune on liquor and beer""

Joe Nichols,"Sun-burned and wonderin', how I wound up here
Edge of a dock, one flip flop, half of a six-pack of beer
Seems like yesterday I was sittin' on top of the world
And I watched it all just drive away
No truck, no boat, no girl.

Layin' out there on that water, is where we ought to be
Instead I'm stuck with no ride home and no you here with me
Seems like yesterday I was sittin' on top of the world
All it takes is one mistake,
No truck, no boat, no girl.

If I could I'd drive a line and catch a bite to eat
Put my zip-code in my tackle box there behind the seat

Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere, sunny and 75

Your face in the crowd, turning away from me

How do we fall apart, without asking ourselves why?

Looking back I can't help thinking
That somewhere I had just stopped running
I would have held you close, and never said goodbye

If we should meet, just walk on by

Let it go without a fight

Easy, easier now 
So easy, it's easier now

Run away from the fight 
Used to face the struggle

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.

Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief

As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp and in its song

'Cause summer is dying; they know that in my heart
There's no gladness because there's no you

The park that we walked in, the garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall

Our favorite nook in the wall

In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
Never more will I say, ""There's no you""

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1992
Joe Pass,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots And Moonbeams,1992

Conflict of interest
You're split right in two
Your convictions lie between
Your shadow and you
When I need help and I'm heading your way
Both of your halves turn the same shade of grey
Conflict of interest...

Here I am alone on the street
With hundreds of people whose eyes never meet
The looks that I get are to say
The least strange
This social disorder-some things never change.

Chorus:
Take a number
Get in line
Hurry up and take your time
Don't make waves you'll be just fine
Make sure your interests don't
Conflict with mine

Every day is the same
When you scream outrages all I say is tame
You stumble blindly I don't really care.
It's my street, too, so stay
Outta my hair

Really drives me up the wall

When I'm with you, baby
I'm like putty in your hands
Mold me, hold me.
Do everything you can
I just got to have
A little more of your love.
I swear you must have been sent
From heaven up above

Keep me satisfied

Honey, when you do me
Do the things you do
I just can't help myself

You keep on giving it

I know one thing for sure
You really make me hot.

Baby, can't you feel me heart beat

Suzie, mother, housewife scrubs the floor
Always drives the kids to school
Never keeps her husband waiting for a meal
Such a deal

He goes on a bender, she stays home
Waiting for another fight
The booze is in the bedroom mirror never faid
She's afraid

We got our women in chains
Women in chains
What good are women in chains?
Isn't it strange, people are afraid to change
We got our women in chains

You don't have to wear your cuffs tonight
You don't have to be a slave
You don't have to buy your freedom with your pain
It's a shame

We got our women in chains
Women in chains
What good are women in chains?
Isn't it strange, people are afraid to change

We got our women in chains

Isn't it strange, people are afraid to change

He knows every song of love that ever has been sung.

No, not even the Chief of Police.

Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
I can smell something cooking,
I can tell there's going to be a feast.
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
He'll put both his arms around you,

Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Wanna get married? Do it now,
Tomorrow all activity will cease.

Pretty the pictures, work to the bone

Include your lovers, include the one

Conflict of interest
You're split right in two
Your convictions lie between
Your shadow and you
When I need help and I'm heading your way
Both of your halves turn the same shade of grey
Conflict of interest...

Here I am alone on the street
With hundreds of people whose eyes never meet
The looks that I get are to say
The least strange
This social disorder-some things never change.

Chorus:
Take a number
Get in line
Hurry up and take your time
Don't make waves you'll be just fine
Make sure your interests don't
Conflict with mine

To my jaded eyes
Every day is the same
When you scream outrages all I say is tame
You stumble blindly I don't really care.
It's my street, too, so stay
Outta my hair

Really drives me up the wall
You got me spinning round and round

When I'm with you, baby
I'm like putty in your hands
Mold me, hold me.
Do everything you can
I just got to have
A little more of your love.
I swear you must have been sent
From heaven up above

Chorus:
Keep me satisfied
Keep me satisfied

Honey, when you do me
Do the things you do
I just can't help myself
I'm so in love with you
You keep on giving it
Everything that you got
I know one thing for sure
You really make me hot.

Baby, can't you feel me heart beat

Tell me why do I have this doubt?

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me

[Chorus 2]
I'm know your alibis are watertight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell  
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
Slippin' away from me

Your telephone service says you're out again.
Somewhere, out there, you've got another rendezvous
I know the way you work
You'll be someplace where no one can check up on you
You think you're in the clear but don't forget
That's exactly the way we met

Tell me why do I have this doubt

Joe Posada,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,2001

Foot on the pedal

Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job
It's a damn good time
City to city I'm running my rhymes.
On location
Touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger
But a stable turntable
I do what I do best
Because I'm willing and able.
Ain't no faking
Your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast to watch all the girlies shaking.
While you're at the job working nine to five

Getting paid along the way

Four on the floor Ad-Rock's out the door

Autograph pictures and classy hoes

Joe Pullum,"I never believed in dreaming, it never got me very far.
I never believed that love could find me, like an arrow through the heart.
I never believed in miracles, or building castles in the air.
Not until that day I found you, turned around and you were there.
From the day you came, you gave me, a whole new point of view.
I've been touched by an angel, it's impossible, but true.

I believe in you.
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
I believe in you.
And I believe our love will last always.

I never believed in fairy tales, tho sometimes I wish I could,
I never believed that golden slippers could ever find the perfect foot.
I never believed in magic, or that wishes could come true,
But your very kiss changed all this, something only you could do.
You made me a believer, you made me trust again,
You showed there's a pot of gold, at every rainbow's end.

I believe in you.
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
I believe in you.
And I believe our love will last always.

Only love, sets you free, 
And if you serve to fate, then you're my destiny.
Now I know, now I see.
Anything can happen, if you just believe.

I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.

Joe Puma,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1957
Joe Puma,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
