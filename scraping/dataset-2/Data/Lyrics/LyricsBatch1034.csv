Spearhead,"""Ya know one day the indigenous people of the
Earth are gonna reclaim what's righfully
There's.""
""Really? Uh oh!""

Lose your mind misplace your mind
Forgot you even had a mind
'Cause someone told you it's impossible
To change your mind
A friend of mine made it to twenty-five
We had a celebration ""man I'm glad that you're alive""
I'm happy to see my man you're beatin' the odds
And for this on this day we give thanks to the gods
'Cause everyone deserves a shot except you only get one
I hope it's not through the head my son.
'Cause life is short when you're afraid to die.
Life is hard when you're afraid to cry.
But when I feel alone I sing myself a song
Because wherever I lay a groove is my home.

[Chorus]
But can you see me in the desert?
Of course you can!
Can you see me on the mountain?
Of course you can!
Can you see me in the ocean?
Of course you can!
I'm just splishin' and splashin' 
And jumpin' in the sand!
And jumpin' in the sand!

But he remembered memories of walkin'
Through the puddles
Sayin' ""Gee dad, am I the one who's wanted by
The federal Government doesn't want me
To go to school
I ask too many questions
And I don't play by their rules. 
In school they tried to tall me
That a rock is not alive
But I have seen a volcano growin' up and die 
In school they tried to tell me
That a tree it couldn't feel
But I have felt a tree and it was bleeding for real
In school they tried to tell
Me animals couldn't talk
But they can understand it when a dog starts to bark
In school they tried to tell me
Man doesn't have a soul 
""whet happened to his"" I say ""cause mine is 
Still whole!""

[Chorus] 

""Can you see me?"" 
""Can you see me?"" 

The reoccuring dream of life's imprisonment
The reoccuring scream of a world and it's residents
The reoccuring theme of a mind full of finger prints
The reoccuring dream of a knife and a president
Well would you like to look at Madonna's book on sex?
Or would you rather Alex Haley's book on Malcolm X?
Their fuckin' with Ice T but they don't even care if
Eric Clapton's singin' I Shot the Sherriff! 
But how many more books on this subject can I read
And how many more frustrations must I try to ease
End how many more days of this bad air can I breathe
And how many more of my friends must just die and leave

But you can't diffuse the ticking time bomb
You can't refuse the time it has come
You can't erase our people from the nation
I'll take a life before they call us ""the lost generation""

[Chorus] 

Can you see me in Africa? 
Of course you can!
Can you see me in Asia?
Of course you can! 
Can you see me in Australia? 
Of course you can!
Aotearoa? Western Samoa? Eskimoa?
Can you see me in the White House? 
No you can't! 
Can you see me on the radio? 
Hell No!
Can you see me with the police? 
In handcuffs?

I am not a Muslim but I read the final call
Because within its pages there is something for us all
And I am not professional but I love basketball
The squeaking of the sneakers they echo in the hall
But if I don't have enemies I'm not doin' my job
I might throw out a curve ball but I never throw a lob
And people criticize me but I know it's not the end
I try to kick the truth not just to make friends

We got hot wax and it's cookin' on the griddle

Spearhead,"Every million miles ya haffe tek a first step
Every million miles ya haffe tek a first step

I was sick of flippin' channels / and sick of 
flippin' quarters
I called my man Zulu/ said, ""Meet me on the corner""
Maybe we can check out the clubs in the city
'cause waitin' at the crib can make you feel shitty
so he hopped into my ride on the squeaky door side and
we hit the Upper Room/ where they keep the funk alive
The man at the door/ invited us inside
He said there isn't any cover/ if you're keepin' up the vibe

We took it upstairs to big up the area
the people in the house was shakin' up their derrier
Raisin up their hands and raisin up their voices
Tokes was the D.J. I was happy with his choices
maxin' and mixin' the beats they was fixin'
my brain like a smoke that was doubly, triply, dope
the decadence is gone and lifemay never be the same
'cause when the beat hits
you feel no pain!
(chorus)

so a piece of peace for you, a piece of peace for me
a piece of peace for every peaceful person that you see
a piece of peace for you, a piece of peace for me
but I don't act peaceful if you're not that way to me
Every million mile ya haffe tek a first step
Every million mile ya haffe tek a first step

Five-O was outside waitin' with their vans
hopin' that shit would get outta hand
so dat they could test their weapons 
on innocent civilians,
the high tech shit costin' million and millions
money should've spent on something for community
but that's O.K. because we got the unity
so fuck the police! we can keep the peace!
we can make love and conquer that disease
because nothing in the world is impossible tome
I can swim on dry land and run upon the sea
and nothing in the world is impossible to me
you can chop off my legs and I'll land upon my feet
I turn it over to the spirit and I leave her in charge
my favorite record sounds like an African Head Charge
She'll beat up the beats with and eggbeater
pour em in the batter
she'll make 'em sound fatter and fatter
'cause food for the soul is the flavor of the music
spice for the brain is the essence of the lyrics
songs can be delicious and also be nutritious
You can't payfor culture"", it can only be experienced
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
""WELL HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED!""
""WELL""

(chorus)

If the funk is on time
then we call it punctual
we're matchin up the footsteps
spiritual and functional
like carnivale in Rio
the Charlie Hunter trio
Had the groovers groovin'
and all the movers movin'
Cuba, Twist, Reminisce and NME
Graffiti on the street for everyone to see
even the elders in the house was havin' fun
because we livin' life at the top of our lungs
It was truly a life celebration that night
had the world's greatest time
but we'd never sell the movie rights
to Morrie Povich, or anyone like that
and anyone who does is really, really whack!
We fish or cut bait and we're not takin' prisoners
and if you comin' late then you might've missed some a this
funky good time we had here in fronta you
so long, farewell, alveerdersain, adieau to you
(chorus)",Piece O' Peace,1994
Spearhead,"Make me, make me sweat 
til I'm wet, til I'm dry
but then wipe this tear from my eye
haven't felt this warm in a long time
even out in the bright sunshine
in lifetime of springtimes

I fall into your arms
with my heart pumpin' on
like a bubblin' dub track
like a garlicy hot tonque and lip smack

I did some contemplation
before we got down to this consecration
maybe baby something in you kiss said
it was an impetous 
for me to rethink this

If I love you
then I better get tested
make sure we're protected

I  walk through the park
dressed like a question mark
Hark!
I hear my memory bark
in the back of my brain,
makn' me insane...
...like cocaine
(chorus)
But how'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?
Is it gonna be a negative?
How'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?
Is it gonna be a negative?
but how'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?

It dawned on me, it seemed to me
this is unusual scenery
this red light greenery
make me feel kinda dreamery
thinkin' how I used to be

Arrive at the clinic
walk through the front door
take a nervous number
then I think about it more
about all the time
that I neglected
makin sure that
I was protected

They took my blood 
With an anonymous number
two weeks waitin' wonderin'

I shoulda done this a long time ago
a lot of excuses why I couldn't go
I know these things and these things I must know
'cause it's better to know than to not know!

(chorus)

I go home to kick it
in my apartment
I try to give myself
a risk assessment
the wait is what can really annoy ya
everyday is more paranoya

I'm readin' about how it's transmitted
some behavior I must admit it
who I slept with, who they slept with,
who they, who they, who they slept with

I think about life and immortality
what's the first thing I do if I'm H.I.V
have a cry and tell my mother
get on the phone and call my past lovers
I never thought about infectin' anotha
all the times that I said ""Hmmm? Don't bother.""

Was it really all that magic?
The times I didn't use a prophalactic

Would my whole life have to change?
or would my whole life remain the same?
sometimes it makes me want to shout!
all these things too hard to think about
a day to laugh, a day to cry
a day to live and a day to die
'til I find out, I may wonder
but I'm not gonna live my life six feet under

(chorus)",Positive,1994
Spearhead,"I don't eat red meat but I'm not a vegetarian
I like ice cream/ but not much dairy 
'cause it gets in my nose
it makes me gotta blows
snot like a farmer and it gets on my clothes 
it's rather unsightly/ can even be frightening 
but cold medication/ should not be taken nightly
because everything dat I put in/ it comes out again
and if I eat lean/ it helps me stay thin 
check out my hair, I keep it dreaded
about my corn? I like it breaded 
hot from the oven? MMMM! you said it!
straight to the stomach my fuel is unleaded
But not fossil fuels/ I like olive oil 
I like my eggs scrambled/ I never eat 'em boiled
The way to my heart/ is with a garlic clove 
it smells hella sexy/ when it's on the kitchen stove

(chorus)
Red beans and rice, red beans and rice, red beans and rice, 
make everything nice 
red beans and rice, red beans and rice, red beans and rice 
I could eat a plate twice. So nice. So nice. So nice.

Most people on the planet/ eat beans and rice
some can't afford beef or they think cows are nice 
If you talk table manners don't believe all they
told ya I eat with my fingers like an African soldier
I don't know which fork is for meat or for salad
I haven't got a clue when they say ""whet your palate""
eat a lot a prunes it'll keep you loose
skin'll turn orange if you drink carrot juice
I think beef jerky tastes like a boot
when I'm on the street I chew a licorice root
and if I have a soar throat /then I eat ginger
and I will break bread /with those who are strangers
so come into my cave / tonight I will show you
food is for life / and life I will show you. 
If you're havin' problems/ I invite you here 
step into my kitchen /we will cook away your fears

(chorus)

Amazing grace how sweet the sound that 
saved a wretch like me 
Dammit let's eat!
Mi casa es su casa. Mi cocina es su cocina.
you know what I meana! 

(bridge)
get some boilin' water! Yeah!
get a pound aof beans! Yeah! 
get some spice and make it nice! Yeah! 
you know what I mean!

But if a friend has gas /then he's passin' 
it gives me a headache end I gotta take aspirin
it makes me dizzy/ I fix him fizzies 
to calm his stomach/ when it's feelin kinda
busy some like it white/but I like it brown 
I like spicy chicken/ and I can throw it down
chilis come red /and chilis come green 
when it's on the table/ I lick my plate clean
Then I drink a toast to the host and hostess
But first we give thanks/ to God the Mostest
'cause if I am a guest/ I always wash my plate
sip a sip a soda while I sing Amazing Grace
rings on my fingers /left round the tub
bass fulla bubbles/ bumpin like a wash tub
think about my troubles/ goin down the drain
dryin' up the puddles in the back of my brain
But...

Spearhead,"Every woman every man want to move dem feet 
every woman every man love a Spearhead beat! 

Police in the city 
is shuttin all the clubs down
it's lookin like a ghost town
ya know Mary- what we gotta do? 
Hell Yeah! 
we gotta go underground"" 
To da place -from which we all came from 
house parties-they was always fun
remember tryin to rig a sound system 
everybody- would bring a donation
when we needed- to get a turn table
my man Zulu
would borrow one from aunt Mable 
set it up in the corner-
turn the lights down until the mornin' 

(chorus)
But the party ain't started till the speaker's blown 
NO! NO! NO!
Run fa ya life!
The party ain't started 'till the speaker's blown

While he was settin up camp 
someone else would bring a home stereo amp 
with a note from they mama-
""don't turn it up loud or it's a goner"" 
sorry mama- there's no chance
cause if the shit ain't bumpin'
people ain't gonna dance
""know what I'm sayin'"" (""Turn that shit up"")
everybody in the place would bring a few speakers 
string em all togetha like they was sneakers 
and say a prayer- before we turn it on 
hopin that the amp- wouldn't get blown.
I asked Mary watcha think of it
""now we need a D.J. to work this shit"" 
so everybody- would bring a few singles- get 
the beat bumpin
and then start to mingle 

(chorus)
Every woman every man want to move dem feet 
every woman every man love a Spearhead beat!

Every brother and every sister
would pay respect up to the ancestors
we would dance and we would celebrate
even though we live in a police state
then the pigs- would try to make a statement
with a ticket- for noise abatement 
but we kept it pumpin' -till the braekadawn
then we told the cops
they gotta break the door down 
and today -across the nation- don't ya know
it's the same situation
alotta cities lookin like a ghost town 
but the house party will never be shut down
no no no!

(chorus)
Every woman every man want to move dem feet
every woman every man love a Spearhead beat!

Rock rock y'all Spearheads comes alive
on the eve of 2 triple O
11:45
no jive we be survivin'
singin' praises to jah
every time we throw down and every time we puff La
Haaaaa!!! well you can roll my way
on the chocolate supa highway!!!

Late last year
some of ya mighta had fear, that the Spearhead crew
would never be back through your way, no way
we naw go out like that, becaouse we livin' for the riddim
and the funk is always fat so
we bring fat beats like a gift for Xmas
I'll make you testify just like an O.J Simpson witness
our sound is so alarming like killer bees people all be swarming
so like the price is right come on down, make a little wish
but excuse me while I light my spliff and make some noise
if you think the herbs a gift. Hoooo!!

(Chorus)

Check it I'm descending back into this record
the heavy breathing funky rhyme paramedic
shootin' funky venom from my sharp teeth injectors
not vex ya but yes to resurrect ya
'cause I can't stand the pain outside my window
why ya think so many smokin' indo blunts
sippin' gin and juice for confidence
blowin' more la than Jackie Chan be doin' stunts
the Buddah elevates the stress off the chest
but could never elevate boot off the ghetto necks
flex like flash when they try to pull me under
but like the lightnin' I'll be there before the thunder

(Chorus)

Yes I remember the time in Oklahoma
you tried to blame an Arab
but the whitey was the bomber
you be jumpin' to conclusions
I think you spent your whole life
watchin' cable in seclusion
illusions 'bout what's outside your door
one nigga two nigga three nigga four
robbing every house and every liquor store
run for your life we marchin' one million more
Plowing the fields like some natty dread farmers
you can roll your own in September from our harvest
big up yourself... when life comes gets the hardest
Spearheads comin' straight from the cartridge

I'm comin' to gitcha
I'm comin' to gitcha

Babe I'm sick and tired of bein' alone and
I call 911 up the phone and
your like Ebola in my system
I'm sick with you but your the serum
voo doo be tuggin' on my apron see and
I can feel Screamin' Jay Hawkins possessin' me and
damned in reckless abandon,
imagine suspended in the canyon

I don't understand I feel like I'm goin' crazy 'cause I
I want to feel you in my... I don't know what ... I'm gonna do 'cause
I have these dreams about followin' you with my hands...

To the left hand side and
Keep providin', pride and,
Sustenance and guidance
Mass Hysteria fools breaking down the barrier
Militant cliques big up the area
Put your fist in the air now,
Show me that cha care now
And that cha really know how
Don't get thee behind me Satan
I'll keep thee in front so I can kick thee in the ass and
Assassinate all your wicked inventions

Not to mention the department of corrections
Makin' money off of people in detention
Doin' time for possessions
Countin' the days in the dark they buildin' up aggressions
Progressions all the dirty lessons
In the belly of the beast only God hears confessions
Geronimo Pratt's still sittin' in the cellar
Done as many years as they did Mandela
Parole board wanted to know are you remorseful
How could I be because I didn't do the crime yo
Y'alls the Motherfuckers that's guilty
Lockin' me in solitary eight years of filthy
Kill the messenger, you can't kill the message
Yo I'm bringin' food for the masses

So let's eat have a seat
Call the Maitre D'
Commencin' with the riddim
I get open on the beat
Let 'em say what they say about the way that we be
It's the year two triple O
They can't stop we
Aight, Selassie I the book unfolds
I write 'cause half the story has never been told so
No one can stop it the whole world's dropping out the socket
Blowin' up, like NASA when I rock it
The high tech ways of the civilized man
Can't stand my people but ya love the sun tan
Fly the space shuttle like dancer and prancer
You nuke the north pole now you got skin cancer
The answer you see I'm fly like Lufthansa
You can Valujet but you takin' big chances
On crashes. Change your name like Cassius
The classes be making food for the masses
Then shift to a speed that's common for the listeners
MC's and wanna be street politicians
In competition with the envious visions
They chasin' paper dollars to a pop chart prison
But listen this isn't me against you
'cause the whole world's checking out the things that we do
Ya sold your soul to the Saint Ide's brew
That's aight I like the Sprite in you

I'm wrapping her like a blanket with my whole soul
so that she can feel me
like Coca Cola I'm the woo-o-oh oh the sweet thing
my girl lollipop she growing mad crops
she rollin' herbs everyday
at about 4 o' clock
tick tock
strike the hammer while the Iron's hot
ooh girl watcha got cooking in the pot
see Mary Mary quite contrary
how does your garden grow?
Hydrophonic ultra supersonic
or does it grow naturally slow?

Ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
I love tha way ya love me and the way ya misbehavin'
ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
come wake body-ody take my mind away

Everybody get down and do the boogaloo

yoo hooo look watcha gonna do
watcha gonna do when the rent comes due
round up the posse and call up the crew
5 bucks at the door and ya bring ya own booze
call ya neighbor 'cause they can come too
be sure and bring ya records 'cause I only got a few
so baa baa black sheep have you any wool

one for my partner one for my crew
some for my ganja baby she needs 2
'cause just like me they want to be... cool

Hey yo I am the glory-fied of the story
child of a high crime rate category
they explore connect me to an I.Q. test
like a rat in a cage I'm trapped with the rest projects
but now I make my life go flip
like Malcolm comin' out the pen and shit
upliftment from a triffin' scene
to make a blind man murder for the things he seen
to believe is different than the daily bear witness
the spots filled up with the cocaine business
bullets trigger be pulled by the beast
kids paralyzed from his neck to his feet layin' way low
smokin' more and more...
seein' shapes in the chipped paint of my frame window
with slow visions of me livin' in the future
with forty, forty acres, acres and a land cruiser

the brown brotha with the tone unforgettable
it's edible, every word be gourmet-able

Anti- always dope my biotic
Macrobiotic organic Narcotic

Wake up in the morn unlock the store pops
hookers on Leavenworth closin' up shops
cops, lookin' like a blind Cyclops 'cause
they clockin' ten percent
of the CREAM off the top
got mad money comin' down the pipe
from the three piece suit who gotta piece last night
the butcher the backer phony credit card maker

broadcast vast audio radiance, enhance
wave hands, shake pants as I commence

I get reactions just like Johnny Cochran
when he compared Mark Fuhrman to that old German
listen Herman Munster was a gangsta
S.F.P.D. shield on his clothes gave up the answer
to the crack freak just released from the jail
twenty in his pocket waitin' to inhale
takes deep breath from the piss stinkin' air
past the drag queen wearin' other people's hair
she snaps, ""What you think you lookin' at here you look

Get the fuck away before I make you disappear
I don't play that freaky shit do I make myself clear.""

I hear Mama they got her working on tha Payroll

At 21 the brother ""Smooth"" he got a record deal
been working hard been writin' songs about the things he feels
he says it's real, 'cause I got bills, but I got skills
my deck is stacked, if I could only get my shit on wax
when it was ripe he took his tape up to the rec execs
they smoked cigars and rolled their eye's at him behind their specs
your shit is phat but I don't hear it in the format Jack
what's all this black crap check page twenty one of your contract

(Chorus)

A friend of mine Roberta she got a job at the post office
she was college edjamacated but got fired up at the law office
I'm all alone two kids at home, I need a job just any job
so I can get back on my feet like Tina ""T""(urner)
the boss came up to her said, ""why don't you come home with me""
I'd like to see you take off your clothes for me
she said ""No way man!""
he said ""You don't understand""
""You lose your life, you lose your job if you don't do this shift!""

I met a black man who became a police officer
officer, officer, officer, officer, officer, overseer
he tried to tell me it was the only job available
either rob or join the mob 'cause I'm not salable
one night he went out on an undercover sting-ing
bought some smack tried to break the heroin ring-ring
Two cops white cops saw juggling goin' down
they spilled his brain like homey the fuckin' clown
(He's gone!)
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say no
got sick and tired of seein' people bein' treated ill
picked up my nines, walked up from behind
tapped two of them on the neck so I could meet their eyes direct

Spearhead,"Do you remember all those days
the way that you loved me in all those subtle ways
I can remember before you were gone
how when we heard our favorite song
on the radio you'd smile at me and sing along

(Chorus)
but you can't sing our song for no other lover
but you can't sing our song for no other love

You and me would go dancin' after dark
long hot kisses and summer wishes in the park 
New York detail the car 
I never show up  dirty on colored 
people's time I'd pick you up 11:30 late night
we'd roll my hooptie down the boulevard
bumpin' bass and rolling low like we was superstars
killing me softly with the way you whisper in my ear
come here my dear 
they're playing songs from back in yesteryear
the slow Jammer the night programmer
the time to get undressed and where pajama slammer the car antenna...
picks up songs that belongs to us like birds of feather
like heatwave on scratchy forty five always forever

(Chorus)

I was blind to blind to see I took 
for granted the dope shit that you did for me I mistook
all your lovin' for captivity
like Ghetto boys I think my mind was playing tricks on me
I always wanted to let you know like Aretha Franklin 
you sing just like the queen of soul
too many secrets in my heart I couldn't let it show
know I still want you and I'm sad 
we had to let it go...

Spearhead,"When girls dressed in black they all look so lonely
And contraceptives don't get used by the horny
You can't find the key to the door in your building
But are you still willing
The responsibility becomes an afterthought
When one remembers the things that they should've bought
There's no pretending that you forgot
Must everything in life have political ramifications
Even taking kids on vacation or having a simple operation
But my friend Billy told me that sometimes
It takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it takes a child a night to learn
And my son proved his words

[Chorus]
Water pistol man full of ammunition
Squirtin' at fires on a worldwide mission
But did you ever think to stop to squirt
The flowers in your own backyard

For all my faux pa's I never said excuse me
Was the simplest things that always confused me
I never stopped I never looked both ways
Must it always a tug of love between friends and work
Hope to learn the meaning of the word jerk
Before it happens to a rope round my neck
Let's build a bigger telescope
So that we can see things more up close 
Farther away from where we really are
I was up the whole night before
Reading books about places I'll probably never go 
And those aren't good things to know about

(Chorus)
When I feel with my heart, I know in my mind 
I should say with my lips
But don't does that make you feel upset?
I should know that the power of one man seems like a small squirt
When he aims at the flames of the whole earth
But the fire starts at home...

Spearhead,"I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Travelin through this world of woe
Ther's no sickness toll nor sorrow
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm goin' there no more to roam
I'm just a goin' over Jordan
I'm just a goin' over home

Ya see I'm a concrete buffalo soldier
I gotta chip it's like boulder in my shoulder
Look in my eyes and you can see a red marble
Like Nostradamus I'm the promise of tomorrow
Traveling the city with my Mexican cargo
Cotton mouth, I take a dry swallow
To the nearest corner watering hole
The bartender with the deed for my soul
Satisfaction no I can't get no
Lotsa bad habits that I need to control
Recite the psalms but no emancipation
Church for food and liquor stores for salvation
Some day I'll make
It home to see my father
He saw the man who shot the coal mine's daughter
And if I had a dime for every gamble I risked
I could buy a diamond for the woman I miss ya see

I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Ya check with me ya checking in with the danger
I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Roaming the streets seeking Jesus in a manger

I'm goin' there to see my mother
She said she'll meet me when I come
I'm just a goin' over Jordan I'm just a goin' over home
Jordan river roll river Jordan roll river Jordan roll on

Gee ain't it funny - how time slips away I wanna
Rewind the tape to see my life replay
I soak up the sun, just as a reminder
That I was born a sick side winder
Call me a vagrant, no machine to read your fax
I'll never pledge allegiance to your blood sweat and taxes
Don't ever mistake me being docile for contentment
Don't ever mistake my anger for resentment

It's just the calm before the storm that's why I'm quite
Ya always mistaking an upraising for a race riot
You can take my life, but there's no escape
'cause you can't shoot yer way through the pearly gates
So swing low sweet cadillac
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low pink Cadillac
Stepping over Jordan I roam

Ya see
I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Ya check with me ya checking in with danger
I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Roaming the streets seeking Jesus in a manger

I'm goin' there to see my father
I'm goin' there no more to roam
I'm just a goin' over Jordan
I'm just a goin' over home

When the road is callin' yonder
When the road is callin' yonder
When the road is callin'
When the road is callin' yonder
I'll be there

Spearhead,"I say my prayers every morning just like orange juice
I crack the crinkles out my body till I'm feeling loose
I strap my sneakers on my feet like they was combat boots
they fit my feet like Cinderella when I'm shooting hoops
Why oh why do memories keep chasing me 
sometimes it makes me want to grab my shit and flee
sometimes I want to blow my brains to put my life at ease
but I ain't clocking out I gotta see the seven seas
please seven's a very lucky number for me
that was the age when I discovered how good balling could be
up every morning with the birdies doing little drills
go to my left go to my right developing mad skills 
how could a love for this game bring so much sadness
I played with brothas with so much badness
but now they gone I sing a song pop a three
from the top of the key in they memory

(Chorus)
Why oh Why do memories be chasing me
sometimes it makes me want to grab my shit and flee
even in seasons when it's another color sport
I still be memorizing lines out on the basketball court singing
Why oh Why do memories be chasing me
sometimes it makes me want to grab my shit and flee
even in seasons when it's another color sport
I be remembering my partners on the basketball court

Do you remember runnin' the court in September
me and my homies be down for whoever
would come along and try to send us to the showers
from the game that we'd been dominating' there for hours
all day to be more specific east to west
from Atlantic to Pacific fools would come round
to get down and try to take our crown
but we would hold our ground and we would never back down
old timers new timers would get in line there
and take a seat there and try to prepare
but oh no! there was no chance when we was in the zone
we was alone at the top we had hops we got props
and when we needed to we busted chops
wipe the court with your game like we was using mops
what ever happened to the super hoopers in the park
I reminisce while shootin' solitary after dark    

(Chorus)

Brother see came fresh from out of town
and he had handles and like McDonald's he could clown ya
dribbling baby bounces between drinking forty ounces
knock ya on your heels and do circles like he was Curly Neal
but oh no, the liquor got quicker to his head and he said 
""I think I musta placed some stupid bets""
he hit me up for some cash
there was a car crash a splash and then the brother made a mad dash
Rob oh Rob his whole life was like a roller coaster
but on the court he looked like a Dr. J poster
flying high with an Afro blowing in the wind
wiping Windex, index finger rolls off the glass
then swish through the net jump a Corvette with a triple pirouette
but off the court he had a few temptations copulations 
no moderations by 24 he had 3 pregnations
last check crack intoxications
so many other brothers gone from this dimension
and none of those who got hurt receive a pension
give a Bup! Bup! to those locked up in detention
memories too many dimension 
and we say, one more time... one more time

Sometimes, I'm so alive
Sometimes, I feel like I can zoom cross the sky and,
Sometimes, I want to cry

But a lot a them are kinda weak in the knees
Learnin' late about the birds and the bees
Falllin' in love and want to bee set free
Playin' ball at the age of thirteen
Everybody's growin up with a dream
I never noticed what could happen to me
Time flies when you're walkin' the streets
One minute gotcha holdin' an ace
The next minute gotcha fall on yer face
A mean city is a nasty place
Only a rat can win a rat race!
Peace to the people who be fallin' away
To make it home today
And peace to the people who be tryin' to find
Som kinda life

The heart beat rub-a-dub-dub
Show love and love who you know

Peace to the people who be needin' a bed

Everybody want to be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody want to sing a little bit out of tune

It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you feel me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!

The government says that killing's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again ""are we peace lover's then""

Some of them end up in some six foot hole

Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind co beaming like an early sun ray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind

Spearhead,"I was born botanical
The soul of an animal
Deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots
No need for mechanical
I come strictly organical
When I need to feast, I look to the East
That's why I'm never scared of the beast
Even though they try to prey upon me
I'm protected by the one always greater than me
So now I reveal to thee
Because you wanna see
The contour of my mystery
The strength of my arches
The colour of my conscience
And the way that I process my diction
Some fact some diction some mystery
Some future fantasy
I'm the trunk that holds the branches
The leaves who do the dances
My flowers romantic
My love gigantic
From Africa, transplanted translantic
In the heat of the sun
I bring shade for everyone
Like the beat on the one
I'm the skin on the drum

I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum

I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one
Fire one
Fire two

See I've been fully marinated
And now I'm ready for the fire
See I'm beginning to perspire
From deep within to the skin
Yo, the feminine and the masculine
The pieces of the puzzle
See my reflections in the puddle
After the storm the purple of the sky
Brings to mind another time
When we resided
Below the water line
Life was fine there human divine
But in the years following
Evil men came swallowing
Everything in sight
Some learned to run, some stayed to fight
I kneeled at the tomb of the soldier
Said I would love to behold her
The magic in store there
She touched me on the shoulder
She said, ""in time all is revealed, box of light be unsealed
Now listen to me son, be like the skin on the drum""

And as the pepper gas clears
And police and protestors go home
Just as the morning dew are tear drops of the night
My emotions are always there for you
And will never leave you dry

He just like to sit and drink alone

She would work all day and then come home to cook but,

I'm a soldier but afraid sometimes 
To face the things that may 
Block the sun from shinin' rays 
And fill my life with shades of grey 
But still I long to find a way 
So today I pray for grace 

I take a moment to myself 
So I can myself 
To feel myself 
And be real myself 
Life's addictions and afflictions 
'Cause abrasions from their friction 
Sometimes, it's easier to live in fiction 
I can run, but I can't hide 
From the pains that 
Reside deep down inside 
There is no pill 
That can be swallowed 
There is no guru 
That can be followed 
There's no escapin' 
From my own history 
Those that I hurt
And those that hurt me 
I was dead for a million years 
'Fore I was born and 
I'll be dead for a million more 
After I'm gone 
So I live, to give somethin' 
That can live on 
Like the way you hum a song when the music's gone 
Like the warmth on the sand 
When the sun goes down 
And I'm sittin' with myself 
Nobody else is around but

[Chorus:]

Been a long, long time 
Since I been away 
Been a long, long time 
Since I felt this way 
Been a long, long time 
I found the words to say 
How much I'm grateful 
For my life today 
'Cause under every cup 
You might find a nut 
Behind every corner 
You might get jacked up 
At the end of every rainbow
You might find gold 
The last bite of your sandwich
Hope you don't find mold 
'Cause none of us 
Can live the perfect life 
The kind that we see on nick at night 
And sometimes, we all 
Just lose sight 
Of the pain that will guide us 
From dark into the light 
We fall down yes, but we get up
And sometimes we just need 
A little bit of love 
To help make it 
Through another day 
Into the night, into the light
Into a Saturday 
So in the morning when I'm waitin' 
For the sun to raise 
And my head's a little foggy 
Like I'm in a haze 
I remind myself that 
Everything is gonna be okay 
I take a breath, slow down and say...

But nobody wants to listen to how they feel

So it goes on and on and on and on, and on
For a 1000 years, a 1000 years I say
And it goes on and on, and on, and on, and on
Well, language are your tears, are your tears

What I got to say right now is love enough yeah?
Love enough yeah? Love enough?
Can you love some more?
Is the love enough? Yeah

It goes on and on and on and on and on
For a 1000 years I say
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
Well, language are your tears, are your tears

Gentleman

What Mother Nature gives
Mankind refuse to let live
Taking the universe in their own hand

Oh yes now, start targeting the deposities
Charging the negative
Causing the most unusual circumstances

Everyday we rise back
I love to fights like again
Hoping that's our hearts
Where we see sleep our love tonight

Blessed words we speak again
Of the words to do my friend
For us to live in this dark garden
Of Eden

So tell me is your love enough? Yeah
Your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough?

Can you love some more ?
Is your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough?
Oh tell me, tell me, tell me

What language do you laugh in?
What language do you cry in?
What language do you dance in
Make romance in

What language do you make love in?
Oh, pray to above him
What language are your fears?
What language are your tears?

Spearhead,"A child is born, and a mama's torn 
About the life that it's bound to live 
A sun and moon and a modest home 
Is all they asking the Lord to give 
But politics and big events they never seem to notice the little guy 
So make a plan or simply hold a hand but don't ever be a passer by 

Tolerance or violence and the whole world go to war 
Is one enough or is one too many 
Before we say, ""No More"" 
Could you ever love a pot of gold? 
Could you ever love another lonely soul? 
Could you ever find a love that was oceans wide? 
Could you ever find love in another stranger's eyes? 

Oh, give a little, 
Tolerance, tolerance 
We need you more and more 
So lend a hand or simply hold a friend 
That's in need of a life support 
Draw a picture, share a whisper 
Anyway that you can rise above 
And when the end is near who is gonna volunteer 
To be the last one to die for love

No matter where I roam
Whoa-oh I know every single soul is poem
Written on the back of God's hand

Ya see Moms and Pops be copulatin'
Plantin' seeds and pickin' weeds for another season
Another reason for livin' another reason for givin'
Another reason for lovin' and tryin' stay out of prison
'cause everything in life can't be nice and
Everything you want can't be got
But the lessons on patient be causing the pressure to rise
And make some people suicidal
Oh no! another soul, has lost control
We pull him back into the fold
He got strung out on the material
All the superficial initials upon his clothes
They make me wanna go Sprewell
Every time I see my family locked in jail
Uh-huh, the economical can be demonical
Keep love in your soul

[Chorus]

Ya see people are so beautiful in love
That's why I'm reminded of life's precious moments every time
I see lovers walkin' by in the park
Close my eyes and I stop reminisce
To see a little baby suckin' on his mama's
Milk-ey silky smoothness of a lovin' caress holdin' baby to breast
And blessin' the world with another to test, test, test
Oh-yes, oh-yes Bom-bom!
I'd like to sing a little song
Dedicated to the people who would like to sing along
'cause every little song has little beats and notes
Like every little lake has little trees and boats
All people deserve a safe and warm home
'cause every single soul is a poem

Right from the start in a world torn apart
A baby's love leaves finger prints upon the heart
So many think it, but never say it
""why bring a child to this planet full of hatred?""
They might not make it like the youngest departed
Or worst of all they might become a part of it
Involved in it, perpetuating violence, violence
And growing up in silence
Seein' things they don't know how to deal with
And learnin' ways, to try to cope with it
Cope with it, cope with it
And not lose hope

So hot that we sweat, so happy we cry
Wish bygones goodbye, thank god we's alive

Tell me why do they come to die here
And all the kids that used to run here
Tell me why did they load their guns here

We were one heart no need to defend

From the Wall Street banks to the empty homes
Between the lines of the people standing all in a row
There's a crack in the gutter where a flower grows
Reminding me that everything is possible
Yeah reminding me that nothing is impossible
You gotta live for the one that you love you know
You gotta love for the life that you live you know

Goes to the place where it begun

Just waiting for this storm to pass me by
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down

You got a little work or twenty to lend
I opened up my hand he said ""I'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends, you see""

Coming down

Yo yo here we go

I wanna go where the summer never ends
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The suns so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never seizing
And every single soul needs a little releasing
The stereo bumpin' 'til the sun goes down
And I only wanna hear that sound

And that's the sound of sunshine (of sunshine)
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down

And I said you're the one I wanna be with (yo yo)
When the sun goes down (uh huh)

I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I got to pay

You gotta little work or a twenty to lend?""

[ VERSE 1 ]
The main attraction DJ Ak-Shun for your pleasure or your leisure
Try to match the scratch and you will end up in a seizure
Strain upon your brain, you can't contain the plain fact
That if you tried to cut this hard I bet your record would crack
Or either break, what does it take to make your hair-do
I have to put a speaker to your ear for you
To say, ""Hey, I like the way the deejay is playin""
Cause that's what you'll be sayin
You'll say, ""I want a deejay just like that one""
(Inside di action)

(I want action)
(Action)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm Special Ed, my deejay's name is Ak-Shun
Put together we're two, yet we're both number one
Cause Ak-Shun got the scratchin, as well as the catch
And I the funky super psychodelic words that match
And we're the best at what we do, in our professions we're the highest
Is it understood, we're very good, if not, try us
One thing to know if you decide to disprespect
Is if you're weak we reserve the right to reject
We don't waste time with toys or weak crews
want to rhyme, get in the line, I take you out by the twos
And Ak-Shun, try to battle him, you're gonna need luck
He's a destroyer, he'll destroy ya, make ya self-destruct
Explode like a bomb into pieces, so then
Superglue couldn't put you back together again
And oh, by the way, you say you want satisfaction
Well, all you had to say was (I want action)

(I want action)

[ VERSE 3 ]
What a man, it's Ak-Shun that remarkable man
If you heard that he could do it, he can do it, he can
If you heard it, if you word it with your lips, what I mean
Is that he cuts so clean, you would think he was a dream
You had, the man is bad, yet the man is not a nightmare
I don't think that it's right or rather quite fair
To a new deejay, you '86er
You can't be the man who was born on a mixer
If you think you broke a record, Ak-Shun is the fixer
If you need a remedy, Ak-Shun uv is the elixir
Cause if he picks her, then he gets her and he sticks her
On to the record player and then he licks a
Fingertip for more attraction
And then he makes her say (action) (I want action)",Ak-Shun,1989

Come down, come around to the Bush, the Bush
Live in the Bush, Flatbush, that is the place
Where I rest with the blessed, don't jest, it is a waste
To try, you might die, so I abort the mission
Try to fight, you might end up in critical condition
Cause we don't take shorts, not here, not in the Bush
And if you want to get around, you gotta know how to push
The boys make noise and the girls be slappin curls out the head
Try to fight back, black, you get dead
In the Bush
The Bush

We got the brothers with the heads in dreads
On the corners like pigeons
Smokin marijuana but it's their religions

We got the others on the pipe tip
Goin on the flight trip
Soon on the toon, your mother will right-grip
Basin up the world, chasin up the girls
The fire got too high till you're facin up your curls
Now you're burned, learned your lesson
Stop messin with the crack, black, cause now look how you're dressin
Chokin and totin on the pipes and the woolers
While the dealers are your friends with the Benz plus medullahs
And rings, they're kings because of what they push
And they're part of the heart in the Bush, the Bush

I'm Special Ed, and yes, I'm takin it all
The school that I attend is Ersamus Hall
Live in Flatbush, yes, I'm on
No, I'm not a god, but my word is bond
I got the knowledge, wisdom, understandin
Not fussy, but demandin
No, I'm wise, understand
Mess with me, I break your hand
Stop your heart, take your breath
With the diagnose of death
Remove your brain from your skull
Make ya dumb, make ya dull
Sow you up and cut your hair
Put you in a science fair
Tell em that your name is John
Make you a phenomenon
Freak of nature, make em hate ya
Not a girl will ever date ya
So step off, because you're soft, and I'm a soldier
Go get your crew, and you can tell em what I told ya
Tell em how I burned ya, how you got dissed
Then form a line, so I can add em to the list

If you come to the Bush keep a low pro
Cause you might catch a knot or a shot or a blow
To the face in this place, if you base you will be broken
Comin off the train you gotta pay another token
What this means is, you pay for your protection
Pay a fee and never see a reflection
Again, my friend, or rather foe, you know the deal
Either hear or feel
Choose one, but at least you got an option
Be my son or be up for adoption
Why in heaven's name would you diss?
Do you want to kiss a fist?
We can do this, properly, you're on my property
This ain't a game, but you can say it's a monopoly
Cause I control the total supply, and you're the user
Akshun makes the cuts and Howie Tee is the producer
We make it or break it, so take it just like that
Yes yes y'all, we're all from Flat-

She said, ""Of course,"" kissed with force
Suckin on my lips just like she was a horse
I said, ""Excuse me, please don't bruise me
Please don't tease or skeeze or use me

Would you please remove your pinky

It's a polo, she was so low down
I coulda swore her knees was on the ground
I said, ""Damn Ma'am, get on your feet
Be on your way, cause you can't have my meat""
Her eyes started waterin, so I brought her
In the store, to buy some more

You was a manget, and a girl was a metal filing
Would they all come piling?
On your body, growin like hair, yeah?
Well, just think of me as there
Didn't need a girl, had plans for the day
Wanted to step, but she wanted me to stay

Lookin for a girlie, cause I wanted to play
Saw a girl, as I examined her back
Her butt was bigger than a triple dipple Big Mac
As she turned around I had a look at the grill
I said, 'nah - chill'
I turned around, I was about to jet off
When I took a step and bumped into something soft
It was a girl, she was the sweetest thing
Yes indeed, she was a meal, she was fit for a king
I was scopin, but hopin and hopin to rope in
My desire was up, and my resistance was slopin
She said, ""Excuse me, but I was wrong
Maybe I came on a little bit too strong""
I couldn't talk, I couldn't even think
I  said, ""Well, can I make it up, can I buy your a drink?""
She gave a nod to show her acception
To my pleasure, but with one suggestion
Yo, to be alone was the suggestion she had
Which was even better, so we went to her pad
I brought the wine that you call rose
We snuggled up in the couch, yes, we got cosy
She put the glass to her lip, and then she took a sip, and
Tried to get up, but she was slippin and trippin
Did a double summersault, the girlie was flippin
Took a step back, took out the hair clip, and
Unbuttoned her blouse, yes, the girlie was strippin
Put her hands on my pants, the zipper was zippin
Laid me down on the couch, sat down on my hip, and
Straddled up, and then she took a dip, and
The girl was sweeter than a chocolate chip, and
I called her name out loud, I said, Jodie - oh!""
I said, ""You must be down with the rodeo
The way you ride, it might sound silly
But you're ridin up and down like Bronco Billy""
Time went by, the sex had stopped
I looked around, I saw Jodie just dropped
What was the matter, yes, the girl was in shock
She said, ""Special Ed, I think it was your -
But never mind, I be fine, just chill""
I said, ""That's what you get for playin Buffalo Bill""

Gave her some super-strength, and she ate it

I know why, because she had the butt like that of a hill
But you couldn't tell me nothin, cause Jill was number one
Cause to me, oh my God, how she made me come
I shoulda knew the consequences from the get-go
She would use me like a puppy from a pet show
But like a fool in love I fell for her game
But ah - I got mine everytime I came
You know the place, Flatbush Avenue
Where I first met the hoe, I said, ""Yo, haven't you
Been around before, did we get down before?
I forget, but I bet I met you in a store
Mickey D's - yeah, now I remember""
She said, ""That was for school, I needed money in September
Cause I'm a member of the Booster Squad""
And I was thinkin to myself: I knocked her boots so hard
That's just what I did, until we had a kid
Now the bitch got half my money, plus the crib
Plus the car, plus the limo with the bar

Thinkin of a way to spend the day like fishin
Nah - dairy - yeah - cheese
Yo, that's the way to go, but no polly-o, please
Picked up the phonebook, lookin at the pages
Lookin at the star rating right beside the ages
Looked under 'x' for 'sex' and saw Stacy
Yeah, you know the one that we call Dick Tracy
Yes, I think that she can solve my case
So I call her on the phone, she was home alone
She said, ""Come over to my place, I'll cook dinner""
Ring-ring-ring-ring - I think we got a winner
Threw on some dip for the trip across town
Yo, I got to go, cause the hoe is down
So I hopped inside of the rented Corolla
Saw another girlie, she was pushin on a stroller
I said, ""Yo baby,"" then ""Hello, mother""
And then I said, ""Wait a minute, where is the other?""
She said, he said, he wasn't stayin with her
""But maybe we can drop the baby by the sitter
And go for a ride, if I was you, I'd consider""
I dropped the kid off about three blocks away
Went back to the Bush to collect my pay
When I got to the crib ma dukes was home
So I couldn't go inside, cause then I couldn't bone
Bone - T-Bone - yeah, good thinkin
Got to his crib faster than you could blink, and
T-Bone was home alone, I said, ""T
You got to look out now, come on now, this is me
I got cheese, and she's bein naughty""
I heard some footsteps, then came 40

He was busy guzzlin a 40 like water
He said, ""Ed, let's go get another
No, get two for me, you and my brother""
I said, ""Bet, while I jet just wait""

This is a mission, not a small time thing
Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went
Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl Suzanne
And everything was goin just accordin to plan
When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it
Just when things had started goin great
It rang again I said, ""Hold up, wait""
Picked up the phone, yelled, ""Who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors
Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours""
I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped
I picked up the phone, but the man hung up
It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct'
I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck
Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess
Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west
Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel
The rambo knife with the hunting apparel
Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye
She said, ""Special Ed, don't go, you might die""

Took the express on a air force jet
The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat
I was thinkin' of the message again and again
In particular the name of Lu Chin Chen
Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill
You could tell I wasn't jokin' by the look on my grill
Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after
A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master
Knew where to find him, knew where he would be
I turned around and showin' up Mr. Chen found me
I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold
I said, ""I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole
Now you must die, because that is my mission""
He flipped back, got into a fighting position
The tiger style, the shit was wild
He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile
I said, ""You can smile now, but you won't for long
'Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song""
He said, ""Choose your style"", I broke fool, I said, ""What?""
Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut
It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin
Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in
His chest, he said, ""Buddah bless"" and stood proud
Out shot the bullet, Mr. Chen just bowed
So I shot him again, yo, I couldn't believe
Mr. Chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth
Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child
I got fed up, I thought of Flatbush Style
Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky
Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye
He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin'
He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin
Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet
So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet

To settle and cease with the noise

To stop the confusion
Let the fresh get fresh and the stale get staler
And throw em in a pale of
Trash with the other trash and smash down the lid

And you got no flavor
Can't taste the juice cause I got the matz

Honest, I promise, I am not a liar
Can't you understand that I am flier than a flyer

Greetings, welcome to the proceedings
You won't be needing your seating
For this lyrical meeting, there's no eating
And no biting, fighting is in the lobby
I didn't know that so much dough was in a hobby
My last rhyme was a pastime, yet at present
I present the scent - smell
The funk from below hell
>From where I fell
But I still got my soul
So I'm never gonna sell
I'd rather tell it just like it is
Plus it's my mic, so act like it is
You can ask Giz, you can ask anybody
I rock any party, word to Miz
(It ain't he Biz) So what it is?
Straight up, you'll get ate up just like breakfast
If it's a bunch, then that's lunch, and in the next is
Dinner, now who's the lucky winner for the evening?
Flex and you won't be leaving, or even breathing
I had to come back, so there ain't no misbelieving

[ VERSE 2 ]
You thought I was gone, but my word is bond
I was in the deadzone, with the headphones on
Just meditating, then I be waiting for a
Light snorer, then it's off to Bora-Bora
Beyond the dawn, past the corn and wheat fields
The street feels great, how the beat feels?
Get the reels and the deals is done
I be back, hon, I gotta drop it on the one
So give me my hat and my gun, I gotta run
I got a ton of styles, but you can't get none
I wipe you out like a disc, tisk-tisk
Tough stains need whisk', but I can't take the risk
I gotta take em out myself to make sure
I break them legs like eggs when they raw
Billy McGhee McGhaw, they all cried
They all died, they all tried
But they got cut like King Tut, then wrapped
>From a dummy to a mummy, let's see how you adapt
I cut the crap, and act like you know then
Here we go then, I'm explodin

It's about time to drop the rhyme
And take cover, shelter, atomic melter
Shutdown, what now, I got nut now
Two nine-fitties just like titties
Rockin the sound I break down in the cracks on the trackboard
Like Shaq on a backboard
I shatter musical matter
And make it even fatter than it was
Word up, 'cause, I got a buzz
That is what the ism does
So I'm in a trance, I need a chance to escape
They said I'd be alright if I just made another tape
But I don't think it's gonnda do it
I been through it
I get a shock everytime I rock
I'm unstable, and unable to relax
I hear tracks and relapse
Perhaps I got the raps, quick
I'm bout to have another fit...

When I see you in the dark

I wage war on stage or street
I battle defeat 
Relentless
You get shot like tetanus
Feel the wetness
Gush
I'm in a rush
No time to sigh
Now die
Shit is so fly that I gotta get clearance
In case I enter air space interference
Mach 1 
When I rock, son
Cause I take off
While you make fake soft
Little jingles
Sell a few singles
But that ain't shit
Cause a hit ain't a hit without the lyricalist
And at 22 
I'm takin any crew
At any time
Cause many rhyme
But a lemon ain't a lime
And I don't falsify to get by
You must be more than herbally high
To verbally comply
To my vocal range
I get strange when I change
Into the syllable killer
So beware
Cause I'll be there
Lurkin, workin
Till your head hurtin

I break and bruise the backs
Of musical acts
Cause I slam harder than a steel door
I'm real raw, so nigga, what you feel for?
I'm straight to the point, like a line
Me and this mic of mine
Stay tight, whether I write or freestyle
You see style
You never thought existed
I'm unlisted
You can look, but you'll never locate
Where I rotate
Cause I never stop or rest, and I ain't
You get wet like paint
You feel faint, you want to faint
You can't stand me, the man with the stuff
Come with bullshit and get snuffed, cream puff
You are pastry
Cause you be tasty
When I'm eatin em
Beatin em into men's meat
I never been sweet
You don't want to come on my street
In the heat
Son, gashes
Hot flashes
Sun first
I come gun first
Feet second
I keep wreckin
So you can keep on checkin

I'm nice like a old lady
Similak, baby
Pure, nourrishing
Rhymes flourishing
I know you're starvin, come and get a taste
Bring the beef and I'll discard the waste
Shit ain't the same
Things done changed
Now I got your whole life re-arranged
Till I say so
Now you're livin every day slow
Cause everybody nervous
But this is professional mic service
Dummy, now give me the money
Before I put one in your honey
Cause Sonny don't Cher
Hands in the air
I drug it so rugged, those panty hose tear
I give you a run for yours
I won wars
I burn niggas like sauce
Don't ever underestimate the power of the force
Mark Spark the chalk
And turn the lights off dark
Seance, no response
You can't believe you can't breathe
Cause when you're from the ave you never leave

Now as you were
Your rhymes soft like fur
Oh' you wright for her
Well that explanit it
But I reign it, I rule it
So cool it, while I school it
Listen to percision
Rhyming, timing, climbing through your window
(Crooklyn style) be in yo
Damagin' your whole premises
Don't never diss
Cause here's your address
Cause me by yes, so come test me no
Like Patra, I got it soul like Sanatra
Organize rhymes in effect
Snap that neck, like E-Double if there be trouble
So, move on, there's nothing to see here
Clear the area
Your rhymes are dead, hit the berrier
To vary a I'm very a effetive I might add
Original rude, since I was a little lad

I'm pumpin' like Donivan plus
I'm a little vicious
I eat mcees cause they delicious
It's just, that so mistrust but I dust rhymes like a maid
Now I'm back with How
Stompin' like a parade, all up and down Fifth Ave
So you riff have plenty of back, cause I attack, like blood cells
Fighting off diseased mcees
Like Super Freinds, in a metropolis, in a super Bense
With Howie, now we, got two threes
Fuck it, six, gimmie the mix, and I'm a kill em' with the lyrics
So dig a plot, and nigga got, seven
Never doubt, I go all out, scadida
You need a map

You need a slap

So take one, because your tired
I get so phat, I feel wired
But I never sell, or fall, cause I never fell

I break your leg like an egg
And fry it try it, and see what happen when I'm rappin'

So don't get smart like Max
Cause cold hard facts prevail
I don't sell, I don't turn pale
But I'm very ill, I'm fatal
I rock rhymes like a cradle
Many days, many ways, let me count em'
Everybody that I caught, everybody thought
But but, bu bu but, don't stutta
Just say it
Shit is budda
Now don't that feel betta
Get a sweata
Cause it's gettin' colda
Every time I holda
Mic, niggaz freeze up, so eaze up like, off the scrotum
Cause you wrote um', like you know dumb'

Here I go the lyrical specialist with the perscription
I give you the leagal drug addiction, nonfiction
I got the shank, to your memory bank
How sharp, don't be affraid of the dark
Come in to the light, you still can't see
It can't be, the historical, metaphorical, lyrical
Yes the S, you know the rest, fuck the spellin'
I'm tired of tellin' y'all who rule, cause you don't listen, fool
Your dealin' with a nigga feelin' fury
Surely, I purley destroy any toy with any game
That's why I never lose, I never play, I savaday style while I maintain mine
Same time  yet, differ-rent, mag-nificent
No quest unless it's the Tribe
So check that vibe twice
Cause I'm nice
Whoever got beef
Tell me the price
And I'll raise you a mill, days to a kill, some praise to a bill
Never, yea I'm as lyrical as ever

Chorus

Verse Two:

You want to start about, have you thought about
Consequences, sentences, come to your sences, on the fences
Cause I'm strictly throwin' hits
Knowin' it's, unfair
Gun here, throw in a extra clip
Cause I'm next to flip
Next time, bring in a next rhyme, cause I
Float like dead body, sting like a tazer
Sharper than a ... lazer
Open heart ... major
Surgery transplant cause you have none
there's one, shoot a fair one, that's a real one
Grannit, with a enough heart to start
But can you manage when I brandige your bandage
And your stitch is open
And your bitch is open
Is she, somethins' fishy
I don't like dis
When I'm like dis they try to ammulate my likeness
Clones
Microphones break from my intake
For phatter, mass matter, glass shatter
Becareful, I got a airfole
Listen, I got them lyrics that your missin'

You're commin' with your new sound
You never threw dowm
Why try, try my tie and hang em' high, in the closet
Cause it, wasn't, I good idiea
Who should I fear
No one, the son of Jah
Gimmie some la, and I get mystic
Lyricdistic
But wait, your not great, your not good
I shot wood, put you out your misery history in the makin'
Fuckin' with a crazy Jamacian
See, they vanish when I brandish the hair trigga
Yea nigga
I'm goin hay wire
Might fire
Might not
But it's white hot
And with the right flow, the shit might blow
So I detonate, then evacuate, leavin' ash, don't even ask
Feel the blast, fast, I know you won't last
But you can still try
Somebody want lyrics
Then come see the eye

Special Ed,"[ VERSE 1 ]
I got somethin for sucker MC's
Rhymes so dope that niggas want to buy ki's
But I don't sell weight, I sell hits
Druggin your mind with em one at a time
I hit em up with a couple of bars
I'm breakin MC's up like rock guitars
At a Kiss concert, but not this concert
Ain't no make-up, you better wake up
Before the sandman come take your hand
I come into your dreams, or so it seems
While you're deep asleep I'm beginnin another scheme
Gettin that dough, hittin that hoe
In the video, what a bitty, what a pity
But that's the chance you take when you make it
You get strung when the song is sung
But I don't hit notes, I hit quotes I wrote, so
If you know like I know, you better not try no
Dummy move, yo money, move from the mic
Exit stage right, nighty night
Time for bed with a rhyme from Ed
So put on your pijamas and tell your mamas
Beddy-bye, till you're ready to try once more
Cause I'm takin niggas out like a one-night whore
To the store, so who you're really tryin to fool?
We rule, you know we rule

We rule, you know we rule

It gets harder and harder
Cause everybody got to start a
Kid-type hit, but forget that bullshit
I'm on some hype shit, my style is well developed
When I envelop a mic I would like everyone to get the hell up
I set it off, headed off right to the mic
I let if off like an airstrike
I cover the ground with surround sound
Everybody get down before you're left deaf
So what the eff, a duel to the death
Like Macbeth, so kneel to the left
And bow your head, now Ed will rule
I'm takin niggas out like a trip at school
To the park, leadin you into the dark
Now form a double-line, it's trouble time
Now I got to rhyme double-time
Or triple
Cause MC's suck like nipple
I cripple, but they already lame
I come to claim your name and eat your brain
Right out your skull like a monster
And I do what I wantsta when I wantsta
And I ain't even gotta carry the tool
Cause we rule, you know we rule

We rule, you know we rule

[ VERSE 3 ]
I got rhymes a cop can't stop
They don't even chase, so don't even waste
Gas, I'm too fast, I come equipped to rip, money grip
Cause you the paper 
And I'm the Flatbush raper
I rip shit up, your get hit up
I don't take sex, just checks and cash
Stompin niggas out like the Monster Mash
Every single day of the week, plus weekends
You and your weak friends tryin to meet ends
But you can't make em meet, cause you can't make a beat
So now you're beaten, you're meat and you're lookin all meek
You couldn't see me on the highest peak
With a long-range scanner and a antenna
Cause you're fish like a can of
Tune, all on my dock, in my scuna
I see ya later, if not, sooner
So just cool

Beleave in they own shit
Actin' like they owwwn, shit
Butcha never will
So you better chill
Or getcha grill, piece, torn by the beast
You get the claws
Across your jaws

Your trapped in a rap like a def game

then a light came, then an eternal night came

Not fronichole, but lyrically present
I'm in the flesh, yo, ain't it fresh
I got that Special Ed shit
Slap that dead shit
Now play dis
Now say dis (your the greatist)
I got enough to stuff into the ladies
I rub her with a rubber
But I'm lyrically raw
Protect your neck and double check your jaw
Cause I'm gettin' bummy
A'yo I'm still gettin' money
Yo, ain't it funny
How you can't take the ghetto out the Ed-O
Maybe I'm just crazy

Why I think, I want to kill my shrink
I see, pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers,
and red blood all over, a dead leprechan 
with a time bomb tied to it's arm
In Saigon somewhere on a farm
I gotta calm, down
And hit the wright wire
Or fight fire
Maybe it's a premenission, or intuition
Or some kind of vision
But either way, I'm on a lyrical mission.

Chorus 2X

Verse 3:

I think it's because I break the laws of language
Like a sandwich
I eat the whole beat
On whole wheat
Cause it's good for your teeth
Imagine a vaginal nigga like you on the street
Back on the concrete
Feet up
Gettin' beat up
So when we meet up, give your seat up
And rise
The honorable Ed is presiding
Stop biting, stop writing, stop hidin
I hate fish motherfuckers, but I like writting
And snappa, blue fish
I go to one fish two fish
Or some lobster
No I'm not a mobster, but medoddion
If I was white I might say: party on, dude
But I'm the original rude
With the New York talk
So just peep, because the skills go deep
So look, and think about it, before you leap.

Got land in the sand of the West Indies,
Even got a little island of my very own,
I gotta frog, a dog with a solid gold bone,
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent
Got gear out wear, ffor everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A.
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent,
So it really doesn't matter, how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes, daily

Just imagine if you blinked, a million times

I'm kinda spoiled,

I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead, I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed

Special Opps,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Tear him up and leave him when the money's spent
Well, you're just like delilah sittin' in her den
You take the strongest man and break 'em down again

I was 19 yrs. old
Now the time is sorely missed
The first year that I left my mother's house
Out to make my way in this world somehow

I can't believe how the times they have changed
All the dreams that came true still seem so far away
I remember the days sittin' on the front porch with
The sun beatin' down in my neighborhood

I'd sit out all night singin' songs to the moon
Or try and get some sweet honey back to my bedroom

My friends they were few but to me they were true
All we was trying to do was just to make it through
Always thought for the future, but we shouldn't have cared
All the best things in life we shared them right there

So to all those old friend God be with them
I wish, I wish I could see you again
In the same corner bar where it all started from
Dig your plow so deep now the stars have all gone

How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

To comfort an old friend who's feeling down

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool

I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.

Until we all get there

Ancient things and beginnings
Excited about the day when I don't have to hear all the theories
My scalp needs some grease

The same place where the loss was earned
The only way we all can learn
Is if we have these braids with the twist and turns so

I don't mean to be so silly
Such a little girl sometimes
I really want to be your woman

It gets so heavy

Speech,"This is not novelty
This is nothing delicate
This the result of your Google search for something relevant
Stake claim immediately
'Cause hot products cool down 
At which point they'll flock to new sounds
Take fame intravenously
But when leisure turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene you started staging
This is nothing fraudulent
This is that joy shot itchy feeling lingering behind your target audience
You got them all convinced, but we ain't buying it, buddy
Demand for lies is high, and you're supplying it
Truth is brutal; it consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it

[Chorus]
Keep singing songs
That I could write in my sleep
It's like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
Man, you are a lead but trouble not to be
Keep singing songs
Just follow the leader with your blah, blah, blah
Keep singing songs
That I could write in my sleep
It's like I'm counting sheep

And this is not a fashion statement, it's delegate intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me
How can you sleep at night when what you don't write you write half heartedly?
Go join the army
And be the best you can be
Give a new meaning to blowing up over seas, please!
We kick those boys down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula and relabeled it 
And sat patiently and giggled when you drank it
Street voice and street cred run just about the same
Pop bottles and drop names
And you'll dismiss it 'cause it ain't what ya used to 
But who the fuck died and made you king cobra?

[Chorus]

Wow, congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on biters block
Downtown plagiarism's paradise
You're not a movement, you're purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and a role model for parasites
You serve no purpose, you're purely decorative
And bore us to death with your auditory sedatives
No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice, baby
I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix; your boy's a certified sinner

Speech Debelle,"Supa dupa high I’m the lord of flies
The bridge that holds the spec in front of my eyes
These words are mine you can try not pay it no mind
But if you paying forward protect with your life
I’m breaking the barriers not here to wasting time
I’m setting the trends its long for waiting in line
Still got my half cup
I been fed up
But now I feed my truths nourish the young cubs
I stay tuned like Korg progressing to a major chord
Depression was the main course stress was the starter
I used to be so angry and hurt with my father
But when my granny died I cried for him and cried for me
And when I hugged he felt human not like a monster
So when I think of him I’m calmer and much maturer
And when I see my brothers and sister I feel like we’re soldiers
Were on the same team we fight the same wars
Got the same scars gotta climb the same walls
Mirror image of me I know my people love me
I feel a tap on my shoulder sometime I know it’s Frenchie
I know these writers and bloggers wanna hate me
Cause I said that I would win they called me arrogant
But missed the fact that I laid out my destiny
So matter what I do in my future cant take away from me
I’m still learning I’m still trying I got my angel wings I ain't afraid of flying

I ain't afraid of flying
I ain't afraid if falling

I keep having recurring dreams it’s the same theme
Always the same cast it’s just a different scene
I’m in elevator keep up but going too fast
Or in a car with some obstacles I can’t get past
I don’t need a doctor to tell me the reason for it
The answer are always stitched in like the seams on it
And so we dream of so I guess we’re living our dreams
So I guess that means our dreams are our reality
But bloggers keep pushing my buttons for controversy
Acting like I’m not human like I aint got feelings
But where I come from we react we don’t run
So anyone who thinks I take that is so wrong
Know my battles aint with myself they with everyone else
We are soldiers the wars never cease
It’s just now always got fresh kicks in feet
And money in the bank
God knows I deserve it
I put my heart in this and shared it with the public
Never told you no lies never acted like I was perfect
I will not live a hermit
And we afraid of no journalist
We are og’s we aint afraid of no police
Used to put in work pumping Tupac Makaveli
Now I fine dine 5 course and I fill my belly
I sip on Sancerre and look at what I done already
I’m so proud I’ll climb a mountain and shout
And I’ll never throw in the towel I’ll never throw in the towel, yo

How many predictions come to pass this year
Did they know that North Africa would erupt

Spiritual wealth is what fills my cups
I use this hip hop to profess my love
I am not a pop star I’m a mother fucking thug
I’m a fiend for the truth, drugs
Getting lean off of liberty, pub
You see me
They let the wrong one in when they let me in
You understand what I’m saying are you hearing me
I hear what they saying with the undertones
They telling me they went to Iraq to help them grow
They’re so arrogant and so obvious
They truth pours from the ground in Fallujah

Let it be known for the record, your honor
Sometimes you need to blaze up a fire

Demystify the myths they fly

Hold hands with the -ism that truly ain't him
Paint him taint him decimate him
Reduce to a fraction of flesh and skin
We sing riddim for the culture sculpt precisely
Devilish encryption could never subscribe we
Word power and sound moving the molecule
Burn a fool run a fool with many degrees
Peppered decree
Heat the reasons
Heat the heathens

So ready for riots to start happening
Ye and obama I'm not backing him
Sickening they drop bombs then sing hymns in church
Like gods gone and these devils really think they're gonna win
But they're wrong, cos I stand strong on every song and
Pardon moi if you don't know I am
The unknown man with unknown plans
Writing my future with no hands
Unplug your mind from the enemies programmes live life with benignity
Famalam stop the killing spree do you want to make money or history
Cos honestly hand on my heart no man in power's every done a thing for me
Its not a mystery its liberties blaze up a fire to the victory

Don’t know these politicians are preaching too

I woke up lean, swagger of rasta, don’t smoke green, but I rap the track up
puff puff past the pagans we have to
let’s just get it done why wait for the rapture.

I was dreaming I was flying this morning
When I woke up I had soaked up the feeling
So I’m a telling ‘em
You can’t clip these wings, you can’t clip them listen
Any styles that you bring I dismiss them

Don’t let catch a fire these words will make granny clutch her pearls
Heaven is here, I aint waiting for death I’m getting mines here on earth
This revolution seems to be being played out on our T.V. screens
Listen closely you can hear the president running away screaming
People getting free, is a must bound to happen eventually
Oppression makes anger, anger is heat
Burning up inside your belly
Heavy to deal with cant hold it steady let it go
It’s hardly a surprise really they should know
People they want justice, and it shows
Is the only way to go the way it is going

A lick of paint ‘cause the walls felt clinical
The couch became my own hot seat this is my life
But aint no Aspel it’s just us two
I needed more the bedroom was a chore
Hiding from my own thoughts a prisoner of love
‘Cause I knew that you needed me I thought was enough
Over time I just became stuck.
And it weren’t that you weren’t special to me, yes
I can read that expression clearly
You got a look like I’m trying to patronise you
But I’m telling you the truth I’m tired of hiding from you.

I feel like I’m the one to destroy it I should have never allowed us to pursue
Now I feel so stupid
The moment that I had second thoughts
I shouldn’t push it the back of my mind like it’s a chore
I guess that’s reason this elephant is now in the middle of our living room floor feeding of my own fears that leaving you will leave me lonely.
I love how much you love me, I love how much you show me,
I love the way you want to let go when you hold me
I guess I’m in love with my own selfishness
And I’m sittin’ here acting like its selflessness
You deserve more than this.
This is crowding us and is the reason its
Looking like I’m the egotist, yeah insecurity is the same as this

I'm breakin' out!
新しい未来をつかむ旅に出よう!
遠回りしてもいい
あなたに出逢えるなら
I'm breakin' out!

太陽は私だけ残して All Alone…
前へ進むしかないって教えてる
Go Ahead!
曲がりくねった道を
誰もが傷み抱いてさまよい
答えをさがしてる
I'm breakin' out!
体中にあふれる想いがあるなら
後悔を恐れたら
私らしくいられない!
I'm breakin' out!
いつだって未来は私の中にあるって
今やっと気づいた
いつか道は開けるよ
だから Breakin' out!

愛もRealに 響かない街で
Without you
信じ合えた ""永遠""が
今は哀しい Missin'‥‥
本当のしあわせをつかむまでの
自分と向き合う季節だね
もう振り向かない…二度と
I'm breakin' out!
1000年に一度の夜明けの瞬間に
愛すべき誰かと
KISSしていられるように…
I'm breakin' out!
歩き出そう!
まだ見ぬ明日へと向かって
ひとりきりの街でも
いつか愛に出逢えるから
もう一度 Breakin' out!
行き場をさがしてさまようBeat
ひとときのHappy 感じてSmile
心の奥からわき上がる Passion
かり立てられるまま
歩み出せばいい
Breakin' out to the morning!
Breakin' out to the newdays!
Breakin' out!…

この切なさは 何処からくるの
心の岸辺を 濡らしてゆく
まぶしかった日々
緑が 枯れてくように
未来が色褪せて見えても
涙の数だけ きっといつか
花は咲く日が来る
遠く離れても 明日が見えなくても
愛を止めないで
この海の果てはやがて
青い空へ続いてる
ひとりじゃない
この胸に愛は生きてる

心へと 吹きすさぶ風よ
自分に 負けない強さ下さい
雨が降り続いても 闇が深くても
朝は来るように…
時の流れに身をゆだね
地図のない海へ 舟を出そう
信じていれば
いつか たどり着けるね
約束の地へ
永遠に汚れない 思いがあるなら
愛を止めないで
この世に生まれてきた
命のきらめきを
知っているなら
終わりなき旅路へ 歩き出そう
果てしなく続く航海のどこかで
また必ずめぐり逢えるよね

Loved you night and day,

With a gun in my hand

I'm dead

It amounts to the same

Come at me wrong and I'm busting that's on my seed, nigga

My poor chest is filled of bullets and tec's
Ski mask gloves and vets so nigga what's next, nigga
It's real tugging you a bitch to the bone
If you ain't gone do nothing, shorty, leave them pistols alone

Don't want to see you wit no pistols
If you ain't ready to roll, niggard

Don't want to see you wit no pistols
If you ain't ready to roll, niggard

Sit up, sit up.. you look a mess.
You didn't take what it says on the bottle—if you did you would be sane,
so wake up, wake up you've done it again.

You've got to save yourself—it's up to you and no one else.
You've got to save yourself.
I'm watching, I'm waiting,
but nobody's changing the truth.
You've got to save yourself.

You lie, you lie silently;
‘feel bad, so bad constantly.
I don't think you know what you're doing—if you did I wouldn't be here.
So stand up, stand up dry your tears.

You seem to think there's nobody like you;
day after day don't know what you might do.
‘Can't understand what it really feels like;
something so small is killing you inside.

Sans amour 
On se laisse crev

On se trahit

On survit 
Sans amour
On se déshabille
Sans amour 
On se laisse crev
Sans amour 
On se trahit
Sans amour
On survit 
Sans amour

Spécial pour les adultes qui ont grandit sans calins,
Que rien a donné, n'ayant rien reçu étant gamin,
Le texte est sombre mais sincère comme un larbin,
Qui ouvre son cœur et son ? à une catin,
A la vitesse d'un lapin, les sentiments s'expriment,
Sans amour comme un tapin on joue a sex-crime ou basic instinct,
Menotté au pic a glace on se termine tout est permis sauf s'embrasser tellement on s'estime,
Croyant s'aimer dans une histoire de cupidon, 
On ne fait que se vider sur la tombe de cupidon a 8 clos,
Peau contre peau, 
Belle contre beau,
Chaude contre chaud,
Bête contre dos,
Amatrice contre pro,
Capte les réseaux du sexe sadomasochiste,
Vienne au contact en ? dans les boîtes échangistes,
Ce vice ne vise que la performance,
Et le X a drogué le verre de la romance

On se donne, on se perd, on s'oublie,
À faire l'amour sans amour, 
L'argent et le sexe dans le corps et les esprits,je les vois vivre sans amour
Tout semble faux autour de ma vie, la terre tourne sans amour,
Le monde est froid et le cœur s'endurcit à trop airé sans amour

Y a pas de sentiments, que des centimètres 
De nos jours les cœurs sont vides sans émois,
Protèges ton cœur, on va le brisé,
On se voue au sexe et au excès, 
Mais pourquoi? pourquoi? Pourquoi?
On a plus foie? que dieu nous guide
En l'amour, à ces appelles au secours,
Tout le monde reste sourd,Tout le monde reste sourd,
On se perds, on s'oublie

On se donne, on se perd, on s'oublie,
À faire l'amour sans amour, 
L'argent et le sexe dans le corps et les esprits,je les vois vivre sans amour
Tout semble faux autour de ma vie, la terre tourne sans amour,
Le monde est froid et le coeur s'endurcit à trop airé sans amour

On se déshabille
Sans amour 
On se laisse crev

On survit

On survit 
Sans amour

Pour les gens qui vivent des choses durs,
Qui ont le cœur en mauvaise posture,
Pour ceux qui soutiennent, qui nous aide,
Qui nous souhaitent que du bien dans ce monde d'ordures,

Les gens ne respirent que par l'oseille,
C'est qu' il en faut toujours plus que la veille,
La guerre de l'amour est vraiment évité,
La rage de la solitude qui te réveille,
Sans amour comme on chasse un gun,
Entre les traîtres et les gros hagun,
Prete tout et ne pense qu'a leur gueule,
Divisé par l'égoïsme et l'orgueil,
Pour sortir de la hass certains sont pret a te zigouillé poto,
Blessé a terre au lieu de t'aider, ils vont te dépouiller poto,
L'homme est le pire des gros rapaces, mon cœur saigne dans ma carapace, 
J'ai du apprendre a me respecter mais, mais j'suis pas de la chair a tass, 
Toujours un plus accroché que l'autre qu'en n'a rien a foutre,
Le corps passe pour une buffet sous lequel on se foutre,
C'est cruel, le côté bestial l'emporte sur le sensuel,
Le physique est primordiale, 
L’âme sœur est un partenaire sexuel,
Le manque d'amour te donne froid, 
T'es comme un fétus sous les draps,
Rare son les gens sur qui tu peux compter, la bonté te perdra 

On se donne, on se perd, on s'oublie,
À faire l'amour sans amour, 
L'argent et le sexe dans le corps et les esprits,je les vois vivre sans amour
Tout semble faux autour de ma vie, la terre tourne sans amour,
Le monde est froid et le cœur s'endurcit à trop airé sans amour

Y a pas de sentiments, que des centimètres,
Oh non, la terre tourne sans amour,
Protège ton cœur on va le brisé

How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Made me a slave to you

It’s vast expanses mocked my advances
And bid me, oh fragile mind, you will learn how to fracture
Scrawled across the walls

Is it madness to retreat
From the myopic gaze that holds us captive?

Follow me
I’ll take you to the edge of reason
Fall with me 
We’ll make a home in our delusion
I split my mind ten thousand times
But in every world there’s no exit no exit
No madness in a dream 
No walls surround me to keep me safe
The straight line you draw for me:
So perfect, so pure
Untie me from reality
When every word is falling from your mouth
Don’t let it become your escape

Make an escape from the monolith 
Scale the lies of material despondency
I waited on the tracks of reason
But my train of thought it never came, it never came

The straight line you draw for me:
So perfect, so pure
So perfect, so pure

I saw you shout at the shadows
I’d change the world but I’m chained to myself

Spencer Davis,"I know there's a man who can sell time
I can take it away and say that it's mine
He smiles from a distance and lives in a tree
Holding out a welcome hand, a fist for you and me

Money is chocolate, locked in a silver cloud
Everybody knows but no one is around
There's no tomorrow, only today
When it rains, it rains lemonade

So come with me and meet the man 
Whose job it is, is selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings and starts to flying 'round the sky

People are shadows, trapped in a golden well
And only children's lives can break this spell
We live in a land where the clouds go on trees
Birds sound just like a clean summer breeze

I know that this man who does sell time
Is someone whose life lives in my mind
It's all said to think that there is such a man
When you're lonely you can join me in his land

Come with me and meet the man 
Whose job it is, is selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings and starts to flying 'round the sky

Tell me all about it
When I come home
Tell me all about it

I work all day
Earnin' my pay

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

No peace and quiet's in the city 
It's hotter than the water from a boiler in the basement of hell 
In this low rent walk of broken down hotel 

Countin' the cracks on the ceiling 
Flat on my back and I'm feeling 
Lower than the roaches in the tunnels of the one and the nine 
And the clock says that I'm half past losing my mind 

Through the tick-tock-tick 
I can hear the faucet drip 
When the neighbors brawl 
I can hear them through the wall 
But I'm waiting 
I keep waiting 

Cause I want you 
I want you back again 
I can't remember when 
You and I were one 
And I want to 
I want to change your mind 
So I'm gonna bide my time 
Bearin' my misery 
Till you come to me 

High noon, same room, this is when it 
Gets so suffocating. The air sits 
Heavy like the weight of my regret forever letting you go 
And it don't matter whether the windows are open or closed 

There's a beep-beep-beep 
From the traffic in the street 
And a bang-bang-bang 
Like a hammer in my brain 
As I'm fading 
Going crazy 

Cause I want you 
I want you back again

I want to change your mind

I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man

Before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger.
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger.

The can can's such a pretty show
They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars.

You'll have to learn, just like me

Sphinx,"No entiendo a la gente que va mas allá
Juegan a ser dioses y solo obtendrán
Son esos sonidos que siempre estuvieron
Delante muy fieles, detrás te mintieron

No es amistad, no es compasión
Tan solo promete tu buena intención
Son solo gusanos que vienen y van

No te dejes vencer, no dejes ganar
No dejes que el mundo te vuelva a pisar
Demuestra a la gente que no te la dan
No te dejes vencer, no dejes ganar
No dejes que el mundo te vuelva a pisar
Mentiras que llegan a ser de verdad

Vamos a un bareto a ver si tocamos
Y solo mil pegas es lo que escuchamos
Ponen condición, no nos pueden pagar
La sala esta llena después de tocar
Nos chupan la sangre y la de los demás",Mentiras,2006
Sphinx,"No se qué hacer me siento mal
Se agota el tiempo y la vida se va
Sólo un milagro puede impedir el fin

La gente humilde muere de hambre
Mientras los ricos luchan por poder
Están cegados por sus billetes

No, no hay solución
Sólo guerras y destrucción
Saben que es así que no pueden tener
Lo que les da la gana
No quieren vivir saben
Que ellos son el culo del mundo
Saben que es así que no pueden tener
Lo que les da la gana
No quieren vivir Saben que ellos son
Miseria mundana

La enfermedad de la ambición
Hace que el hombre se mate sin temor
La población sufre marginación

Imágenes del mas allá que hacen reír
A los chistosos sin parar

Sphinx,"Voces desde mi interior
Que me gritan sin pausa
Sentimiento de terror
Y no encuentro la causa
De esta enorme confusión
Pesadilla infinita
Sin control, sin razón

Hay algo dentro de mi
Que controla mi suerte
Estoy sumido al poder
Que dirige mi mente y mi ser
Algo del mas allá
Se aparece en mi realidad
Y vuelve ya

No, oírte me hace dejar de vivir
Quiero escapar de tu reino de dolor
Devuélveme la razón de existir
Me despiertas rabia y rencor

Malditos moriréis
Cumpliréis vuestra pena por traición
El fuego quemara
Vuestras almas llenas de ambición

Es cierto que la vida es frágil
Por eso vengo a salvaros del mal
Limpiando vuestras mentes
Llenas de esa obsesión por volver
A un momento de lucidez
Así es mi existencia
Un delirio continuo sin fin

Grito en un mundo de absurdos sin rumbo
Donde nadie entiende la causa del miedo
Provocado por mi lado oscuro",Momentos de Lucidez,2006
Sphinx,"Noche maldita como puedo olvidar
Como puedo encontrar la ilusión
Tu oscuro regazo hizo perderme la razón

Dime porque no quisiste evitar
No quisiste volver a empezar
Ahora ya es tarde y mi lamento
No ahogara tu dolor

No me arrepiento, lo sé
Es mi perdición
Noche sin ti, la luz será un adiós

Noche maldita negros ojos fueron
Destinación y hoy pasión
Condena mi culpa, vuelvo a suplicar perdón

Ya no escucho tu voz cundo solías gritar
Suplicándome un poco de amor
Frío en sus manos esperando compasión

Da la luz, y mis ojos se abrirán
Lagrimas de hiel
Oh noche cruel
Ya comienzo a ver la claridad
Comienzo a ver mi crueldad
Y no hay vuelta atrás
Noche maldita fuiste tu
La que ocultaste así mi luz
Porque, dime porque",Noche Maldita,2006
Sphinx,"En mi vida no hubo gente
En la que yo confiase los recuerdos del ayer
Ese amor perdido un día
Fue el motivo y la razón
Para nunca olvidar lo que es amor

Yo quisiera superar
La nostalgia viva del final
El amor que nos unió
Hoy es la causa de mi desolación

Es tu risa, tu sonrisa
Y las promesas sin cumplir
Y el futuro que soñábamos los dos
Los recuerdos me atormentan
Oh Dios, ayúdame
Que la cura llega con mi muerte",Nostalgia,2006

Tan solo unos minutos te separan
De un adiós sin querer
Y es que nada lo va a detener

Una larga historia
Como pude encontrarme
Envuelto en un asunto sucio
Lleno de engaño y traición
Acabe en esta oscura prisión

No puedo ocultar mi dolor
De saber que seré solo un recuerdo
Esperando clemencia o perdón
Todo se acabo

Sé que llega pronto esa hora de marchar

Alimenta ese odio inerte

Hopped in my Blazer, mashed off and left a boy in his car, then
Tagged him with the skull and bones, cause he be soften
Hollow like a head without no brains inside
And his girl was so damn small, you had to strain your eyes
Got to the corner, hit a left, seen the HPD
That's when I knew that they were after S-p-i-see-e
Turned up my music and dashed, goin' 90, I mashed
Bullet holes all in my window from a 12-gauge blast
He was all on my ass, I had to think real fast
Hooked a left, all of a sudden heard a boom and a crash
Tried to catch the cold, sold the devil his soul
Had his car and his face wrapped around a pole
With my vogues still smokin' hit 580 to Oakland
Still upset with the police because my window was broken
But my beat was still bumpin' and my amp was still pumpin'
And my nine was in my lap if any funk was jumpin'
Got the twentieth and Nice as I kicked my tune
Hooked a left on twent third and seen my homeboy June
Jumped straight out like an arrow, had more gold than the pharaoh
Had my Nikey sweat suit on and it was read like a sparrow
I told him what had happened and he already knew
He said, ""You got a little funky with a fake-ass crew
The bass went boom and your gun went bang
And all you could see was flames""
At that very moment Coke and Ray started laughin'
And slapped each other's hands and said, ""It's all about blastin'""

Kickin' it at the park shootin' craps with some homies
My first roll was a 7, so niggas can't get on me
So since my point is 4, I left a Little Joe
I'm kissin' on the dice and I'm pimpin' 'em like my hoe
So then I roll again, I'm fuckin' with Big Ben
Now I ain't fade jack because I'm knockin with that ten
I picked up the dice, shook em up and rolled once mo'
What came out the do'? Whaddaya know, I hit that four
Fuckin' with the dank I'm hearin' Marvin Gaye's oldies
Fadin another twenty, took a sip of my forty
There go my homie G-Nut with the gin and the juice
My nigga's always fuckin with that 187 proof
I took a big-ass gulp and feelin' quite tipsy
Knowin' I'm like this these niggas try to cheat me
Huh, they can't get with me, I put em in his place
Then G-Nut threw the gin and busted a nigga in his face
I thought it was quite funny, and I began to smirk
The fat-ass niggas face was grounded lyin' in the dirt
So I picked up my mail, and I'm about to go
Cause I'm about that mo' money, mo' money, mo'
Now homie on his face, he rolled over just like that
And said, ""This is a jack, gimme all my fuckin money back""
I act like I was scared, gave his money back fast
And when he tried to leave, I busted a cap up in his ass
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat

A few weeks back I robbed a nigga for a ki
Kickin it on the block, slingin' d to o-p-e
Yo, runnin' from the five-o, you think this shit is funny
By any means necessary I must make my money
If niggas try to fade me, I pull out my nine
And pop-pop-pop-pop a nigga from behind
In this world of madness muthafuckas die
Niggas sling and bang, and bitches always lie
So I choose to be murderous and chop up niggas' bodies
And set like an example, a villain like John Gotti
The muthafuckin' gangsta S-p-i-c-e
They ring my mobile phone, now who the fuck could that be?
Bitch, I said don't call me, I'm busy clockin' G's
I thought it was the fuzz, but some niggas told me 'freeze!'
The barrel was my back, it's a muthafuckin' jack
I knew I shoulda packed, I ain't goin out like that
These niggas caught me slippin', and fuck a yellow sack
Niggas must be trippin' 'cause they Daytons touch my back
I hopped out of my shit and told him go ahead
And when he tried to leave I busted a cap up in his head
With blood all over his face is how the homie fled
I dragged him out the car and filled his corpse full of lead
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat

It's for protection not to kill or break a nigga's bones, 
Back to the story, here's the story B the story on
His guts were scattered he was splattered up against the wall, 
My homey G was on my phone buggin' off my call
I tried to smash but I'm lookin' at some high beams 
Into the eyes of some muthafuckin' dope fiend
He seen me shoot him so I shot him blew his ass off, 
I shot my Uzi up in the air and then I smashed off

If I don't smash full of buckshot he will fill me
Hangin out the car shots scatter windows shatter trouble, 
I'll shoot him up bathed in his blood like Mr Bubble 187 did I do it with an AK, 
Another day a nigga dead up in the alleyway 
Why did I do it, it's my pistol and I packed it,

And in the morning I'll be getting the electric chair
But do I care, Yo I could give a fuck less, 
The CIA, FBI got it in the chest
Tappin' my phone calls, wires hidden in my walls, 
I had the money flowin' smooth like Niagara Falls
The glory got so I'm considered a murderous criminal, 
Because my bullet ate his ass like a cannibal
Before I chopped him with AK I made him say his grace, and then I
Emptied the clip off up in his fuckin' face
His partner callin' for backup as I was breakin' out, 
Nigga refused to die, that's what I heard him shout

Bust 'em

When I was young I had the lust to pull the trigger
And make change out a 5-dollar-ass nigga
And as time went on, I gained much love
But seein' niggas' guts bust at a nightclub
Too young to get my ass in, but they didn't trip
Cause if I didn't get in, they knew I'd start shit
So I was treated like the mothafuckin' pope
Security see me, so they scope
And follow me around like a flock of hoes
I had a squab with a bitch with a big-ass nose
I started to knock the bitch out, but before I could
I'm stopped short by a redneck peckerwood
But he was slow, with the other hand slapped the hoe
Then security rushed us out the backdo'
So when I grabbed the nine, they thought I'd go nuts
I'd roll by and bust caps at the grown-up's
Young nigga got bold and off the liquor
As a young nigga

(He said, ""Young-ass nigga!"")
(You dumb nigga, you),-> Ice Cube

Well, what do you know, it's summer time
And every young nigga my age is on the grind
Workin' for the city
A drugstore on every goddamn corner, and niggas actin' shitty
About who sell where and whose dope is it
So some niggas around the block, they paid us a visit
But we ain't comin' off shit but a drive-by
I guess they want to expand to go city-wide
So we hung muthafuckas by the barbed wire
Whoever was a snitch or bitch or liar
And five-o is gettin' kinda dense
Cause the wire was missin' from a county jail fence
Breakin' off boulders
And the niggas from around the block they said they told us
Not to short-stop, so my nigga got popped
I looked down, and I'm shocked
To see him layin' dead by the bushes
As a young nigga

Shit is gettin' hectic, my mission had to flow smooth
We hit the corner in a '65 old school
Bustin' at niggas twice my age
Muthafuckas catchin heat from my gauge
They tried to shoot back, but it ain't like that
Cause I'm the nigga with the biggest gat
Hoes get fucked and eat the bullet
Cause the trigger that got my nigga, one of them had to pull it
My nigga with the nine said, ""Forget it""
But I seen a nigga point his finger and say, ""He did it""
I loaded up the clip and shot him in the dick
And kept on bustin' till his leg kicked
Now we Audi five thousand, gee
The glasspacks on the sixty five got noisy
We had to smash
Cause five-o was right behind our ass
We had to get away, we dumped the A.K.
And the gauge in the bushes on the way
The cops kept bustin', niggas kept cussin'
About which way to go fussin
We hit the corner, and they bust
At some niggas lookin' just like us
We knew it was about that time
Hopped out my homeboy's shit, and into mine
We got away, because they couldn't figure
Which one of the boys was that young nigga",Young Nigga,1992
Spice 1,"I'm tryin' to keep my aces and my deuces all together
I'm thinkin' of self-murder I know I won't live forever
This chronic got me noid I need to get a job
But instead I want to sell dope hang on a rope and steady mobb
I'm wakin up in the morning thinkin' of death as I break out in a cold sweat
I'm havin dreams of a whole family put to rest
Visions of a dead man body bags
And all the youngsters gettin' their cap peeled over colored rags
I write about murder and death 'cause that's all in the hood
Comin' up strong while in crack yo G its all good
Describin' a way of life that they don't understand G
So Imma keep breakin' it down until dey understand me
You see its real G and jealousy it roam my block
That's why I'm never leavin' the house without my plastic glock
Cause if they want it they'll take it and kill for it
And if its worth sumptin' then blood gettin' spilled for it
My mother thinks I'm goin' crazy 
And when I leave the house she just stares out the window
I think I'm being followed every time I leave my home
Havin' these fatal thoughts of gettin' chrome to my dome

[Chorus]
18, 187 me say the murder the murder he wrote
18, 187 me say the murder the murder he wrote, blow

Did things up in the past that I regret at 22
And when I hit 23 I hope I'm livin' well as you
Its good to be alive in 93 I guess that so
But if I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go
I guess I'm just a soldier with a song out of the streets black
Stressin' of that chronic sack but I feel death is knockin' at my bed
Sleep walkin' with my pistol in the middle of the night
Wakin up inside my hooptie holdin' my glock full of fright
Violent in this art that's only because its comin' from a G to the heart
Got friends that have died and I mourn for their families
Bringin' flowers to dey graves every time I get a chance G
Nothin' like a old school homie from the hood
Which are right or wrong doin' dirt doin' good
And now I know inside I'll never see my boy again
I fie myself always pour brew out fo my friends

[Chorus]

I'm keepin' all my pictures from my homies up in jail
If I told you what dey did it will problably turn your pale
I used to hang with killers and I didn't even know
Wrestlin' with my homies as a youngster age four
Now half of dem is dead and the rest is in the jailhouse
Writin' to me monthly givin they homies somethin' to rap about
Tell me do my music and don't trip off what dey say
Thinkin' to myself I might just be in there one day
Some stayed about the big house and still slangin' yay
And now dey stayin' under diction of feds everyday
Tryin to wash their money they want to go on tour G
Gettin' into the business learn about the industry
Try to help 'em out doin' everythang I can 
I still gotta worry bout the next jealous man
My homies gettin' robbed so they rob somebody else
You can see it never stops let that story tell itself
I'm walkin' with my head down pervin' in the rain
Thinkin' deep askin' myself am I insane
I think about that daily and I'm leavin' on that note 
And that's the definition of the 187 that he wrote

And buck with that 380 until a motherfucker drop

Niggas want to slang 'caine
But like I said before it's a ghetto thang
You wouldn't understand this
Cause at the tender age of 14 the Gat was handed
I put in work to get the cash on
When a nigga stepped up close I got the blast on
And muthafuckas in my hood were down for that
Nigga what I packs, I packs it big phat
mothafuckin' are-15
And fry that ass like sissaneen
Cause in the Bay there are no red or no blue guys
Muthafuckas just drop life shoo flies
So when you come don't claim no blue or red
Cause these niggas will color your ass dead
I gotta keep my Tech-9 in the bushes

I want to live to see 23
But these niggas in the ghetto crave
To see a nigga layin' dead in a fuckin' grave
And I gots to come sick with it
I sold dope and crack and shit but didn't stick with it
Cause the boys in blue they got some new shit
A helicopter that you can't fuck with
And the funky-ass black on white
Ran blue lights with that engine somethin' tight
But 5-0 can't fuck with the 5.0 
Cause I'm a old school nigga at the sat show
I whip shit and get the niggas straight stuck on 
Pigs have a coke and a smile and get the fuck on
Cause I'm the same old nigga 
Even though my pocket's phat my belly's bigger
I'm at the age 22
17 years old shit I probably gaffled you
But forget that shit because it's all good
And Mr. Rogers ain't got shit on my neighborhood
Cause we was all young gangstas livin' on a razor
Fucked with us and we sprayed you
But in '93 it ain't for you and me 
Cause we're straight get the gas chamber

On the real tho' partna
This is what a nigga's tryin' to say
When you shoot the next muthafucka 
You goin' to jail regardless of what mothafuckin' color you got on
You know I'm sayin' 
You gonna get the gas chamber regardless

Starring a nigga in black wearin' a weed hat creepin' low
And co-starring is a psycho motherfucker

I make all my money from slangin' ounces of coke 
I shot up a bitch 'cause she was fiend 
She's spreadin' information tryin' to run off with my ring 
I'm livin' in fear, motherfuckers want to jack when 
A 187 nigga's best friend is a Mack 10

Niggas with Uzi's and hella niggas with pumps 
Ready to spray do a nigga up proper 
Did my boy in good chopped him up with the chopper 
See some more from the north Johnny B from the crew 
seen a nigga get blasted his bloody foot in his shoe 
The bag the body the body the bag 
From forties to funerals from chronic to zag's

My nigga had bomb we called him Big Dave 
Six slugs in the chest put my boy in the grave 
I went to his house to get me a sack 
His brother stood on the porch and told me the facts 
Strange how it happened he went out for a night 
Strange car drove up that's when the pistols went pop 
Should I pull on the trigger and we bell on these niggas? 
Should I roll up the Endo hit throw up drunk offa liquor? 
My memorials of my dead niggas on the wall 
And when I die I know I'm dyin with a bullet y'all 
But the nigga that take me out, he better have the clout 
Because my niggas gonna chop your bloody body route

I caught a bullet up in my chest and I didn't know
But the bulletproof vest was on G
So I kept buckin at his ass like a donkey

But I don't think he'll be alive for too much long
I dropped the Glock with a puzzle look on my face 
'cause now I'm stuck with the dope and fuckin' murder case
They threw me in the car and told me they that wanted a cut
And if I try to get away a motherfucker stuck
Excuse me officer but you can suck a nigga dick

Slobberin' at the mouth, mothafuckin' K-9
Put it in my face told me not to waste time
What's my name? Spice mothafuckin' Ace
Yelled fuck the pig, spit a loogey in his face
He let that goddamn K-9 go
Me and that bitch had it out on the floor
It went on for five minutes or less
Teeth marks on my mothafuckin' neck and chest
He took me down to the county
I'm seein' pictures of my niggas on the wall for the bounty
I walked in with blood on my pants and
Niggas lookin' at me like a black Charles Manson
And I still had dope in my mouth 'cause I'm fresh out da crackhouse

See the same old things:same dope fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner 
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been life this fo' years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5 
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin' each other's lives
And goin' to REST IN PEACE

And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein' dope fiends livin' off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on ""America's Most Wanted""

I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody back stabbin

That I get 20 years for a cake

Pistol's popped 
Another motherfucker flopped
On the ass first up by the 44
Flatline ambulance put him in the door
Loud screams from his homies yellin' Imma smoke 'em
Feelin bad 'cause his partners on blood joke 'em
A touchin scene niggas screamin' in the rain
Looked in his homeboy's face
His homie said his name
Now he'd be lookin' for that nigga with the Gat and
Ready for that Redrum
With the face of a desperate man

I used to hustle street corners back in 1986 
Slangin Yayo by the dub, me and E-Bay in the mix 
Only sixteen, slangin' rocks on a sub, two 'o' clock in the mornin' 
We watchin' under, see the coppers kept their creep on 
But we was ready, didn't slip or slide or sleep on 
The game was dare, you could be here today and gone tomorrow 
Partner, see you gotta try to survive, the system failure, house of people 
Money is the root to evil that we possess inside our arson minds 
That's why so many of my homies dyin' 
Crack floods communities will we flex the green harsh look 
In the face of what we call reality, dead partners and clips 
Pictures and bullet shells on grave sites 
Got me thinkin' about my crazed life 
What would I be, when I think that it's a shame 
Cause my trigger gots no heart homie and ain't no love in this game

I watched the po-po roll on and chase my partner 
See, my homie's get stood on fool, by the coppers 
See the, Herion addicts and fiends walkin' the city streets 
Not even wantin' to care about what their children eat 
But see there's Doggy-Doggs, be a hog 
Young player maintain to keep ya brain, like it ain't fool 
Gotta do what ya gotta do, roll with a crew if you got to 
But keep your game true, cause see them haters out there bad 
Talkin' about they want to jack a young player for all his cash 
Better watch your back in '95 on the real 
Them youngsters out there drugged on that high package steel 
And can't nobody tell them nothin' about their life 
Cause their daddy beat their mama and their mama on the pipe 
When will the sticky situation change, like I told you before homie

My homie mama almost died and had a stroke 
When we told her that her little baby boy was left in smoke 
We all shed in tears cause they did him cold 
I know if he was here, we would all be smokin' like a Roach stall 
Light up the blunt and crack the top off of the Yat 
But all the Chronic in the world can't bring my homie back 
I'm missin all the times that we got drunk and fell out on the floor 
Both at the back of a squad car straight cappin' on the po-po 
And that's a cryin shame, damn, there ain't no love in this game (*echoes*)

Murder is a part of the game and the jealous got me strapped
Crunch nappy sack, sick homies who got my back
Dead bodies, handcuffs, and house rage
Two and the one up on that dope track, sportin' gangsta brains
Me and my homies feelin' bail up in the hooptie
With the fifth degree in martin, the car ain't startin'
Some haters rolled up fo' deeper than the Chevy
Wavin' techs up in the air like machine-gun kelly
I tell all my partners to bail up out the bucket
One raised the clout and the other gettin' ducked quick
Enough, been rough so I begin to bust, straight dome shots
Droppin got them shakin' like they cop lockin'
Ski skirt clout smokin' down the street
With his player partner beatin up at these niggas up in the other seat
I check myself see if I'm shot, but they don't hit me
Shoppers singin like Whitney they wanna fit me
With a full metal jacket, but they don't get me
Not one bullet touch my body, not even nick me
We rushed my homie to the nearest carsa hospital
But it's too late he all felt stiff like a pop sickle (damn!)

But we can't find a soul, fools talkin' bout us gettin' cold
Behold a chevy with gold deeds
Could these be the headers who made my hooptie look like swiss cheese
Fools musta turned the lights off and let's get closer
Don't let em see you pull your mask down, pull out the dullja's
With tales from the creepin' on the hush feelin' leave fo' suckers in a dutch
The midnight drama don't stop so if you get some dirt
They'll dig you in the clear, cause player, you'll be outta here

Puttin' hollow up in your head, runnin' in your home
Leave these motherfuckers sleepin' with their house lights on
Finna kill this snitch ass nigga before my homie go to court
We tied him to the back of a motherfuckin' super sport
Doin' donuts with his ass tied to the back of the car
Bringin' them terror, the burier, coffin carrier
See niggas die when they testify
You better get your punk ass up there and straight lie
They caught your ass up in the hooptie with 3 ki's
Now you out on bail and all you gave 'em was 2 g's
You ain't playin' nobody, go get your vest nigga
Be on the look out for the motherfuckin' snitch killa

[Chorus]

""Like I was sayin' mister ociffer. 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
I can tell you where he keep his dope. 
I can tell you where he stay.
I can tell you where he get his braids done.""

Niggas be talkin' upon that straight killa
He ain't in jail 'cause he snitched on that other nigga
Now his freedom is gone and you can count on it
If you ever in Quentin you gonna be tagged snitch
They gonna have to seperate the men from the women
A lot of snitches in the pen turn straight feminine
And get they ass took
See, only real niggas slide with us
You gonna be snitchin' motherfucker you can't ride with us
Because we sure to do some heavily incriminating shit
Like pullin' licks and pushin' chickens for the fuck of it
Ain't no tellin' in my crew 'cause everybody guilty of somethin'
That's why we wound up, we all dumpin'
And the nigga who don't blast, he get sucked and swallowed
Threw out the hooptie when it's still rollin'
He ain't dead yet but if he tattle on a nigga
He gotta tangle with this motherfuckin' snitch killa

[Chorus]

""OK now mister ociffer, now what it gonna be? 
You know what I'm sayin'?
I gotta get up on outta here, know what I'm sayin'. 
I need a house in the Bahamas,
You know what I'm sayin', you know I got two kids. 
You know I just wanna be protected in this motherfucker. 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Can I get this on
Paper? It's like I was just tryin' to watch my ass.
You know what I'm sayin',
Like I was safe.""

Spice 1,"Four years ago I was stuck on the grind
Slangin' crack 50 sacks straight 20's and dimes
Till I came with shit that got a muthafucka known
Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone
Took a test to be a muthafuckin' G
And all the niggas came amazed at me
Since the age of 16 I been slangin' the crack
The fiends used to scream for my muthafuckin' sacks
I used to cut the lleyo down to the bone
But now I'm killin' niggas on the microphone
Sp-Spice 1 kickin' shit to mass
A hennessy lemon squeeze and bubble bath
You see that's the life that I lead
I put a slug in a nigga try to fuck with me
So step back move back niggas try to jack
But ain't no muthafuckin' love I put you on your back
Start some shit at the party first nigga to glance
I pull out my glock and make him piss in his pants
No shorts on a dove I'm tryna come above
They call me Spice 1 and ain't no muthafuckin' love

[Chorus]
I said ONE to the two, two to two three
Put a slug in your ass for you to say G
The S to the P the I the see-E
You sucka ass niggas can't fuck with me

I rolls a gold Cherokee nothin' like a Seville
And when you look up inside you see a nigga that's real
So if you see me cruisin' by keep your hands to your side
You might catch a slug if I'm on a Hoo-ride
I said I first come I first served basis
Niggas catchin' slugs in a lot of strange places
One of a kind for my people's delight
And to you sucka ass niggas you just ain't right
Because you're snitchin' on your homies be seat up in the pen
And niggas want to stick you if they see your ass again
You're hangin' on the Ave you're chillin' with the crew
But niggas walk away and all the bullets hittin' you

I said one to the two, two to three
My DJ Xtra-large and G-N-you-T

Tinted windows black hearse gold daytons straight lace
Let off rounds you fall down to the ground
You sucka ass nigga another dead clown
You're a 5 dollar boy and I'm a million dollar player
You's a sucka ass nigga I had to spray ya
You say you pack a Nine and a Nine is fine
But I'm blowin' out the back of your head from behind
I'm comin' from the sickest city around
Spittin' some gangsta shit the Dirty Bay is the town
So G-nut and if you're bigger or pack the tight figure
Shoot these haters with the strap that you got from that dead nigga

G-N-U-T in the place to be
Pimp straight up out a player's university
Every since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
Didn't have no mail so I said : 'fuck college!'
I'm brown-skinned comin' straight out the stack
And the game that I spit'll put your bitch on the back
I'm dressed to kill I love to style
I'm the MC you know hoe check my file
The big-lip nigga for your regard
Five hundred dollar spread for the credit card
I hit your town then I go back home
Break a bitch for her mail bought a Cadillac chrome
Deep in the cut for all you bitches delight
And if a nigga playa-hate he gon have to fight
Because when I grind I hits the strip
Every time I sell out I buy a brand-new zip
It don't take a lot to entertain'
And like my nigga Method Man I'ma bring the pain
You can't rock the shop if you high off hop
You gotta let a nigga know you'll never stop
And your game gotta make a lot of sense
You gotta know when to start when the pimpin' begins",Sucka Ass Niggas,1995
Spice 1,"I'm lookin' up out the barrel of a .45
Will a nigga survive 
Or will these muthafuckas see me die
You see I'm livin' in a society 
Where soldiers breed 
And you see murder 187 over hustlers greed
I told my homie to watch his fuckin' back
While he blunted 
I know some niggas that want to kill him
For that five hundred
You see a murder from a street
My survival skills
Hand to hand or combat or even shoot to kill
Can't let these muthafuckas do you in this game man
Leavin' cocaine in blood 
Runnin' down the street drain
They screamin' yea but it ain't because they happy
I think they want to cap me dome
Run in my happy home
And do me with the chrome
But ain't shit poppin' 
Cause you're sure to get your life tooken
I got niggas watchin my back 
When even I ain't look at it

[Chorus]
Survival
Survival
Only the strong can survive
Its called survival

You see its cold on these blood-thirsty streets nigga
You got to figure
Even these little muthafuckas packin' triggas
That'll put you under
I heard the thunder of a .20 gauge
? another nigga dead 
And still don't make the front page
Nobody gives a fuck
You're on your own patna
Better pull some licks but don't jack me
Cause you get with this chopper
Make you spray yourself or AK yourself
If you don't know how much you're worth
You should have took your time and weighed yourself
Its 50 50 in the city when its life or death
You can take it
Or I could have my last breath
Its do or die 
Die or do
Me and you
Which one will survive 
When all the killin' is through
Some niggas leavin' dumb before they realize
The name of the mothafuckin' game is survive nigga

[Chorus]

Muthafuckas say that I'm a paranoid nigga
Because I'm strapped with the infrared and the mack 11
Everyday put a happy big face up in your six tray
? see who survive
Before you get off 2 shots 
Nigga I'm gon' get off 5
Cause I ain't the one to be the corpse
Up in this muthafucka
You know you're fuckin' 
With the original dead body chucker
Punk ass niggas can't get next to this
Dead O.G.'s be hautin my body like the mothafuckin' exorcist
Run up on niggas dumpin they homies
Bodies up out they car
Its just some hardcore shit 
That's uncut and raw
We do the shit 'cause niggas can't understand
That everybody up on the block 
Can't be the mothafuckin' top man
Its scrilla for every nigga so strive
And you will be the nigga to survive

Spice 1,"Yeah well check game you know what I'm sayin'
Muthafucka step outside you know what I'm sayin'
Then get my mothafuckin' Chronic sack, know what I'm sayin'
Turn around, motherfucker sheriff
Motherfucker got his hand in my goddamn back pocket and shit
Handcuffed a nigga
Threw him on the backseat, search a nigga car
Find his goddamn strap, now I'm up in this motherfucker
Straight caught up, Fuck it though, you know

Soon as a nigga steps up in the county
I see killaz goin' to the row
It was a riot kickin off early up in the dorm next door
I'm up in the 9500 where the shankin' is on
If you up in the LA county, nigga you feelin' me strong
It's a million penitentary one OG said
Security Guard fast tapped a shank up under our bed
And bust them headz with a flashlight at 3 in the morning
Waken your ass up with a BLEW, nigga put you blues on
And get the fuck up out the bunk we gonna go for a walk
Police got a code of silence, see none of them talk
About the shit that be goin' on up in the County Jail
5 guards handcuffed a nigga beat him to death in his cell
See 3 days is like a month, 3 months is like a year
Cause you can get your throat slit from ear to ear
I wish somebody would help me out in the situation I'm in
But there ain't no luv up in the County
Cause your foe's got to be your friend 

If the guard want to come and find mine
Two hands and a Razor blade
Then the officer gonna have to get my
Two hands off the razor blade
When I wake up in the morning and see it again
Then someones gonna have to end up D.D.Dead
And if your Friend got soaked then he a D.D.Dead.

Yeah you know what I'm sayin' a dead motherfucker
Barely up in there, they try to slide around all over the place
Like a little bitch or something
They try to get him to calm down, but anyway it goes like this
They tell a nigga strip down to naked and shit
In the shower with thirty motherfuckers
But there's only ten in the shower
Then they tear off somebodies draws and be like
Aw too big too small, that shit ain't cool mayn 


Murder, it's just a part of the game, you get you jugular opened
Up if you say the say the wrong niggas name, I hear the guard screamin'
Shut the fuck up, and as I look to my right side I see
Niggas gettin' cut, shanked, stabbed, wounded, sliced
Watch your adam's apple when the guards hit the lights
But the real niggas luv me, though I'm 1990-sick
Plus I'm not the type of nigga that won't swole up quick
So past me the potatoes nigga, I don't mean to be rude
But if you starve for a minute you gonna fuck with this fool
Up in the county jail, niggas be startin them riots
And if you see some of murder, shut you mouth and be quiet
If you are hard keep your shank nigga, there ain't no tellin'
When the mafia bailin up in the cells where the niggas dwellin
Only the strong survive, I ain't no motherfuckin' cat
I ain't got nine lives, so bring it on motherfucker
I'm tellin' him to bring it on in my cell
Get my yokes on all night long
Bustin' lyrics with my killa partners they so sick
Sittin around all night spittin bout G shit
Said he had three keys the motherfuckers call him fiends
Now he's stuck up in the county with some niggas like these
Ain't no mothafuckin' luv up in the county jail
Picture you life a livin' hell if you slangin yea 

If the guard want to come and find mine
Two hands and a Razor blade
Then the officer gonna have to get my
Two hands off the razor blade
When I wake up in the morning and see it again
Then someones gonna have to end up D.D.Dead
And if your Friend got soaked then he a D.D.Dead.

How a small law enforcement budget can't even put a dent
On an estimated hundred billion dollars of weed in this business


Keep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall
Keep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall
Keep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall 
And if you don't walk straight, then they gonna have to beat you 
Until you have to crawl, this ain't no bullshit
You gonna mind somebody, niggas comin' up in here
Thinkin' that they bought it like they John Gotti
And still get the fuck broke off
Take the hardest muthafucka and turn him into something soft
I keep a shank up in my sandwich, so I can do damage
To motherfuckers who want to test my nuts and handle this
Looked at my cellmate he threw up his set
But Trigger guy so hard died with a tattoo on his chest
So know this gangsta shit is poppin', the guards is comin'
Motherfuckers is runnin', I hear the Po-Po gunnin'
While the bullets is screamin', I hear get the fuck on the floor
Niggas holler man damn it's the murder show

Thought I was over peerkin' searchin' for a home I feel alone
On these cold streets, sleepin' on couches with no sheets

Big bodies paper plated stayin' shaded for federated
My crews full of nothin' but riders high off the Remy

Went from chronic to water but now we pushin' the China white

See we on some old mob shit
Everybody guilty of somethin'
That's why when one dumpin', we all pumpin'
Tryin' to kill us somethin'
Vacate the facilities when we bailin up in yo' shit
Cause the pistol grips
Make bigger holes then them fuckin' hollow tips
You fuckin' with a soldier

You funki'n with niggas that's known for killin' niggas

Straight murder display from LA to the Bay
Westside, My nigga Spice 1 aka Fetty Chico
And I'll be Mack 10 aka Mack Manson
What up Spice

We serving chickens you damn sure can't get at Roscoe's
If you don't want to see no murder then keep your eyes closed
Nigga shake the dice up, roll 'em if it's one or ten
They won't be able to put your ass together again
Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga
Don't be no punk, I put my Uzi where my mouth is 
Yay under couches running out of crack houses
We down and dirty for the birdy thirty-five a sack
Nigga give up the stack it's Fetty Chico and The Mack

I'm in a murderous mindstate
I'm on so much dope and coke I can't even do my line straight
I smoke that ? that shit put me in a trance 
And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
? my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
? chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

[Chorus]

Capping him in his b-brain, with the m-mack t-ten
That's my p-partner we d-d-doing him in
L-l-leave him in the t-trunk 
'til his c-crazy kid kicks one in the ch-chamber off
The s-safety
I g-got 'em g-got 'em four extra c-clips
Infra-red b-beam h-hollow tips
D-dirty l-licks m-midnight
M-Mack W-One O and l-laser sights 
R-rollin' b-blunts smoking to the doobie
In my h-hooptie with my Uzi t-talking to me
Telling me thought another lick we can go pull off
He told me keep your mask on don't take your hood off
So me bail into Burger King and me pistol whip the guard
Everybody up on the floor nobody try to make it hard
Another guard was hiding he jumped out and bust at me
So I let him count the bullets in my C-L-I-P
Me hear them sirens ringing and me take off with the stack
Bailing without the stretch it's Fetty Chico and The Mack

I smokin' on some of that Crush nasty with a G limp
It's the born to die the S-P-I
Playa status since an OG since Lee High
Sportin' a G hat with the short brim

Whatever you want to calla
Straight playa up in this game
Puttin' it down for all ya haters
Killin' 'em softly raisin' 'em off me
Keepin' it real so they can't fade me

Rollin with the Hennesy 
Champagne and Remmy up in my cup
Livin' like a baller but I'm still a G
Soakin' up game in the East Bay street
Stackin' that fetti S-P-I-see-E

The game is deeper than Atlantis
So homie don't go in the water without your harpoon 
You swimmin' at your own risk
'cause in the bay ain't no parana
But you can get your body ate up
When you get to flossin up in that Lexus potna
Look what the tied washed in 
That's what the people say
Spiggity One straight OG up out the dirty bay
Straight out the water
Finna wet you up and leave your body soaked with some of that redrum
So come on, come one and come on dem all 
And watch them bodies fall
S-P-I-see-E comin' with that hard to kill a blow!
Smile in your face all the while they want to take your place
I was strapped with a gun case 
But now I'm back out on the paper chase
Spittin' ?'em game 
And I'm usin' my mouth piece like Ron O'Neil
The G from back in the day 
They always say I spit the real
Keepin' these haters out of my pockets
And always watchin' my spine
The role of a playa is force and still looks out for mine

See I be stackin' ballin'
Since way way back in the day

My play area
Ain't no crips or bloods
But if you cross game then I'm gone carry ya
Up out the gangsta party quicker than you can think
Rolexes upon the wrist and diamonds on the pinky playa
Poppin' the cork on champagne 
Hundred dollars a bottle
We roll in benzes and coups as if we won Lotto

You can tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers, 
'Cause he's got a tech nine in the bushes 

And that's how the shit was handled, 
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J, 
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessey, 
Robs with a mother fucker named O.E.
E had a bitch and her name was Gin, 
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though, 
'Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E&J knew tonight they'd come 
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and rum
The cap jacks hoe and the sight was scary, 
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body, 
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi 
E and J told Jack the hotel, 
So Jack tried to bail Juice out of the jail
But ol' E had the judge on the payroll clout, 
So Jack shot the judge up and rolled Juice out
Now everybody's talking 'bout Gin and Juice, 
Juice shot Gin 'cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me, 
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey 
Mickey was big, he only sold 8 balls, 
Had ninety nine niggas up against the wall 
E and J found out he made the call 
So E&J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill, 
Got the money from the bitch reckless Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive, 
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt forty five 
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word, 
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice, 
It was a hundred and eighty-seven proof,

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird, 
Time for the Hurricane he said word
Thunderbird in an alley waitin', 
Wearin' a beanie, tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird?s top, 
Spilled his drank and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all, 
Mickey and his boy OD were slangin' 8 balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill, 
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill 
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks, 
The murderous cop killer Mr Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops 
And it made Mr Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train, 
Didn't know his wife Champagne would never see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45, 
Gotta peel his cap before the train arrives
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train 
All the boys said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast, 
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him, 
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover, 
And Jack was mad be 'cause Mickey shot his lover 
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced, 
He couldn't hang with the 1-8-7 proof
Juice was splattered and St. Ides had took a fall, 
And then Endo smoked 'em all

Muthafuckas still sufferin' and healin'
Some high tech knowledga white boys blew up the fuckin' fed buildin'
Crazy niggas still bangin' and slangin' crack
To the death, when the game put 'em up on they back
Muthafuckas catchin' names, from shootin' high
And phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block
And I ain't changed much, hell
I'm still smokin' four or five mothafuckin' choppas before it's twelve
Muthafuckas think they know me, but they don't know
I'm sellin' first class tickets to the murda show
Don't want to rap about no nigga, let's get it on
bustin' domes, buck shots through your rib bone
So all you niggas up in the magazines talkin' shit
Get off my dick, I'm 1990-sick

[Chorus]

Muh-uh-mobbin' up out the see you-uh-cut
With a ready to pow one
Nuh-uh-90 sick content of the album
If there's a cure for this, don't cure me
I'm comin' with the fury
Playa hata's gettin' hung up like a jury
So peep the game from an old school G you know so well
The east bay gangsta, leaving caution tape and faces pale
I bails on a full moon like the 12 o clock 
Neighborhood watch scared to look and see who on the block
Just fed a rally's, no po-po come around here
'cause it's a different time, different game, different year
1990 sick

Pullin up a 500 with the 20-inch D's
A muthafucka better freeze
When he see me cockin these
Two glocks, bust off a few shots
Catch a muthafuckin case like 2Pac
A real nigga gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Livin in the city with the killers and thugs
And might be dealin some drugs
A nigga either show love
Or bust slugs in mugs
Time tickin on my Rolex
Niggas be watchin me dippin and trippin if I'm heated
Cause I leave they ass deleted, erased
I seen the bitch in his face
When I was pullin on the trigger
One less nigga
Enemies stallin, I be killin em all
Cause I got the brains and balls
And I don't beckon for no bitches or no niggas at all
It's r.i.p. on the wall
I be the last nigga standin tall

[ CHORUS ]
Real niggas gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Suckers dream of schemes
A baller fiend for cream
I weigh my muthafuckin life on a triple beam

[ VERSE 2 ]
Don't let your mouth write a check that your balls can't cash
Or put your Uzi where you mouth is, nigga, we on a mash
Ain't no rules to the game, muthafuckas run up and blast
Drive the car in a alley, throw the body up in the trash
If it wasn't for rappin I'd be jackin you muthafuckas
With the fully automatic, we killers, you can't touch us
Tell me how you gon' deal with the niggas that feed
When they're comin from the city where the murderers bleed
Keep a strap on the side, a A.K., Mac-10
Watchin all my enemies and all my friends
Rollin up on niggas with the Tec in a Benz
Might need checkin my ends, money and power'll win
And when the enemies see me, I'ma dip in the cut
Pull out my Uzi and tear his muthafuckin ass up
Mob shit, dumpin and jump in a drive-by bucket
Screamin out 'fuck it'!

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
When I'm dead throw a blunt in my casket if I didn't die high
My niggas go to war for me in gee rides
Skip the killas, real niggas pack Uzis up in the pillows
Big figures, hope you feel us, we love them big wheels
Puttin niggas in comas if he ain't dead from the blast
Get to hospital, stick a knife in his ass
Mob into the hooptie, put the foot to the gas
Forget wearin a mask and stick and move real fast
Got the morgue on my pager
Niggas be talkin 'bout killin me while I'm sleepin in my bed alone
And when I'm headin home they want to follow me on
Until I tap em with the strap and get to bustin the chrome
It's bullet holes in my hooptie
Some muthafuckas rollin round want to shoot me
It's all bad, live a life on the razor with all eyes on me
These niggas be talkin, but they be so phoney

You was fuckin' with a killa your potnahs tried to tell you 
But you didn't listen now your whole chest missin' in action 
Cause I'm kidnappin motherfucker's souls 
Leavin' holes in they bodies when they go 
I pops out the motherfuckin' Chevy three fifty ragtop 
Still bustin' down the fuckin' block, the killin' don't stop 
We regulate the co-kayana in a hoggish manna 
It's like you fuckin' with the man-a, Tony Montana

And your memory and corpse with shit up in it

But niggas still kicked him in his motherfuckin' head 
But a cop with a donuts busted my choppa in the air 
Niggas can't fuck with these motherfuckin' nightmares

Spice 1,"Hey yo, Spice
What's goin' on, man?
I see five-o over there
Is that five-o?

Same muthafuckas that beat my partner down last week
But I ain't trippin', I got this 187 Proof by my side
It's finna be on

Is that right?

Yeah

But where you stayin at, man, what's goin' on?

Same mothafuckin' neighborhood, man
Just tryin' to get this shit off the ground
This rap thing, you know?

Yeah, I heard that shit, man
Let them niggas know what time it is

Yeah
Check it

I like to walk around my hood, smokin' dank a lot
I see some brothers in the trees, is they slingin' rocks?
Runnin' through a broken-down wooden fence
A nigga didn't have brains 'cause he smoked since
Or sess, or whatever you want to call it
He got the task on his ass, better haul it
Fiends suckin' up the crack in the backyard
Dropped a pebble on the ground, now he's lookin' hard
Will he keep searchin' or will he cease and just forget the hit?
Or pull a jack move and let the nine click
I'm in the cut, late night, about 12 o'clock
I see some brothers bustin' caps in a parking lot
There go my homies rollin' up in a black 'Vette
Nothin' but the money for the paycheck
""Another day, another dead up in the alleyway""
That's what the boys in the Bay up in Cali say
The California life, task in the palm trees

Funk, is a part of my life
It's the sound of the gangster Spice
Warning, check out the blast of a shotgun
Nine mothafuckin' millimeter, have one
Or two or three or four
Cause every brother in my hood is hardcore
Boom-boom! to the death of a cop
Pop-pop-pop!, see another one drop
Crazy-ass nigga off the peppermint schnapps
And now you wonder why young niggas sling hop?
Never woulda thought I'd be a dealer of dope
Niggas slingin' and bangin' and breakin' necks and throats
The spot, it was poppin', but yet the fuzz kept ridin' my jock
Tick-tock, I watch the clock, they flock
See a undercover cop raise off the block
That's how it is in the game of slingin' rocks
Cause on the TV they make it look real good
But Mr. Rogers ain't got shit on my niggas up in the neighborhood

Welcome to the ghetto, although I call it my neighborhood
Some people get out, but some people stay for good
I see a dope fiend yellin' he's a O.G.
He scratched his head and started starin' like he knows me
I say, ""What up, old man, I seen your face before""
It was my homie's pops, shirt dirty, pants tore
He had a 40 in his hand, left a little swallow
He said, ""Young-ass nigga,"" and then he threw the bottle
I ducked down, and I had to duck real fast
Stepped two feet back, and then I banked his ass
I started kickin' and stompin' my nigga's brains out
I heard a bitch yell ""freeze!"" and runnin' out the house
It was his wife, and the bitch started bustin' at me
I can't believe this shit, this bitch is trigger-happy
Pull out my nine, bust the bitch in the left titty
That's how it is in a burned-out dopefiend city
And now you're sayin' I'm the nigga up to no good
If gives a fuck if you're Bush, you get jacked up in my neighborhood

Comin down now
Spice 1
Ya know
Jah man
Come again

Everybody want to go to heaven
But don't nobody want to die
Life's too sweet to pass by
Lookin at the hourglass, I
See how fast time fly
I keep a strong will to live
I be a old man with a lotta game to give
I'll make the kids do somethin more positive
Instead of bein like me, a thug or gee
Tryin to stay up out the penitentiary
I got a whole army, some r.i.p.
Some stuck in a cell, some out on bail
Some doin major fed time in jail
I'm lookin at the world with hungry eyes
Inner city full of jealousy and lies
Hopin that the Lord'll hear my cries
Help a young black male rise
Enemies pose as friends
Player never know when his life'll end
Can't trust too many, can't cross the game
Walk with my head down in the rain
Think about greed, some disease
Cause everybody rappin still gettin cheese
Some think about the pain that they inflict
And some don't think, just stack the chips

[ CHORUS ]
Everyone wan to go to heaven
But nobody wan to die
Mi say
Everyone want a million dollar
But nobody want to work

Everybody want a million
More jails, less schools for the children
Invest in a penitentiary
Makin money off niggas like you and me
My God, it's the turn of the century
I wonder what the game got in store for me
Will it be a lotta seeds, my gees be free
Or be six feet deep on the day of release?
I can't stand it, lost in the game again
Will I win? Nobody knows in the end
I keep strugglin, pullin on the game of life
Try to stay on my toes, up on the edge of knife
I'm wakin up from the nightmares, who cares?
God, I heard death comin up the stairs
I got the past still hauntin me
Still knowin how my enemies want me
You never know when it's time to go
The blind lead the blind
If you don't know the game, get left behind
No love, hold up, what you thinkin of?
Youngsters on the corner goin dub for dub
You can't tell em, cause ain't nobody payin em mo'
Lost in the thug life, gone for sho'
Too many young players six feet in the flo'
As another one goes as modern-day hero

[ CHORUS ]

To other rappers that rose out the concrete, stay strong
Have faith in God, it won't be too long, hold on
Never lose faith in dreams
Watch the next people, they canive and scheme
A cold world, ghetto kids born to die
Some fall in the game without a chance to fly
In too deep, can't escape the drama
Too much drama for a young player, young timer
Pushed in the game at the age of 12
Hangin on the block, all about the mail
It's hard livin, somebody gotta lace the young
Before they get enough rope to leave theyself hung
Hardcore livin in the projects (projects)
Hustlers schemin for the profit (profit)
Mo' cash comes in and go fast
Toe-tags, dead homies in bodybags
Where it stops, nobody knows
I'm paranoid, is these enemies or foes?
Can't call it, sleep with a open eye
This world'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry
Stay real, keep a strong mind and strive
Cause what it boils down to is stayin alive
Nigga strugglin, keep your eye on the game
And never stay the same, things always change

I had to pistol whip the nigga because he knows who we are

Didn't need no scrilla to get her, she want a thug nigga

Shadetree niggas be tryin' to get in my mix
Conflicts, forty caliber cliques when I be burying tricks
She seen me knock niggas out now I do walk bys
Now I put faulty ass niggas between them chalk lines
See everybody be lookin' when I be bailin', trailin' indo smoke
See it ain't nothing but the smooth sailin'
And now I kick back and enjoy my riches on a sunny day

See the same old things:same dope fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner 
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been life this fo' years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5 
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin' each other's lives
And goin' to REST IN PEACE

My cousin died last year 
And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein' dope fiends livin' off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on ""America's Most Wanted""

And though my old school homies do the same thang
I still got love 'cause you gotta live
So you can give

I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody back stabbin
But I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin'
Death gives a shit about your color
But yet I see mo dead young brothas

Seein' 24 brothas die by the end of the year

I probably still do it
Put a Nine in my draws get straight to it 
I hope that I never see the day  
That I get 20 years for a cake

Spice 1,"Damn!
Standing here brings back a gang of memories, man
Sitting on this old block
All the violence and drugs you know
But I lived through it
Get this shit on, yeah nigga, you and them
Motherfuckers
Rest in player pieces my niggas
Blaaow!

Innocent bystanders be laying up in the streets
In the concrete jungle where real niggas be packing heat
Leaving your insides exposed to the witnesses walking by
Here today and gone tomorrow my nigga, we born to die
Keep your eyes open partner, ain't no rules in this shit
My nigga died with three kids and a wife, ain't that a bitch
I can't go clubbing because I'm thugging with some G's for real
I see some niggas at the party, then I'm subject to kill
Keep my head over the water, uzi in the stash
Niggas try to wet me up that's why I dumped on they ass
I had a homey named ?Money' now he's R.I.P
Niggas set him and killed him for some key's and g's
I don't know why they fuck did it, niggas plotting and scheme
That's why you can never be blind to a broke man's dream
Because see I'm losing it. I can't take it. I miss my peers 
Talk to my nigga, Makaveli. He's been dead for two years
Episodes of divine intervention, invade my mind
Got me thinking, damn I could've been dead, a couple times
Killer pits and extra clips, around my bed when I sleep
Stash my glock under my pillow, twenty gauge by my feet
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
For my homies dead and gone in the wind
Gone with the wind, gone with the wind
Gone with the wind, gone with the wind

[Chorus: x2]
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
Put the fire to the blunt, take a sip of the Hen
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
On my homies dead, gone with the wind
Gone with the wind

Too many niggas smile in my face and back stab
I'm left throwing niggas in the trunk and kidnap
Thugging and loving bitches obsessed with this mob shit
Niggas thinking they moving 
And bailing out the cut with the quickness
Suckers be blind to this real shit, we bring the pain
Bossalini, Fetty Chico, Shiznilti still in the game
Immortalized forever, having my homies up in the grave
Thinking back on when I used to drank yac in my younger days
Bust the twelve gauge shotty, too young to buy liquor
Little bad ass niggas grew up to be mob figures
Living life on a razor; cars, money and bitches
Niggas plotting to kill us, coming in coupes in a milli's
We go to war ?til they feel us, bury they ass on the realest
(not sure what is said) eliminate you for scrilla
Niggas dying on the frontline
Spending most of they life ducking the one time, no sunshine
In the world of sin, from the gutter to the pen
Got me swimming in the game with a brim on my shark's fin
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
For my homies dead and gone in the wind
Gone with the wind

[Chorus]

I ain't no bitch but if you bone me I'm coming 
Running double trying to murder something
Eyes red and heart pumping
Serving niggas out the back of the Caddy 
Hitting corners, 
Ain't no love for you snitch ass niggas in California
Ducking suckers and shady bitches, scheming to gaffle riches
Niggas living fictitious, running game and selling fishes
Paranoia of surveillance vans watching me close
Nigga ? dreams died back in '94
Suckers laid down my homey, I just had to get off
Can't be acting like no bitch nigga, because war is raw
They say nice guys finish last and the good die young
Too many real niggas put to death by the hand of the gun
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
On my homies dead and gone in the wind
Gone with the wind, Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind, gone with the wind
Gone with the wind

We're comin' in group with mob tactics and game
Ghetto soldiers when we step on the scene
Flossin' diamonds flashin' red beams
My squad like the S.W.A.T. team
Security areas scopin' I'm with the Fourteen
By any means cream rules everything
Money is power rather die like a soldier than
Live my life as a coward
How many players spit the real hits?
How many ballers you know that you makin' scrill with?
Haters be actin' like the game is gone
But they ain't open they eyes
I've been spendin' dead presidents since they was alive
It's like Newport to G.P.C.
Generic haters get smoked quick up because they cheep
We yay deep like a shark I pull you under the water
Get you caught up in some thug (Shhhh)
Steady mobbin' and stackin' chips in the dirty Bay
Suit angles and hittin' switches thugs ain't your average
Marks just give up all they cabbage
See the big fish eat up the guppies
It's like real big dogs to little pound puppies
.22 to a .50 cal.(iber) got 'em curious
But my style was a problem child
Robbin' banks when I was juvenile
I told my P.O. (parole officer) I wouldn't give him no drama
But if they try to take my life I'm dumpin', that's on my momma 
And my little girl the world is pre-timers

Pants saggin', twisted up with the braids
Leave the house three in the mornin 'fore the drug unit raid
Get out the cemetery, visit my soldiers up in the grave
Tell 'em I miss the times when we used to get paid
Though I'm thugging without ya

Now the taste of Crystal is fillin' up my bladder
What's the time on the rolie? It don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was tryin' to sort
To make a long story short,
Ran into this girl named Sally
Knew her from the backseat of my homeboy's Navi
She said what's up, yeah, what's the deal?
Check the nappy weave, of course it ain't real
Then I looked down, she was fat in the front
I asked how long, she said, ""About 6 months""
""Oh, how time flies when you're havin fun""
She said, ""Yeah, but the damage is done""
""Where you been?"" ""On a little vacation""
""Oh, by the way, congratulations
Who's the lucky man?"" She said, ""I got him on file""
Then she said, ""It's Spice 1"", and smiled
I dropped my stout, then everything went blank
""Had a baby by you, the neighborhood skank?""
She said, ""Yeah, don't you remember that day?""
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said, ""Damn, are you sure it's mine?
My homies did the Soultrain on ya plenty of times""
She said, ""That day, nah, I was whorin'
And your ass is mine"", that's when the sweat started pourin
Cause all I seen was Spice 1 up in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about givin up the fetti
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the belly
Nah, 'cause then I'd really be faded
That's murder one, 'cause it was premeditated
What should I do? Kidnap the bitch and flee?
How many months left? Damn, only 3
I'm gettin' faded

Goddamn, what the fuck I done got myself into?
This shit is dense

Damn, I'm gettin' faded

Muthafuckas tryin to take my driver's license and shit

Bitch, you can't fade me

This bitch got a grip on my mothafuckin' nuts, mayn

Damn, I'm gettin' faded

But you know?
I ain't finna go out

It's crazy, because before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge to try to creep with her
See, the booty in the front was all in place
But the girl had a pitbull face
So I ran, jumped, drove, swam, crawled, hid
Oh Lord, God forbid
The homies see me at the hotel
Cause I know they would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows you're nasty
Elbows and knees and feet was hella ashy
So hold the big fat butt steady
Cause yo, bitch, I got the three rubbers ready
She started gruntin and squeelin' like a wild bore
I hit the ass from Cali to Singapore
I dropped her off, man, and now I'm knowin'
That I'ma hate myself in the mornin'
I got drunk to help me forget
Damn, another day, another hit
Shit, I'm gettin' faded

No cigars, nigga

Damn, you can't fade me

You better fire up a mothafuckin' blunt and get some Hen-dog

9 months later she's ready to drop the load
And all the partners in the hood already know
That it's 'posed to be mine, and they laughin' at me
You know Spice 1 can't be havin' that, gee
thinkin' to myself: why did I bang her?
Now I'm in the closet lookin' for the hanger
Kaos, Vic Rock and ? won't let up
They won't shut up, I'm gettin' fed up
Cause I know, you're tryin to break me
And if I find out you're tryin to fade me
I'ma clock yo ass with my shoe
Beat you down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is gettin' kinda major
The baby came out, damn, it was a life saver
lookin' like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine, that was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smilin, yeah, 'cause it read 'negative'
Damn, why did I let her live?
After that I shoula got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no, I just told the hoe who laid me
""Excuse me, bitch, it's a switch, you can't fade me""

Nah, bitch, it ain't even finna go down like that
A nigga like me ain't finna go for the okey-doke
The bitch out here thinkin' she get a muthafucka for his cash and shit
Playin' a muthafucka for some type of bitch-ass nigga
But you know what?
Before I go for the okey-doke, hoe
I'ma let the pistol smoke

Vibrate love an happiness in this ghetto maze
Hate us playaz got this ryhme stayin' in a rage
Kill wit a pill, broke game like Nintendo
Three hours an fourty-four minutes straight to Frisco
Bumpin the Rappin, 4-Tayzee baby
Me an 40 Water in the big body Mercedez

Four hundred, five hundred V-12 black coupe
None of my weebles wake that barkley comin' out the roof
Choppin' major game on the strength
Man we goes back juss like them splinters an 'em temps, uh
Met this bitch that was in Houston, said she was from Houston
Said her profession was stackin' major paper roll
First at times it seems, gold credit cards we get that ass
Went from bennies to bossalini's, collectin cash
They whistlin', I'm glistin' like Sammy Davis
Born an raised in the Bay them hataz can't fade us
I am the rapper that they call 4-Tay
360 degrees, they can't fade the Yay, fool

Fuckin' off in the Bay wit some crazy niggas
Gettin' drunk, gettin high so they saved ya nigga
From the bottom of the stream to the top of the mountian
In the ""O"" straight clownin'
Talkin bout whats goin down an
These niggas feelin' me
Soakin' up the love I give
Nigga all of us got kids, an only got one life to live
But sometimes that shit don't matta
Animosity can lead we to ratta-tatta
Splatta
All over shit, an leave tricks motionless
Drinkin' blood like I, an spittin' fire like kiss
The only nigga sick as this
Behind me
Is the gangsta, S-P-I-C-E

Yeah smell me
Yo five albums in the game
500 Benzo in my name
Five niggas in a bucket
Five zig-zags to the brain
To the greedy lil paper, I'm on the MTV news
I'm havin slugs fo shistey niggas, tryin' ta give me the blues
I ain't a mutha fuckin' Italian
But my crew run like the Mafia
Eightball, 4-Tay, Banks, an 40 Water
An me Bossalini, Freddy Chico, Chanelle shit
Met a couple of inncidents where some niggas tried to kill me
Juss a part of the game
Jelous niggas out fo fame
When steady bustin' at me
Is to give no names
But when they runnin' up on this muthafuckin' Don
They catchin' pieces of hell
Hot slugs from a nigga that's fresh out on bail

Long time comin' baby
Somewhere off in the hills
Me an 40 Waters choppin' it up, keep or kill
On the real about this underground lifestyle
Intoxicated
An always heavily sedated
Bank's rocks the beat
I grab the mic an bust
Turn into a monster
Eatin' weak mc's up
Smokin' trees up
Pinnin' hoes knees up
Feds wouldn't ease up
Had to put the keys up
Findin' Jesus prayin' fo the weak
Hopin' somebody's on they knees prayin' for me
In the midnight hour somewhere on them drugs
In a room full 'o thugs, 40 tell em how it was

They shot my mama's house up, back in 1992 ('92)
I keep goin' back an play possum like I don't know who
If I knew who, what, when, where an how
If I knew back then, would I know now?
The rap game ain't never gonna be decreasin'
The only thing the rap game
Gonna keep on doin' is increasin' (increasin)
There will be no over-night sensations
Them 40, Eightball, MJG, only drip
We been layin' it down since trout season
Now all of a sudden I look good as Toni Braxton
In a white house wit toys of traction
Uppercussion, ya may wanna take a second look
You can find me in the Florida designs book
The hall of game, is a 420 wit chrome rims all day (all day)
Parked up on 
Nigga this ain't none of that
Only reason I'm doin' a song wit dude an 'em is 'cause
Can't be no bigga pimp than me nigga

Talkin' bout game
Talkin' bout game
360 degrees of game

[ verse 1: too $hort ]
Whoever try to buy a new benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? a big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the a, straight from the bay
I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin half on my business, keep gettin paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks

Havin ménage-? trois, x-ed out on the celly with todd
""short dog, what's up? "" he told me roger troutman passed
I hollered, my shit about to crash
Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass
Damn! poppin crystal, poured me a glass
Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flo' for yo' ass
This's for my nigga roger, the godfather of futuristic funk
Here's the ganja, get it crunk
Twist the skunk, hit it once
And keep that shit movin and
Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin
I went from rags to riches, bagged bitches, jags and 6's

They tried to pull my playa card
But das ok
They actin' like they don't know us
But das ok
I done emptied out a whole clip
But das ok
I reload it
I done popped another ectasy
But das ok
Some niggas love to hate
But das ok
I smoke the ounce of sticky green
Das ok
I reload it

I never knew you really comin' to this
You on my hit list, snug as a bug in the rug yo I lift this
Snicthin', bitchin' gave you everything I could
And just to think we grew up in the hood
It's all bad, you the only one who knew where the dope was stashed
Can't wait to see you motherfucker I'ma smoke your ass
Want to get the grain but the head to fetch ya
Payback is a mother motherfucker I bet'cha
You paid for the lock down subquantant facilities
Saw the homies who got snitched on
I know you feelin' me

Chrome dubs, only showin' love for thugs
Finger fuckin' my fo' five watchin' sparks from slugs
I'm a ill motherfucker, meanin' I'm sick in the game
I got the thug disease, fetty chico the name
When you can play in the dirty bay
But you better know how to swim (swim)
And get your ass ate the fuck up by the shark with the brim

[Chorus]

Like gang writin' on the wall I'm x-ed the fuck out
Extra doubt, which niggas is next to check out?
I got a fo' five, ar and a couple of grenades
Twist ya ass up quick like french braids
It's the b and to the o and the s and to the s
And the I and to the l and the l and to the I
And the n and to the I, born to die
Four tay we ain't playin', let 'em know how we ride
Startin' with him, what you niggas think it's a joke?
I ain't cheech and four tay ain't chong
But you gettin' smoked

Blaow, how you like me now I'm on a rampage
Fully loaded mack 11, black twelve gauge
Live fo', bustin' at a swift tempo
Tried to told ya, leave your ass and limbo
Remember those crutches left at the phone nigga
Now it's on nigga (cause you a gone nigga)

[Chorus]

Leave you hollow or with flash or die from the gun blast
They can't see me in the beany or black ski mask
Body bags dumped in trash I'm like sideways
Yellow tape on the scene to the slaughter on the highway
My way or no way at all, it's like a pimp's ball
Thought I want it all, got a problem we can brawl
Cops bigger, did he figure he ready to war
Buck! one, two, three niggas on the (floor)

Gang draw, echo three blocks and four
Heard the motherfuckin' blast like it was right next door
Boom! fall out nigga you though you was hit
Take a puff of the blunt say mobb life's the shit
You see a nigga smash off in are-grey and a black six
It's the infamous fetty chico from the bay bitch

I makes the money, I don't let the money make me,
Business as good as usual 'cause it's a great street,
My life is like a see-saw, I had some good times and had some bad times
Nigga was down to his last dime,

I slept in a pissy hallway til' my people came and got me,
Now a nigga ballin' and none of why'all won't top it,

Nigga you muthafuckin' right my 99 you could type,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right I'm bout to paint it with stripes,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right it's see-M-are for life,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right I slit your throat with a knife,

What you really needs to be doin' is peepin' out my background,
Before I stop you from playin', with this blat-blat sound,
Nigga what's happenin' with you, what's up with your boys?
Tell them lil' muthafuckas to stop talkin' that noise,

Hold tight, hold tight, I'm bout to rape you for your life,
Hold tight, hold tight, or you won't make it through the night

Only thought about it once, didn't think a second time,
When a nigga came bustin' at me and runnin' with that nine,
But then I realized, that I'm the tightest nigga that's on the street,
And if I bust back and cause casualties then it'll be sweet,

Been in this for four years, 
and a fifth year approachin', I'm bout to shine,
And ain't no nigga up in this city that can tell me bout mine,
See you blind bruh, talkin' about these diamonds I'm bout to get,

But what I'm bouts to get, 
ain't got a DAMNED thing to do with this shit,
See I live here, you live there, we all live fair,
Talkin' about that Sharp clique, and Ca$h Money, 

you don't look but you stare,
See you done bought you some fight, 
and you done made it most of the night,
So the next thing, you gonna come around here and murder me tonight?

[Bombshell]
See me, I'm the type of nigga that's gonna get down for mine,
I don't be sayin' too much, I light the spark and you dyin',
I ain't lyin', these old bustas they be spyin' on me,
They got they muthafuckin' mind on me, they tryin' to be,

The one and only, mutherfucker to stop,
This here, what I'm doin', I ain't never had shit,
So I ain't gone let you ruin,
Bombshell on the rise,

Look into my eyes,
You's a I know that you know what I'm talkin' bout,
Nashville, New Orleans, niggas ridin' clean,
And nigga ain't talkin' bout nothin' bitch what the fuck you mean?

Baby Capone tell Brady get them tones,
We bringin' it on,
My nigga we in a War Zone,
My gun is ready to bust,

Ain't too many I'm ready to trust,
Sharp clique, represent,
On your head I leave a nick,
Hold tight, 'fore you don't make it through the night,
You bullshittin', you must don't value your life

In the ghetto, I'm living in a ghetto world
In the ghetto (in the ghetto), it's a struggle but I gotta maintain

[Trae]
Welcome to the ghetto, where forever be the same
Hard times, got my people unable to maintain
Everytime I look around, it's somebody doing bad
That'll put you in the grave, for som'ing they never had

Everyday in the hood, it be the same thang
Poverty running my people, so they love pain
And I don't know if it's wrong, but still I know it ain't right
I seen a lot of people die, in the street life

The other day it hit my heart, when I watch the news
A lil' girl got killed, while she was 'sleep in her room
And she ain't deserve to die, cause that's a kid dog
Them niggaz took the life, that she ain't get to live at all

Sometimes I want to help the ghetto, but it ain't gon do a thang
'Cause I know that they ignant, and that's a god damn shame
It's an everyday task, trying to live a good life
Inside of the ghetto, where everybody be shife

[Hook: x 2]

[Yung Redd]
Welcome to the South, niggaz ain't sleep at all
Everybody out on the block, stay ducking them laws
A couple niggaz on parole, hustling by the sto'
I'm telling that ain't the way to go, play your role

But you don't hear me though, this what I'm living fo'
Hustle till I get mine, grind cause I need mo'
Shots release, too late for you to scream peace
This how it is in the street, leaving is obsolete

And still I maintain, seeing the same thang
Sometime I scream, my brain just looking for a change
But day in and day out, I move in and move out
Keep my bidness discrete, I'm on a paper route

I wasn't broke for nothing, still I was learning some'ing
If you ain't been through nothing, then you ain't seen nothing
This how it really is, around my way
Where anybody can get it, anytime of the day

[Lil Boss]
I analyze the block, babies are running round with glocks
Dope in they socks, can't skip hot so fuck the cops
Moving from crumbs to bricks, nigga these slums are thick
I try to tell my lil' niggaz, but they think they slick

These white folks don't play, they gon hot your way
They try to give you twenty years, just for living the wrong way
And who's to say now-a-day, right from wrong
They ain't living how we live, so they can't get in my zone

We get chased home for stones, and laws want to break our bones
In places in and out a high cell, to roam
And that's prolly the reason, we going crazy
Pissed at poverty, cause the system trying to fade me

Lately, I've been trying to stay out of trouble
But it's hard to stop from copping, the sack and flipping the double
Don't catch the wrong route, when you on that Metro
There's a sign in front of the hood, that says Welcome To the Ghetto

[Hook: x 2]

[Spice 1]
I wonder, if heaven got a ghetto
But be	-burning down the be	-block, I put the petal to the medal
Running with my cousins in Texas, Lil' Cross and Big Money
My nigga Trae and Lil' Joe, nigga all action

In the ghetto, I've been riding through the hood for years
And ain't a damn thang changed, mama still shedding tears
Niggaz fresh out the Penn, some niggaz just going in
Some niggaz gon run and stutter, turning they self in

Never seen a black man, flying dope on a plane
But they lock us up for it, shackle us with chains
Welcome to the ghetto, ghetto starts and mob cars
With bullet holes in it, niggaz shot up and scarred

But still living, driven by the game itself
To stay alive in these cold streets, mashing for wealth
Up in this ghetto, O.G.'s P's and see's
Thugs, pimps, playas hit the 6-4's or 3's

Tell a song, sipping Perignon, fuck a Bud Light
Tony said the world is yours, only if you plug right
My God, when they bury me, pray my casket be solid gold
Funeral packed with a separate section for all my hoes
Most niggas choose it and lose it quickly, but I was chose
Cook it and sell it, my mama smell it up in my clothes
Betyour favorite rapper get extorted for his paycheck
Mask on my skull, they ain't identify my face yet
We sticking suckers up, I hope they sticking to the cheddar
You pussy niggas might be rich but you ain't rich forever

Came up in the realest, I know the streets starving
You know we with the business, my niggas go retarded
When we ride
When we ride on our enemies
Never hide from our enemies
'Til we ride our enemies
Fully loaded .45 on my enemies

Immediately cock it back and spray one of you fucking suckers
You off-brand niggas get down with the punishment
It’s D-P-G, Dogg Pound, so who you want it with

With them old-school Tommy gun extended clip
I ride around the city in expensive whips
Should've known that them gangster niggas don’t trip
Flag swinging, me and Deep nigga, yeah we gangbanging
Bringing down the ashes if you niggas flaming
Aim for your dome, head shots, slug shots
Police put me throughout, 2-1 on my mugshot
Crazy-ass niggas, yeah we insane
Put the pistol in your mouth, blow out your brain
Bail out on eight million dollar bond
Soon as I hit the streets, nigga, it’s back on

Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder

When I finger fuck my .45
I hit a nigga right between his eyes
Pull out the heat, make him dance, and do the dougie
Before I blow the back of his shit out, it can get ugly
Yes, y'all, I put his cherry pie on the wall
When I ride on my enemies, niggas know it’s uncut and raw
Mr. Bossalini, you can try to stand guard
But niggas like me be going Taliban hard
I spit grenades and piss bullets
Eat a bitch nigga for breakfast when I aim and pull it
Doing wonders for this bread, I Pillsbury these motherfuckers
When his doughboy die with the heat, I carry in my clutches

Waited all night for him to show

In the line that guy I've been chasing all year
Spending this one alone he said
Give me a break this years been crazy

Spice Girls,"Bah Humbug, now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year
Ski shop encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls Trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens Sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat
Could I join him?
No This time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks No party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year

Spider,"Well you never flew the colours
And I never saw you bend a knee
To any man
But you were never short of brothers
There was always someone
Holding out a helping hand
Well, I remember the summer
We were riding to a show
And our road went on forever
So we were riding nice and slow
And then I heard the band play
And the sun broke through the sky
It was a fine day for a funeral ya
But I never wanted you to die
No one ever wanted you to die
We were watching at the crossroads
When I saw you wiping out
Some metal box just slipped down
Right into the side of you
I was screaming
I was screaming
I was screaming
But nothing was coming out
They always said you were
A dark horse
Because you rode the land alone
But you know I think the real reason
That you were always riding home
And your road goes on forever
The sun will always shine
One day we'll be together
When we cross the final line
When we cross the line
If I turn to you and call you a friend
When all is said and all is done
Will you meet me on the other side

Good morning Mister Railroad Man, what time does your train roll by?

At nine-sixteen, two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five. 
Thank you Mister Railroad Man, I want to watch your train roll by. 

Standing on the platform, smoking a big cigar, 
Waitin' for some old freight train that carries an empty car. 

I rode her down to Danville Town, got stuck on a Danville girl, 
Bet your life she was a pearl, she wore that Danville curl. 

She wore her hat on the back of her head like high-tone people all do,

Baby brothers in trouble and mothers got no cards
The oldest of the pack got to bring the food back
I'm packin a magnum on one of the hottest corners, movin sacks
Duckin from one-times, life in the blind got me pointin 9's
Squeezing triggers for freedom and dimes

They said they heard he was pullin in the west
