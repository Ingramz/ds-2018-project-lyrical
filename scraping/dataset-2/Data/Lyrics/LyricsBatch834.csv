Peggy Lee,"I am the passenger and I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah, the bright and hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight

I am the passenger, I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripped backsides
And everything looks good tonight

Singing, la la la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
We'll see the city's ripped backsides

We'll see the bright and hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine so bright
Stars made for us tonight

Oh, the passenger
How, how he rides
Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides

He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the sign and hollow sky
He sees the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive

And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
'Cause it just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and see what's mine

Singing, la la la

Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window side

He sees the things that he knows are his
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the city sleep at night
He sees the stars are out tonight

And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
So let's ride and ride and ride and ride

Peggy Lee,"Didn't he ramble, he rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble
He rambled till the butcher cut him down

His feet was in the market place, his head was in the street
Lady pass him by, said, look at the market meat
He grabbed her pocket book, and said I wish you well
She pulled out a forty-five, said I'm head of personnel

Didn't he ramble, I said he rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
Didn't he ramble, oh didn't he ramble
He rambled till the butcher shot him down

He slipped into the cat house, made love to the stable
Madam caught him cold, said I'll pay you when I be able
Six months had passed, and she stood all she could stand
She said buddy when I'm through with you
Ole groundhog gonna be shakin yo' hand

And didn't he ramble, he rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town

Peggy Lee,"What can I say dear after I say I'm sorry,
What can I do to prove it to you that I'm sorry,

Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel, I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands

Oh, Autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, Autumn in New York

On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York

Spring is here, so blow your job
Throw your job away

Now's the time to trust to your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait

In our mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains, we'll laugh at the weather

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook while I stand looking

Beans could get no keener
Reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home

Peggy Lee,"There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about, 
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present 
My future just passed. 

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me 
My future just passed. 

Stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance 
You can at least do this, 
Sometimes a boy encounters resistance 
Help me to win this miss.

Look in my heart, there is no confusion there 
Now that I'm loving, I'm living at last,

How is the world treating you?

How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

Probably I'm boring you

Peggy Lee,"Don't save your kisses, pass them around
You'll find my reason is logically sound
Who's gonna know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today

Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a Queen
You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions, what would they all mean
A hundred years from today

So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one beneath the Sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way

My fleeting moments of tenderness
I sang of true love, I've played guitars
Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars
This time's the last time, this time it's new
Love as a pastime for me is through
I've had my moments, my big bad moments

When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die

Then add a smile and let it bubble up

Peggy Lee,"Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci

But my heart says, 'No, no, you're not, you're not the same'

Peggy Lee,"Raindrops keep falling on my head
Just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed,
Nothing seems to fit.
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling...

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said, I didn't like the way, he got things done.
Sleeping on the job.
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling...

But there's one thing, I know:
The blues, they send to meet me won't defeat me,
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me.

Raindrops keep falling on my head,
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red,
Crying's not for me.
And, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining,
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me!",Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,2008
Peggy Lee,"You're walkin' along the street or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big

You're lunching at Twenty-One and watchin' your diet
Declining a Charlotte ruse, accepting a fig
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
But when a lover you discover at the gate, my friend
Invite her in without a second look

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand
You suddenly hear a bell and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand

This could be the start of something very big
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me and see
This could be the start of something wonderful
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me and see

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working.
She'll probably stop for lunch and give me a call.
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing, on the wall, that's all.

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said ""Daddy oh don't you dare""
""He gives me fever with his kisses""
""Fever when he holds me tight""
""Fever, I'm his missus""
""Daddy won't you treat him right?""

We give you fever when we kiss you

I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much

Are you still mine?

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh, ""Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me""

Two sleepy people with nothing to say, and too much in love to break away.

Do you remember the reason we married in the fall?

Peggy Lee with the Jud Conlon Singers ,"(Ghost) Riders In the Sky
Vaughn Monroe 

Peak Billboard position # 1 in 1949
Monroe may not have sung it precisely this way  but a recording by him was not 
available so the words and music herein are taken from the sheet music as written 
by Stan Jones 
Monroes' version, as well as competing versions by Peggy Lee (# 2), Bing Crosby 
(#14), and Burl Ives (# 21) were all charted as just ""Riders In the Sky""
Later, The Ramrods took it to # 30 in 1961 with the parenthetical (Ghost) added, 
as did the Baja Marimba Band (#52 in 1966) and The Outlaws (#31 in 1981)
Lawrence Welk used the original title on his # 87 in 1961.


An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

I wish I were a princess
And if I were a princess
I'd make you my prince

I'd pass the greatest law
In history
A lovely little law
I hope you'd never break
And it would make you fall in love with me
And if I were a princess
The next thing I would do
Is plan a celebration in my arms
And what a happy day
When people hear you say
""My princess I'm asking for your hand""
I wish I were a princess
I wish I were a princess
I'd have you sit beside me
So handsome so bold
I wish I were a princess
And you were my prince
Oh we'd live happily ever after
As in days of old

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

Peggy Scott-Adams,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...

How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things
Where di you hide your Halo?

Where did you lose your wings?
Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?

If Ikissed you would it be a sin?
I amonly human but you are so divine
When did you leave Heave, angel mine?

Peggy Seeger,"Farewell, you northern hills, you mountains all goodbye
Moorlands and stony ridges, crags and peaks, goodbye
Glyder Fach farewell, cold big Scafell, cloud-bearing Suilven
Sun-warmed rocks and the cold of Bleaklow's frozen sea
The snow and the wind and the rain of hills and mountains
Days in the sun and the tempered wind and the air like wine
And you drink and you drink till you're drunk on the joy of living 

Farewell to you, my love, my time is almost done
Lie in my arms once more until the darkness comes
You filled all my days, held the night at bay, dearest companion
Years pass by and they're gone with the speed of birds in flight
Our lives like the verse of a song heard in the mountains
Give me your hand and love and join your voice with mine
And we'll sing of the hurt and the pain and the joy of living

Farewell to you, my chicks, soon you must fly alone
Flesh of my flesh, my future life, bone of my bone
May your wings be strong may your days be long safe be your journey
Each of you bears inside of you the gift of love
May it bring you light and warmth and the pleasure of giving
Eagerly savour each new day and the taste of its mouth
Never lose sight of the thrill and the joy of living

Take me to some high place of heather, rock and ling
Scatter my dust and ashes, feed me to the wind
So that I may be part of all you see, the air you are breathing
I'll be part of the curlew's cry and the soaring hawk,
The blue milkwort and the sundew hung with diamonds
I'll be riding the gentle breeze as it blows through your hair
Reminding you how we shared in the joy of living",Joy of Living,1996
Peggy Seeger,"My old man was a good old man
Skilled in the moulding trade
In the stinking heat of the iron foundry
My old man was made
Down on his knees in the moulding sand
He wore his trade like a company brand
He was one of the cyclops' smoky band
Yes, that was my old man

My old man wasn't really old
It's just that I was young
And anybody over twelve years old
Was halfway to the tomb
He was loyal to his workmates all his life
Gave his pay packet to his wife
Had a few jars on a Saturday night
Yes, that was my old man

My old man was a union man
Fought hard all his days
He understood the system
And was wise to the boss' ways
He says, you want what's yours by right
You have to struggle with all your might
They'll rob you blind if you don't fight
Yes, that was my old man

My old man was a proud old man
At home on the foundry floor
Until the day they laid him off
And showed him to the door
They gave him his card, said, things are slack
We've got a machine can learn the knack
Of doing your job, so don't come back
The end of my old man

My old man he was fifty-one
What was he to do?
A craftsman moulder on the dole
In nineteen thirty-two
He felt he'd given all he could give
So he did what thousands of others did
Abandoned hope and the will to live
They killed him, my old man

My old man he is dead and gone
Now I am your old man
And my advice to you, my son
Is to fight back while you can
Watch out for the man with the silicon chip
Hold on to your job with a good firm grip
'Cause if you don't you'll have had your chips
The same as my old man
",My Old Man,1996
Peggy Seeger,"With our nets and gear we're faring
     On the wild and wasteful ocean.
     Its there that we hunt and we earn our bread
     As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O it was a fine and a pleasant day
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring
As a cabinboy on a sailing lugger
For to go and hunt the shoals of herring

O the work was hard and the hours long
And the treatment, sure it took some bearing
There was little kindness and the kicks were many
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank
I was cook and I'd a quarter sharing
And I used to sleep standing on my feet
And I'd dream about the shoals of herring

O we left the homegrounds in the month of June
And to Canny Shiels we soon were bearing
With a hundred cran of silver darlings
That we'd taken from the shoals of herring

Now you're up on deck, you're a fisherman
You can swear and show a manly bearing
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows
While you're searching for the shoals of herring

In the stormy seas and the living gales
Just to earn your daily bread you're daring
From the Dover Straits to the Faroe Islands
As you're following the shoals of herring

O I earned my keep and I paid my way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes
We were sailing after shoals of herring",The Shoals of Herring,1996
Peggy Seeger,"A is for altar where we go astray

G for girlhood that's gawky and gone
And a H fed up housewife that's singing this song

You wake up tomorrow, it all starts again

U is for underwear, grimy and soiled
V for those things that you peel, chop and boil
W for woman and washing machine

We've got no union, it's eight days a week
They're crammed into seven, I'm out on my feet
So much to do, where should I begin?
But I got all my lifetime to finish it in

W for wings, if I had them I'd fly
X marks the spot where I sit down and cry
Why Z for yours truly, I've gone on too long
And so has the system and so has this song

Wearily, it's merely a good woman's day
Cooking and cleaning and tidying away
If ever you finish, remember that when

You'd go back where you started and sing it again

Peggy Seeger,"Old friend, comrade of mine
Once again you're on my mind
There's always a place, there's always a time
To think of days gone by

We spent too long apart
And there's so much in my heart
I want to say before we say goodbye

Your life and mine entwined
With the music and the songs
Our future was set from the moment that we met
We were old long friends

The work that quit our play
Carried us away then brought us home
Brought us home again

Love's a game, you never made a claim
Or tried to play that game with me
That set you apart with your own place in my heart
Where you will always be

As a woman among men
It was hard to find a friend
Then you were there and with you I was free

We traveled far by scooter then by car
From Paris down to Rome
In Germany we clowned
In Switzerland broke down, we were so young then

We parted and we aged
But our rainbow didn't fade
We remained, we remained old friends

Once again you're on my mind
There's always a place, there's always a time

We spent too long apart
And there's so much in my heart
I want to say before we say goodbye

Now you are gone and like the music
And the song you've come in to my mind

You will never die

We'll keep you with us here

Peggy Seeger,"I've been over Snowdon, I've slept upon Crowdon
I've camped by the Waynestones as well
I've sunbathed on Kinder, been burned to a cinder
And many more things I can tell
My rucksack has oft been me pillow
The heather has oft been me bed
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

Ch:     I'm a rambler, I'm a rambler from Manchester way
        I get all me pleasure the hard moorland way
        I may be a wageslave on Monday
        But I am a free man on Sunday

The day was just ending and I was descending
Down Grinesbrook just by Upper Tor
When a voice cried ""Hey you"" in the way keepers do
He'd the worst face that ever I saw
The things that he said were unpleasant
In the teeth of his fury I said
""Sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead""

He called me a louse and said ""Think of the grouse""
Well i thought, but I still couldn't see
Why all Kinder Scout and the moors roundabout
Couldn't take both the poor grouse and me
He said ""All this land is my master's""
At that I stood shaking my head
No man has the right to own mountains
Any more than the deep ocean bed

I once loved a maid, a spot welder by trade
She was fair as the Rowan in bloom
And the bloom of her eye watched the blue Moreland sky
I wooed her from April to June
On the day that we should have been married
I went for a ramble instead
For sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

So I'll walk where I will over mountain and hill
And I'll lie where the bracken is deep
I belong to the mountains, the clear running fountains
Where the grey rocks lie ragged and steep
I've seen the white hare in the gullys
And the curlew fly high overhead
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead.",Manchester Rambler,2000

To take the sweet and pleasant air
Who should I spy but a fair young lady
Her cheeks being like a lily fair

I stepped up to her, right boldly asking
Would she be a sailor's wife?
""Oh no, kind sir, I'd rather tarry
And remain single for all my life""

""Tell me, kind Miss and what makes you differ
From the rest of womankind?""
""I see you're fair, you are young, you're handsome
And for to marry might be inclined""

""The truth, kind Sir, I will plainly tell you
I might have married three years ago
To one John Riley who left this country
He is the cause of all my woe""

""Come along with me, don't you think on Riley
Come along with me to some distant shore
We will set sail for Pennsylvania
Adieu, sweet England, forevermore""

I'll not go with you to that distant shore
My heart's with Riley, I will ne'er forget him
Although I may never see him no more""

He give her kisses, one two and three
Says, ""I am Riley, your own true lover
That's been the cause of your misery""

I would climb a hillah, I'll paddle to Priscilla,

your little fingers, unhappy little girl blue.Sit there
and count the raindrops falling on you,It's time you
knew,All you can count on are the raindrops that fall on

surrender,Your hopes are getting slender, why won't
somebody send a tenderBlue boy to cheer up little girl

Wait, I see a chance at the window
Fate, mustn't always decide
I'll follow through with or without you
But I will be all right

Starting over isn't easy
It gets tougher every time, but to
Live and learn without getting burned
Is like not living at all",Reflections,1994

Or mocking jest
Tenderly beguiling

Countin the towns flashin by 
And a night that's full of soul 
With light in my head

From the bonds that hold me fast 
And the chains all around me 
Will fall away at last

And the friends that our hearts make
We can no longer see desires within
Our eyes roam free

To be the person that others would need
Hard to find a purse sometimes

Counting the cost of pride
Holding the truth so quietly inside
There's a fear to speak against the tide
Now we see the guiding hand in the night

You can go all around the world
They'll give you golden rings and pearls
You search for your dreams
When you get there, there not always what they seem

But now I got my face in it
Run around chasin' it

Everybody's screw faced
Looking like so raw
Pressure and it won't stop
Pushing up my heart rate
Arguments and attitude

Woke up shivering and
Swimming in my own piss

One drove home from Italy, is y'all feelin me?
Be a mistress to none, but all good to some
Let me break you off a little, show you how it's done
Eyes trip for this goddess, gambino got your funds
And some fish are coppin flights for me to Reno

Rollin a blunt, still drivin, lookin at movies

Professional but still keep it real like Allen Iverson
I'm liver than Jay, Dave and Kathy and Regis
Been on more MTV shows than Butthead and Beavis
Keep a stash with the gas money, fast money, me and Slo Down, huh
We almost had to buy up the town
It's like a movie, oohhweee, doobies in a jacuzzi

I've got a plan for what I'm gonna do to you
So hot!
You're gonna steam and scream
And vibrate like a string I'm plucking.
Kiss your fevered little brow,
Pinch your cheeks till you say ""ow"".
And I can hardly wait to show you how

Peninha,"Tudo era apenas uma brincadeira
E foi crescendo, crescendo, me absorvendo
E de repente eu me vi assim completamente seu

Vi a minha força amarrada no seu passo
Vi que sem você não há caminho, eu não me acho
Vi um grande amor gritar dentro de mim
Como eu sonhei um dia

Quando o meu mundo era mais mundo
E todo mundo admitia
Uma mudança muito estranha
Mais pureza, mais carinho mais calma, mais alegria
No meu jeito de me dar

Quando a canção se fez mais clara e mais sentida
Quando a poesia realmente fez folia em minha vida
Você veio me falar dessa paixão inesperada
Por outra pessoa

Eu só quero que você se encontre
Saudade até que é bom
É melhor que caminhar vazio

Tenho um sonho em minhas mãos

Life is the most precious thing you can lose
While you were here the fun was never ending
Laugh a minute was only beginning

Ever get the feeling you can't go on
Just remember whose side it is that you're on
You've got friends with you 'til the end
If you're ever in a tough situation
We'll be there with no hesitation
Brotherhood's our rule we cannot bend

When you're feeling too close to the bottom
You know who it is you can count on
Someone will pick you up again
We can conquer anything together
All of us are bonded forever
If I die, you die that's the way it is

With my lead boots nailed to the floor
Dancing the best that I can
Sweets-took the pain away
I saw a cold death at the end of the line
So I started to pray
Up towards the sky but knew no one would
Answer me. I asked the trees why they
Grew toward the sun. I asked the clouds
And they rained down bad luck on me
Oh my god why hath thou forsaken me
I asked the teachers who taught me rules
To obey. I asked the gaes and prophets
Through time. Came up nothing but
A hole where my faith had laid no
Reason, no rite nothing feels fine tonight
Crime it was a price to pay
I found the hole world as guilty as I
It took the danger away
Hate-it was so easy to do
You just directed all your anger at fear
And then you follow it through
I went to churches and schools to decide
For me. I went to prophets to plea for
My life. Went to my parents who gave
This dark life to me. I don't need to
I don't want to. I don't want to

Families are breaking up cause underpaids can't make ends meet
The establishment has put their money underground
Cause they all know what's coming down
A lucky precious few with money in their banks
Can't imagine what it's like to find yourself in homeless ranks
They've got no conscience for the ones who won't survive
The time for payback has arrived
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go Or your never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die
FIGHT TILL YOU DIE
All alone in your own society
outside are the cries of lives in misery
an evil plot of a false democracy
subjugating souls just dying to be free
Look all around you there's a war that's going on
A struggle against the odds that's breaking out and must be won
They're getting ready with the weapons they have found
Take inspiration from the sound
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go Or your never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die

As we know it could be stolen away-we didn't see it coming 'til it

Watch it go down it doesn't matter to you but when it comes to an end
Well then you will know the truth

Troygt the corners of the wood

Bleddin from it's vains of nails
Lived the pain that never ends
The tree of death

Since you were from the dirth
And raised too high
Of what life is worth

When you ease your brain
See your dreams over
Fence your eager to fly forever

Reaching trough the gun
Role the trigger run
That's no reason to fly
Forever fly

Few minutes of fallin drops
To dry the streams of your blood
You leave your god

As the mountain on which I close my eyes
To embrace the future of my last

Diggin your own grave,
Do you think you're brave?

I rule you blind
I read your mind
I can hear you cry,when your fly!
Over, Over the line

Raining by that destroying forests and all living

Traces of nuclear remain will lead the way to our racers dissolution

The trenches are full with corpses cheated innocent bodies lie

Mangled organs in minefields the battle was to die
The vanishing of our planet, you may hear the cries
With those insatiables leading us we won't die by our wanted fate
Surreptitious suspicious plans destroyed my life in hate

Kiss of hell takes you away
Through the lights of eden

The fear of death leaves you
To raise your soul to heaven

Life is death death is life
Die live and born

Many other rich junk feeding

How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.

He promised her money and other fine things. 

And, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
But no money he brought her nor other fine things. 
""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know."" 

She jumped up behind him and away they did go,
But down to the river where deep waters flow. 
""John Lewis, John Lewis, want you tell to me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?"" 

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell to you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind."" 
""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife."" 

He hugged her and kissed her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown. 
Then he got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side. 

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found. 
Then two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away. 

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank. 
And they call for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he can see her face.

No friends or relations would go on his bail.",Omie Wise,1971

",Once I Had a Sweetheart,1973
Pentangle,"Well I married me a wife
She gave me trouble all my life
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, rain and snow
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
She came a running on down the stairs
Combing back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose, as a rose
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
Well I ain't got no use for your red apple juice
And I'm not gonna be treated this a way
This a way this a way
And I'm not gonna be treated this way
I see you sitting in the shade counting every dime I've made

Pentangle,"The trees they grow high and the leaves they do grow green
Many is the time my true love I've seen
Many an hour I've watched him all alone
He's young but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
You have married me to a boy who is too young
I'm twice twelve and he is but fourteen
He's young but he's daily growing

Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I've married you to a great Lord's son
He'll be a man to you when I am dead and gone
He's young, but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, if you see fit
We'll send my love to college for one year yet
Tie blue ribbons all around his head
To let the ladies know that he's married

One day I was looking over my father's castle wall
Saw all the boys aplaying with the ball
My own true love was the flower of them all
He's young, but he's daily growing

At the age of fourteen he was a married man
Age of fifteen the father of a son
Age of sixteen on his grave the grass was green
Cruel death had put an end to his growing

I'll make my love a shroud at the hole in so fine
Every stitch I put in it, the tears come trickling down
Once I had a true love but not narrow one
But I'll watch out his son 'cause he's growing

",The Trees They Do Grow High,1973
Pentangle,"Well I once could have married the king's third son

And a-go along with a me
I will take you to where the grass grows green
On the banks of the River Dee.""

To keep me from slavery?""2
""Well I have seven ships
They will soon be at land
And they at your command shall be.""

She took her two babes by the hand
And gave them kisses three
""Sit still at home you darling little babes,
Keep your father sweet company.""

Now she dressed herself in her very best
Like a high-born lady was she
She shimmered and she shivered3 and she proudly stepped
As they walked by the banks of the sea

Well she hadn't been gone but a short, short time
Until she wept for sor'4)
""I would give all the gold in this round world
Just to see my babes once more.""

Well if you had all the gold and the silver too
That ever did cross the sea
You never would be at land anymore
And your babes you will never more see

Well they hadn't been sailing but a short, short time
About two weeks, three or four
When the ship sprang a leak and they were doomed
And they were far away from the shore

""I see bright hills of Heaven my dear
Where angels come and go
I see bright hills, that's Hell my dear
Where you and I must go.""

""Oh I wish I was back to my house carpenter
I'm sure he would treat me well
But here I am in the raging sea
And my soul is bound for Hell.""

(Lay the bent to the bonnie broom)
Two daughters were the babes she bore
(Fa la la la la la la la la la)

alternating with each of the lines below>

As one grew bright as is the sun,
So coal black grew the elder one.

A knight came riding to the lady's door,
He'd travelled far to be their wooer.

He courted one with gloves and rings,
But he loved the other above all things.

Oh sister will you go with me
To watch the ships sail on the sea?

She took her sister by the hand
And led her down to the North Sea strand.

And as they stood on the windy shore
The dark girl threw her sister o'er.

Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
Crying, ""Sister, reach to me your hand!

""Oh Sister, Sister, let me live,
And all that's mine I'll surely give.""

""(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more,
But thou shalt never come ashore.""

And there she floated like a swan,
The salt sea bore her body on.

Two minstrels walked along the strand
And saw the maiden float to land.

They made a harp of her breastbone,
Whose sound would melt a heart of stone.

They took three locks of her yellow hair,
And with them strung the harp so rare.

They went into her father's hall
To play the harp before them all,

But when they laid it on a stone
The harp began to play alone.

The first string sang a doleful sound:
""The bride her younger sister drowned.""

The second string as that they tried,
In terror sits the black-haired bride.

The third string sang beneath their bow,
""And surely now her tears will flow

Pentangle,"As I did travel all on a journey
Over the wayside and under a dark moon
Hanging above a mountain

I spied a young man riding a fine horse
Chasing a white hart and all through the woodland
Head of a hunting party

And there followed after ten kings and queens
Laughing and joking, the white hart they'd seen
Bloodied running into the bushes

I plume to his helmet, a quiver and a bow
There's nowhere to run now, there's no place to go
The hunt is cast and ready

Still farther I journeyed through the hills and the valleys
Until upon the verge of despair I sat and rested
And there did pass a princely knight poursuite [pursued] by a lady
And this she did say:

""Oh may I ask you kind sir where you are going?
And pray tell unto me sir why you do hurry
Strange that I should meet you here, come sit by me"".

""I have here a magic horn to deliver
And one drop from this silver and gold horn I hold, sir
Shall prove all to be false, lovers beware!""

""The gift that you bear for your brother the king
I gladly would carry to the banquet this even'
What fair sport this would be for the maidens at court.""

Wearily I crossed the stream to the castle
Where I found shelter from the cold wintry wind
And food did I have and plenty
But the Lord and Lady seemed so sad
For these words they did say unto each other:

""My good lord, all off to war in thy armor
Leaving me here alone to weep and to worry
Take care lest misadventure
Shall overcome thy kindly heart
My good lord, all off to war in thy armor.""

""My lady, you have no need for to worry
I'll return victorious and true unto thee
Take care, lest misadventure
Shall stain your heart and lead to woe
My fair lady you have no need for to worry.""

. . . la la la . . .

While underneath the spreading oak a knight with white device
Upon a shield of black, and deep in grief and sorrow sings
His unrequited love

""Young noblewoman riding by, pray tell me have you seen
Queen Azelda the fairest maid, in company she rides
For I swear to have revenge.""

A thousand days have come and passed, the Lord returns this night
The victor from the bloody wars proven his fearsome might
As ever he would claim

But fate has played its wanton game, the circle come full turn
The magic horn has done its work, cried ""Falseness is found out!""
The sorrowed quest is over.

",Hunting Song,1992
Pentangle,"In Bruton town there lived a farmer
Who had two sons and one daughter dear. 

One told his secrets to no other,
but to his brother this he said,
""I think our servant courts our sister,
I think they have a mind to wed.
I'll put an end to all their courtship,
I'll send him silent to his grave."" 

A day of hunting was prepared,
Where only bush and briars grew.
And there they did this young man murder,
And in the brake his body threw. 

""Now welcome home, my dear young brothers,
Our serving man, is he behind?""
""We've left him where we've been a-hunting,
""We've left him where no man can find."" 

As she lay dreaming on her pillow,
She thought she saw her own true love;
She dreamt she saw him standing by her,
She saw his coat was red with blood. 

""Don't weep for me, my dearest jewel,
Don't weep for me nor care nor pine,
For your two brothers killed me cruel-
In such a place you may me find. 

""Rise up, my love, tomorrow morning,
Go straightway to that brake you know,
For there you'll find my body lying,
Where only bush and briars grow."" 

She went out early in the morning,
And in the garden brake she stood
And there she found her own dear jewel,
All covered o'er in a gore of blood. 

She took a kerchief from her pocket,
And wiped his eyes though he was blind.
""Because he was my own true lover,
My own true love and a friend of mine."" 

Three days and nights she did sit by him,
And her poor heart was filled with woe,
Till cruel hunger crept upon her,
And home she was obliged to go.

To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go

Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell

And likewise a silk handkerchief to tie up his head
To tie up his head as sailors will do
And he said my pretty Polly will you come too

Now this maid being young and foolish she thought it no harm
For to lie into bed to keep herself warm
And what was done there I will never disclose
But I wish that short night had been seven long years

Next morning this sailor so early arose
And into my apron three guineas did throw
Saying take this I will give and more I will do
If you'll be my Polly wherever I go

And if it's a girl she will wear a gold ring
She will wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame

The third string sang beneath their bow,

Penumbra,"I've got to leave now
Leave this frozen and overcrowded town,
And catch the first train,
Not knowing its destination.
I 'm gazing at people
Each of them, those lifeless things,
As I travel through the
Moody and rainy autumn night.

Metal grates on metal,
The shrilly scream of the
Brakes wake me. People get down,
Staring at me strangely,
I glare at them
And they hasten out,

I can feel vibrations running through my body
As the machine starts again...
All alone in the car,
The last station is near,
I find it empty,
I'm alone with the night.
Guided by the echoes
Of melancholia,
I'm walking up the dimly lit path.

I'm swallowed by the cool
And obscure night,
The wild and cold surroundings
Graze my skin.
Excited by my senses,
I run towards a glade.
Trees in the moonlight thow
Bars upon the ground.

Above me, the full moon is shining
And I shoot a sharp look at it.
My eyes are crying,
How could I resist it?
My throat, freed from its lump,
Utters a long howl.
It's been a long time since
I was no longer Human.",Lycanthrope,1999

And find a fresh plate to rotate to make the be	-boys get aches
And me and you, the super MC's to get the cake

(Double K)
Word up! I called the posse, we can all roll out,
Cause once we step up in the party, yo we make the ladies shout
People Under the Stairs, yeah and you know we got the clout
Packed up my records, rolled up the blunt

(Thes One)
I got out the black book, tried to call up this stunt
She wasn't home, so I paged her, left the celly on roam
And we out to the night, right on Pico
Rolled down the street, stopped at the red light

(Double K)
Kept on going, made a right on Sierra Bonita,
Yo Thes, where's your fake ID? Ya know we need a
Little bit of liquor for the night

(Thes One)
I was born in 1974!

(Double K)
Yeah, right!

(Thes One)
Word!  Corona represent just enough to get me screamin
Like them other latin brothers whose intoxicated demon's
Tape bumps lovely, we keep it goin, ain't mine on deck
The backseat complete, goin and goin

(Double K)
Turned up the beats and hopped on the ten
Talkin lot about the pigeons that we bout to see again
Yo I'm tryin to stop drinkin, but nigga pass the cup!
This fool Thes is freestylin, almost passed the exit up

(Thes One)
Because the drinkin and drivin's a guaranteed no no
Cause with the bottle in my hand, it's fuckin up my rhyme flow
I went right, kinda slow, at the bottom of the ramp
Ten car caravan, undisputed champion

(Double K)
Pulled up to the place, had to find a parking space
This ugly bitch was looking at us so I give the gas face

(Thes One)
Hey yo, her friends was butt too but they jocked this big crew
Told the bitch to jump in the jeep, I'll take you to the zoo

(Double K)
Ha ha!  Word
Her head was all big
They should've been at the zoo though

Got up to the line (five dollars please!)
Oh we're with the DJ (nope, five dollars please!)
Bitch, we're with the DJ (FIVE DOLLARS PLEASE!)
I'ma have to beat your ass
(alright just let me stamp your hand, get in there!)

I was the first one in and the crew was behind
So I kept on walkin, couldn't waste no time
Bumped into this white guy that I knew
He offered me a brew, I was like fuck it
Took it to the head, now I'm through
So he laughed, rolled another one up
This fool Thes is pushin it, puttin gin in my cup
Now I'm toked back, can't walk worth shit
He lamp lit the J and I hit that shit
Took about a hundred pulls, at least that's how it felt
Chillin with my boy, at least that's how it felt
Realized I was buggin then I saw Mike's pops
When I decide to spark the beedie and relaxed at the spot
Yo, to the DJ, throw on 2Pac
I walked back in and showed the stamp, felt like I was shot
Oh my God!  Saw this brown skinned cutie
With a big booty, titties big as hell, looked like Tootie
Hey girl, how you doin, oh shit I looked back
My nigga Thes is on the mic about to bust another rap

Yo, this fool Thes,
Ay man you bout to rap huh
(Hey is that Thes?)
Do it do it!

(Thes One)
Mic Check one two, how do you do, I'm Thes!
The party honored guest cause the crew gets blessed
Never have I stressed, ask my man J Quest
I rock the mic possessed when the beat's compressed
I rotate grills or analogs at best
It's the true be	-Boy and that always gets respect
Pass the Corona, keep two in the icechest
Pull a girl like a plug cause I'm finessed
Find me when I seem sexually represesed
I treat em really good til they get obsessed
They actin kinda funny and they get bloodtests
If they actin ill I go and take the next best
You MC's be rappin funny, I'm not impressed
Standin like products of parental incest
But son, my tape's for sale so I hope you invest
Sunny up on skills, that's what I suggest
If you think you're fresh, you catch a litmus test
Drop some fresh rhymes, that is my request
You got no heart, let me lay you down to rest
I invoke the hiphop citizen's arrest
My name is.... yo man

(Double K)
Hey that fool done kicked the cord out!

(Thes One)
Plug me back in yo!

(Double K)
Ay, what's up?  What's up?
Man, fuck these motherfuckers

Party's over,
Everyone out of my house!

Trying to find Smiley's house, thank G-d we made it
Yo, blunts, broads and beats, keepin' low through the streets
And niggas givin' us pounds cause of these dope-ass sounds
We run aground like ships, over these beats I flip
The bass is hittin' so hard that your CD skips
Well check it out, make sure it doesn't happen again
I got my grip on it, so turn it up to volume ten
Volume ten, word, like that brother from LA
Lord Radio and Hellbot be streakin' through the Bay
We all-citiy like the Mayor, you see my name
I'm more fresh shit, the creep tailor,
The G for international ladies like a sailor,
Like a sailor I get drunk and bust flows to the beat
Like my man J, I feel the Agony in Defeat
Cause sucka-chumps want to test, step like we don't know
We doin, we doin shows in San Francisco
That's right young writer, got a hit for all you biters
Time to bless another track we getting rid of the whack
We put em in the back with the other Tapenze shit
Beats hit hard, make the trolly do olly
Old folks grabs their talus and vacate the bay
See a name in Northern Lights, there's love in Double K
We getting wild for the night, we getting wild for the night
And it all weighs down, what, what
 
On A Warm San Francisco Night
Yo, rocking shows for you and your crew
On A Warm San Francisco Night

We's drinkin, smoking, more smoking, more drinking
Didn't think about the morning hangover, just didn't want to be sober
Yo Radio, tell me how did you feel, 
Like I'll never catch a DUI, get gas,
Peel, make a left, yo it's the Double K
Ay, ay what's up
Roll up the windows and spark the joint
Yo, you didn't have to ask twice
Smokin on top of the hill, so we can peep the city life
I'm on award tour, we got it locked like Alcatraz 
Doin the San Francisco show I'm sure you realize
Ring the drums like Harvey Ray's son try it
Better look next time, try to step the beat
You in the Bay punk, I guess you ain't about LA
Yo Double K, tell ?em who's unique with the beats
BUTS shows and San Francisco treats
A San Francisco treat is like some Riceroni
Put it in your mouth and let it run down the middle just like Moni
Phony homey, can never rock the party
Your whack-ass crew gets called out
See I play the rod-roddy come on now
To the south punks have you feelin the concrete
Have you askin questions from your hands to your feet
You don't want to do the shit that I'm offering
Sayin that Pete can't rock your city, (what) who, you make a fool
Very often we win, yo very sudden we lose
Spice rockin' yo whole mother-fuckin city

Yo, rollin blunts and doin the do (the do, the do)

(Double K)
I got, ten MC's held up in a line
Cause all these dudes told me that they knew how to rhyme
So which one will it be that I choose to test first
The way he grabbed the mic showed signs of a pussy and even worse
He was talkin bout a gat that wasn't tucked in his waist
So I ???? into the next sucka face (next)
This fool was pretty dope, told him, keep up the good work
Gave him a pound and a pin, moved on to this next jerk
Hey yo, dude looked like Usher with his chest all exposed
Bustin bout bitches he be hittin and his stupid ass clothes
Bitch smile on his face like there were hands in the air wavin'
But I was anticipatin with Satan to see him bakin'
Under the authority of someone lower than me
Started gettin tired (yawn!), skipped three, now here's the seventh MC
Looked like a pretty cool guy, but sounded like Treach (Hay! Ho!)
Moved around all fast screamin with weapons around his neck
It was like a fuckin joke, me and the gang got a good laugh,
He got all hot, tried to dulo, we beat his fuckin ass like
(sounds of fighting)
Number eight was a female, at least that's how I figured,
Until it started rappin, sounded like one of my niggas,
God damn this that, and all the guns in the world
Harder than most niggas on the mic, even had a Jheri Curl (damn!)
Sent her to Jenny Jones, for the little makeover,
Told her, ""be back in two weeks!"" you see all I wanted to do was bone her
Word, she's out like yesterday's six pack
So let's get back to the last two, yo they from the same crew,
What should we do, Thes said he knew them niggas from some open mic spot,
They tried to gun up, got cut up, so here's round 2

""Yea you money!  I'm talkin to you!""
""You got a battle rap?  Battle me!""
""Wassup?!""
""Battle me!""
""Wassup?!""

(Thes One)
Yo!  What would you do if I could prove you didn't exist and it was true
Like ??? solidified proof of your essence
Of you in the spoof of your birth
Now I guess that would lesson your worth to the dirt and the earth
And the leaf, now I leave you alone without belief that your really here
And assist you beneath your fear
An endearing tear would fall if all that I said was true,
Am I right or ???, too complex for quote
I'll have the final say,
Like the rope to the boat to the dock, you're not free yet, man
You're sick, stuck, caught, sick in the head,
Stuck to the bed, you're dumbfed
Diseased with that mononuclear, what I look like money?!
That latin listening to Coolio?  So I ask,
What was your mom's task when she had you?
If fully she knew that through all of her pain
Her baby was born without brain and insane and just plain,
no style!  No smile, your memories are worth a shitpile to me
You believe that you're free?!!  Man, free from your mom,
Free from the man and most of all free from me but you see,
I've caught you!  My bad you don't really exist,
So I got to, explain this so when I tell you how not to,
You won't do it, I'm screwin your thinkin!
I know I exist and I prove it cause I'm listening to you
But I ask, what if God was an evil genius who only made you believe you were 
true?
And your life was nothing man!  Just a really long dream
And when you die you'll start a whole new life, a whole new dream
But that was just a dream, and it seems man you can't break out the cycle
Am I crazy?  Go to your church and ask your white God if I'm right though,
Whatever he replies will be lies, we've already established this evil,
When I'm lying, you don't exist but merely as emotion and perceival,
Believe you'll be round tomorrow kid, yo,
You've borrowed time with no entrance,
And since you're a dream I can mentally put on the pinch
And you disappear in an instant,
Fool what?!  What?!

Knights will come, be advised
They'll come for them
Be advised they'll come
Someone's sure that they'll be here

Yo Thes, what (what up?)
Can you rock the mic?

[Thes One]
A ha ha, my mellow my man, it's like ridin' a bike
Uh, Double K

[Double K]
What's Up?

[Thes One]
Can you rock it?

[Double K]
Like ridin' a bike, but only with training wheels
So what, shoot the gift and let them know the deal

[Thes One]
I shoot the gift like NRA members on Christmas
Morning warning rock MCs like isthmus like a principal

[Hook]
I'm the principal, our crew's invincible
Under The Stairs
Impairs auditroy of your whole municipal (municipal?)
Code area, attack like malaria
Concrete jungle bundle of joy
With bobby-boys
It's scary to think our tape destroys your crew's hopes (what?)
I can't cope with that, say no
Put it on a DAT, Double K
'Cause everything I say will one day give away
Or another recovered in it's original place
Signify this straight caligrified verse
Petrified rock, put your goddamn block in a herse

[Thes One]
Only thing worse, chaos bursts the eardrums, the P
Making the beats and rhymes funkally-dunkally
Fat like chunky here, but not out for radio play
Here's a crew washing the wax my mind space
Tight A, not Navy deals, no way
Pets for three sixty five days
I add a fourth 'cause I leap year
I leave tracks like Amtrack
Battles the P and Superman
After that your crew will try and forget like Izoin(?)
It's the Amistad, man Beckets(?) know it better
I rip it all up like a letter for the principal

[Hook]

[Thes One]
Chaos bursts...(Double K cuts in)

[Double K]
(Unintelligible) my crew bad as milk
That's one, lace the track
Like a blow with the weak smell
Nigga, your stunned
Other from the brothers with another monkey(?) shit
Put the viddy(?) on the stick and make sure it don't skip
Hip-Hoppin is reallest, punk
You know you want to admit it
All these crews runnin around with fat tracks
They don't get it, the gettin distressed (word?)
The gettin me mad

[Thes One]
So what you sayin, Double K?

[Double K]
Just put that shit on my tab
Don't feel like dealin' with it now
I'll deal with it later
See, the mic's in my possession
Yo, so while she did it
To the minmute
Stupid frontin' since we first stepped in
Brought it back a couple of times
Now you give it a grin
First you tell your homey,
""Yeah man, that shit's fresh!""
Didn't know this kinda shit could be lurkin' the west
We puttin' hair on your chest
We flow with no hesitation
Late radio stations ain't allowed on these premesis
Millions hearin' this
Late at night like domestic violece
Smackin' you the fuck up
Until we get some silence (word)
Keep you like Judge Judy on the mic
Puttin' up a fight
Rollin' hard 'till the break of daylight
So next time you corny niggas want to come hardcore
Go listen to 'Lil Kim (word...)

People Under the Stairs,"[Thes One:]
Yo, I think this time I've found a shorty for me
We talk a lot, take walks a lot, she doesn't bore me
In fact she won't ignore me when I'm speakin music matters
She's intelligent, fly style flatters
My own style, chickens scatter when she floats through the club
Child matters,
Love, I'm thinkin,
I met her one night drinkin, I suggested a show,
She walked up and said, ""I know you
You're from the P-U, T-S, I think your name is Thes too,""
Would you like a soda, I'm underage
Slipped her my number, tipped away
And said give me a page later
In typical Latin lady flavor she said ""Maybe,
Que si"" That's how it should be
And see she played me close, next night dinner,
The champagne toast, sunset pacific coast,
And most while, everything to me was like tight groovy
Always a treat, man, she took me to the movies
Made love to beats, woke up and made me pancakes
And this point I knew my shit was land or lakes
Fellas, I might be in love but something's still not right,
We didn't fight but she didn't call me last night
She got mad loot, no jobs, and plus a high renter
Cellular phone to check the Pac Bell message center,
Which she does too much, and I'm really not with it
She tells me that she loves me so I guess I'm committed

[Chorus: x 2]
Turndown days...
No way, no way
""It gets better, this girl's kinda clever""

[Double K:]
Yo I was coolin' at the club about ten on the dot
Drinkin' Hennessey and Coke, feeling like 2Pac
Me and the crew hit the stage in about a half of one
Trying to ditch security 'cause I'm under twenty-one
Just then, I see this fine Latin chick walk past
Face like never before, body like an hour glass
So I was lookin' at the booty, it was lookin' right back,
You would have thought she wanted loot but it wasn't like that
Yo this girl stepped to me, asked me, what was my name,
I told her, Mike, she looked with a grin, said, that's right
Then for a minute I started to wonder how she knew who I was,
Yo, we've been doin' mad shows with the underground buzz,
Then I asked her her name, yo I heard that somewhere,
Matter of fact, I have, but yo the K didn't care
All I wanted was the ass, only that and nothing more,
Talked a cool 15 minutes, got the number, hit the floor,
Saw Thes, gave him the DAT, we rocked the show,
Woke up the next day, aww shit, here we go
Seen a number in the pager that I didn't recognize,
Matched it up with the little paper received last night,
Word up, I'm 'bout to hit the skins like it was my first
Returned the call, got the address, and quenched my thirst,
Took a quick shower, was out in five minutes,
Big grin on my grill 'cause I knew I'd be up in it,
Her crib was in four, so I strolled down the road,
Kinda high off the blunt, bangin' on the front door,
She opened up, still in her nightclothes,
Foreplay was in effect before I closed the front door,
You know how it goes, fingers in her shoobie doobie,
Whispered in her ear that I wanted her to do me,
And we did it homeboy, all day and night,
But even after that, something still wasn't right,
What the fuck, Thes's beat tape doin' on your night stand?
Yo, I figured it out, it was a game-plan
I asked her what's up, she said I got a man,
And I got a what, what, what, what

[Chorus: x 2]

[Assault:]
Y'all didn't see me all day, I stayed at the bay awaitin',
The car from the maiden I had met when I was chasin'
Down the bus which I missed but I wasn't too pissed
When I spotted a sis, who lit my eyes like the trees
They put up on Christmas, I said, hey, how are you doin' today?
She said, aiight, the frame was tight so I continued her way,
Shootin' the breeze like LA, conversation was cool,
She went to school, had a job, and no meat was the rule,
Now not to send like a gay librarian,
I appreciate the fact you're vegetarian,
I eat some flesh once in awhile, was her reply,
And then she looked at me with an old look in her eye,
I said, what, I'm not your kind of nigga?
Not quite, but I'll be very interested to hang out with you tonight,
I thought whoa, huh, this girl's a sick puppy,
If she chills at the crib I'll probably get lucky
But she never showed... All day, I missed work...
But she never showed up...
I think she was bisexual
She had a fat ass...
It was like red, kinda like reddish brown

Some people call it the chronic
I call it the best stress reliever, the mind pleaser

Dude, hold up
We'll talk about it right after I'm done getting bouted
Stay clouded with my local reefer merchant so my purchase will be fat
Not skinny, yeah I smoke plenty
And it ain't to look pretty, I bring j's up this stone city
Floating round my town, cracking jokes, eating food
Acting the fucking clown and all my friends are down
To chip in, and hit a few, I mean ?? a few

Lets have a mid city fiesta with your west LA connections
Hop inside the vehicle start crossing intersections
We learning life's lessons
While we blaze this herbal essence
A man was still a child and I have so many questions
A struggle on my life till we vade the misconceptions
To find a place to live between the negatives and positives
While trying to make money slanging synonyms and homonyms
I went to pops house so I can visit moms and him
Cut to the mall got them brand new pair of Timberlands
Then dipped down a one way trying to skew up double k
And chill with my people on this bright and sunny day
My nigga spliff was sippin' Beck's I'm slappin' hands with guests
Ok the shady spot so we can circulate the stress
Mary Jane invades my brain now I can't complain
I'm sayin' what else is there to do besides relax
Let the problems in your mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got you trippin' you watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants
As the words become a sentence you start to feelin' different
The stress is out your mind you feel like the weight was lifted
Terrific I'm glad we had this time to discuss
I'm outro call me if you want to blaze one up

Make sure the families in place and let the music unwind

Ride around the country chillin' in my LA Express
On every street corner

If he bottle spill tobacco don't nobody carry guns
We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin'
On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin'
Under the blue sky the state laced the small
Belucchi quarter inched cables with all the sound that we brawl
Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one
Feel like a dad at a ball game mappin' with his son
Chuck D yo word up we buggin' over time
From the light to the lime original star time
It's the double crisis one
It camel brought the ammo so we can shoot
Game like thugs on your sport channel
Take off the do-rag replace it with a thinkin cap
If you didn't know tell the bro he should have known that

Bullshittin' while we sittin' down drinkin' our Sabu

Funky tracks and nickle sacks freestylin' all night
Doin' it right no one with time music make it better

Snub no's to the hoes who pose I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows
And I'm leavin' you so by the time I get the phoenix
Underground ground hits are goin' to fiend this musical genius

Armed with overlooked talented guests of while bless crooks
Who still lose and keep this shit alive
Something for your truths to sit around and bye bye
For camel double invest to ease stress
We bout to hip hop so have fun and god bless

And it's a family affair
And you can bring your sister she can clip my hair
If she ain't there well then I'm s*** outa luck
I'm in the house with mickey mouse and donald duck

Trying to catch my truck
It's me and double chillin up in the cut

And if you ask me twice
I'm going to tell you the same
It's rap basketball and doctor j is the name

And you can see my picture chillin up in the gold frame
Type that y'all
And you just don't stop

We up jump the boogie like scooby-doo
Smoke a doobie or two

I keep the green trees
So my car smells fresh
Take a bath with diamonds
I only bought the best
Keep my ladies well dressed

I got rhymes from detroit straight to outaspace

Party down with my friends some skinny some fat

People Under the Stairs,"[Double K arguing with woman]
What you mean I ain't making no money off this hip-hop shit?
Yeah, I know this is all I do is stay up and make beats
You know, this is how we make our living
This is what the people want us to do
Nah, I'm not gonna get a job there
I'm not gonna work there, all day at The Gap
Fuck it, hey, come over here, let's listen to Thes One

[Thes One]
Check it out, it was me and Double K in my room in 95
Beatboxing on the mic, recording the tape live
Before we arrived on the scene, you know what I mean
When it was all about... I forgot, man forget it
See now the P is sweated as a global event
But it seems those closest to me seem the least to care
When it was ""Rah-rah, y'all can do it"" back in the day
Now it's like 3 hours deep and ""When are you getting paid?""
My records are played, I sleep smiling every night
But when I wake up, it's something else, a whole new fight
Like cats double crossing me, that I try and help out
If it wasn't for me and Double that shit wouldn't come out
So recognize whose the guys devoting they life to it
Sacrificed stability to flex our ability
Prove the inner artillery
I can't chill until we fufill the plan of having mic's in the hand
The sole reason I was cast down on this land
Is to sit in front of the MPC and turn the bland into the flambay
Things to play to make your day
Same shit 10 years ago I'm doing today
And 10 years from now, so don't ask how or even why
be	-boy for life, fuck a suit and a tie
'cause I'll know I made a difference on the day that I die
Aiyyo, I be	-boy for life so fuck a suit and a tie

[Double K]
Yeah... I feel you man
She be talking that ole bullshit, you know
You know, maybe you should get out and go get a job, ya know
Or--or, we can't spend enough time, ya know what I'm saying?
Just like you, maan, Big Thes man, 
I done spent all my life tryna do this hip-hop shit
Think it was like 95-96, when I...

Perfected my track skills on the SP
Murdered 10 seconds in a minute, peers couldn't get it
Mike was walking on water, my brother you shoulda seen it
Got ate up in some rap battles, I'm here to redeem it
Like a rain check hustler, scoping the aisles
Chocking lyrics making beats just to keep it on file
With the ADAT Zip on the floppy I'm never coming sloppy
No reason to copy niggas, I'm dope so go figure
Not conceided nigga, I'm confident when I'm dropping it
Hold the microphone firm, let the lyrics burn
Like the buddha to the sherm
I'm mellow with one word, two, let it cage, 
Bringing better days when I bust
Stay grounded with my head in the clouds and that's a must
Ya know, just a piece in my hip-hop black book
Outlining the track y'all watch for the hook
Filling in my ideas, here to keep your style shook
Never rapping like niggas just to be in the game
I'm coming from the inside so y'all remember my name
Yo, it's the K Dub, trouble bringing, the notorious one
Couldn't be stopped, keeping these sucka crews on the run, ya dig it?
No matter what y'all say, do or know, it's me and Thes One maintaining the... uhh...

Ya know how it goes, man... it's me and Thes One, like always, it's two of us... 
Keepin' it live... keepin' it fresh... I dunno man...
Sometimes I just feel like we can't take it no more
like we just gonna bust back ya know battle rapping, backpacking
Yeah... yeah... we backrapping... 
Backrapping and slapping all you fools in the face
You just a... you just a... 
Just a disgrace to the... to the.. to the.. yeah

Don't even come from the city and your runnin your lips

Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow

Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillen with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live

Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools

Creep up the hipe
Wrestlee moovahs the sleepers

T tops, jerry curls, jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for 
World on Wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The Color soundtrack rock the Fatburger jukebox
My L.A. U.S.C. memories are every sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at Charro's and La Barca, not Taco Bell
And if your not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin our labels something to say and something to prove and
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowds groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks strap New York rap on the block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pedro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin Busy Bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility Catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads

We trying to get enough, we gotta fill up
Before it's all gone the song remains on
Until the beat stops

Never mind, no need to remind
You know who we be, yo it's the capital G's
Putting the P's in hip hop
Saying, hi to the ho's who wear hardly any clothes

He is looking at you
Watching you, watching me, the incredible MC
Chicks call me Mikey
(Why's that?)

'Cause I like they stare when I'm digging it
And know they wanna try they like the way I rap
They like the way I chill
Couple hours in a conversation, show 'em how I thrill

I'm a one minute man, I lick it then split it
Empty it out, fill it in like the blank and I'm out
Big Mike, that's right, give 'em something they can feel
Yo, I'm the top-ranked chief on the wheels of steel

I walk the streets of LA and feel comfortable
Me and the homie make music
And they come in with bull so next time
You got a rhyme that's blazing hot, throw it away
People Under to save the day

Sometimes it ain't timed, sometimes it can't be
This time we kick back and letcha conscious be free
The music is playing loud and we never haveta leave
We never gotta leave
(We never gotta leave)

Beautiful brown skin lady, ya move something
Montego bay style, smile from the Caribbean isle
No fronting while we pumping the beat
Audiophiles that jump in like I light up the seat

With the complete file scooters and 45s the palm trees
Red stripe nights the calm breeze
The type to relax ease back to conceive wax
And contact the origin of habitat
Two cats making fat, it's like that

With a rap similar to a pitti pat of a cat
Walking the roof to make it back to the truth
I dig crates for the late great existence of black plates
To booming the eighths on the floor

Thinking you want more
Leaving my mark like a doc mart on a wood floor
It's good for the soul like dinner witcha moms
People under the stairs the duo who drop bombs
Snares laid back like armchairs

Hit the beach I'm outta reach
So play my CD and let it teach the recipe
Half beatrocka, half tivity [unverified]
Walk a fresh breath control like Binaca

Sometimes it ain't timed, sometimes it can't be
This time we kick back and letcha conscious be free
The music is playing loud and we never haveta leave
We never gotta leave

Now envision a mathematician giving up a calculator
Ayo that's me without the funk, Double K rock the cross fader

Yo we got the whole world under surgery for funk transplants
Making music not hood so yo we don't got the look
We got bad memory, a gang of records and fans
Mad plans to keep it live with just the blink of an eye
Yeah we thought that you thought that we wasn't coming back
We turned around and smacked that clown
(Who told you that?)
We too cool for our britches, putting stitches on your zip disc
Get this, hip hop is the drug and we in rehab
Just be glad, that you don't live close to us
Then you see most of us
And we be known to bust

To up-step stage, sound check, and wreck shows
With the nice confidence, critically precise
Reassuring my brother, rolling the dice, making life ice
Locked on new blocks, promoters, and cities
Alone on the road, temp well-below fifty
What a pity, it comes down to mics and a pillow
Couple handshakes, hash browns and a hello
From a fan to make it worthwhile with the plan
To cover more miles than any man should have
In limited time, with unlimited rhymes to give for b-boys
Unified in towns where they live, worldwide
And at the same time, it’s still cold
Thousand miles away with your life on hold
At home in other times zones, doing our best
Travelling train-to-plane, stretching out, getting rest
In uncomfortable positions, a show rocking missions
Looking for an audience or crowd that’ll listen
And it happens, put my worthwhile in my rap
And a paycheck in the form of loud handclapping

And go back to the hotel (same thing)

When I point, it’s the joint, y’all, I’m having a ball
Travelling without the battling of who’s weak and who’s raw
Just in the state of mind of partying and ripping rhymes
Smoking out the green room, cracking jokes, drinking wine
But sometimes, I unwind and find myself sober
And called home in about a week, technically it’s overseas
Where I’mma find myself at the bottom of this
Chain smoking anything, hollering at Chris
He say he going through it too, asking what we gotta do
I said we got an interview at a half past two
With all feelings aside, a soundcheck at five o’clock
We up, set to rock another night outta thirty of them
Keep the greens coming (two kinds!), and I can recline
Over to the next state line and dealing with time
An all-star rap show, proving the thought
Keeping it moving, country-to-country-to-state, we heavy grooving
But you see, I got obligations at home
My mind telling me someone’s having relations at home
All I can do is stay high and focus on the P
But it’s that angel and that devil, and he’s sitting, fucking with me
I’m L.A.-International-bound, pack up the sound, head West
I got smooth intentions on breaking necks
But first, I’m heading to the bank with a big grin
It’s a couple that know I’m coming back to do it again (ah, ha ha!)
And I’m talking ‘bout you, you, you… oh, but not you

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who standing looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Reflections,2006

And big nuts is what it takes
To get up on the mic and enunciate,
Or else your fate
Is disappointment.
But give yourself a break;
Don't get disjointed from the point
That you was tryin' to make.
Ya know
We destined to be fresh;
It ain't no secret.
'Cause these bitches runnin' they mouths;
I guess that's 'cause they detest us.
But just rock at them souls of mischief shows.
That ninety-four flow
Leavin' 'em froze,
With an infinitesimal amount of aggression for MC's.
But still digestible
For the rest of you;
To ease up on it
If ya want to get with it.
Ain't no opponents
'Cause we pack with components to kill.
React if you feel
You haven't been snared and trapped.
In the ninety-two, that nigga, Cas, made y'all scared to rap.
The High-rollas.
Take it as you may.
I never perpetrated to this day,
Or did anything that they did.
Only catered to the way
That we created and dated.
To let 'em know
We kickin' that straight shit;
That sacred,
Dope rhyme related.
Every time they congregated, it was us;
Definitely somethin' to discuss,
Yeah.
[Chorus]",Yeah It Was You,1995
Pep Love,"[Chorus: x 2]
I'm gonna tell 'em that I'm not here
Ain't taking no calls today
Time to refresh and do it all my way
Get off my back
Not taking orders
It's time to refresh, make tracks and sing

[The Grouch]
Bring about that piece of mind and recline
Let your guard down and see what you find
Inhale and exhale deeply, get loose
Stretch out your muscles and squeeze you some juice

Light that incense up and then bless your space
Go to that place where the calm is on your face
I promise that a taste of this is pure bliss
Where thought grows freely and minutes mean shit

I'm up in it clean fit, dreamin' so vivid
I let it all radiate, you see how I'm livin'
Energized and rested, tested time after time
I'm impressed with my body and mind

My hobby's so strenuous I gotta cool out
Focus on health so that I'm not ruled out
Exercise my knowledge and abolish all stress
Get a good sleep and tomorrow I press

Today I'm...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Bicasso]
Now let's pretend that I was just born
A niggas first breath, heartbeat, a life with no scorn
It wasn't me, it was the egos of MCs they say
The mic tempt me too

But like the dollars makes 'em fishy dude ok
The average day I got the duties of a lifeguard for myself
When I'm swimmin' in a system makes it so hard
But at the rest I just post up fine,

Patrol my coastline and make the most of my mind
Create the envelope and push it to the people on the avenue
The ones stuck in they offices, this world is a vacuum
But my sauce it got some smack too

Like on a Sunday afternoon I got you tuned into the spiciness
Blended just right with this in the pocket like some jeans
Or the rhythm of these funk strings and I might just get
Another dosage of this slow shit

It's bumpin in my system and my soul too,
It's what I do when I'm alone, it's like some soul food
I wouldn't just get up from the table man, it's too smooth
This groove is better than any wrong thing

And if the phone rings I'm'a hit 'em back now
Let the song sing...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Pep Love]
I'm unavailable for comment
I'd rather go sail my boat and ride the tail of a
Comet, inhale of the chronic, a glass of orange juice,
Read a book, write a poem,

Hike a trail in the forest dude!
Breathe in fresh air
Release pressure
Extend and bend and strength yeah!

Burn a incense, silence my mind in a instant
Because now is the time and I'm in this
It gets me open like Halls Mentholyptus
Pine cones and eucalyptus leaves

Mushrooms and wild flowers bloom
And cool Cali breeze
Make me feel superhuman
I might fly a kite, go home rock the mic

Throw on a song I like, call up my girl to bone
I'm in my own world, a zone
And it be them days like this when I don't answer the phone
I'm clearing my space

Excuse me while I take this brief intermission
From out the rat race
No hustle and bustle though my muscles are strong
I just don't want to do nothing

But sing my song...

[Chorus: x 2]",Not Here,2000

Me...
Maybe...

Well, I was wondering
If you'd fly away with me
We'd go to a promised land
Some place, sometime to breath

Put a little trust in me
We've got what each other needs
So, baby, just believe...

You and I, I
You and me, we
Could come together and set this world free, please
Believe in this dream we gon' weave
'Cause we believe in this thievin'
This heavin', this eve of destruction behind us
Let this love intertwine us and find us
Out of this bind plus
Peace, your highness
Ease your mind
It's time to just chill, and just build, and just unwind

[Chorus x 2]
Ease you mind, come chill with me
No more work, just for a week
It's goin' good
Now, we can see
We were meant to be

When I first looked at you
I knew there was something real
You're different from other men
Wanna give
To you what you've given me
There's no need to question these
Intentions that I have

It's the little, subtle things
Excuses to make you smile
Come over just for a while
Don' wanna hold back anymore

The potential for this stretch is long
We on a higher echelon
And extra strong
When we're together, there's no pressure, just a song, and
You inspire me
I empower you

I heard a choir of angels calling out my name 
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again 
I turned my face towards the barren sun 

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground 
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away

and takes ya on adventures to dimensions I can't
even begin to explain
I tantalize your senses with sentences
since it's senseless to attempt this
my plan to rise is endless
i'm generally known to be off the hinges
with a microphone with me
ya want to fight? come on hit me,
I ain't gon stop beating that ass until the cops come get me
refuse verbal abuse to cook your goose
I serve superb turbulence, when I get loose
the beat get battered and bruised you nerds get hit
from every direction after the herb gets lit
who want to come? can test me now let's get down
(get on up) and get the mess beat outta you pesky clown ass
pathetic competitors won't last around
after I blast a round, at ya casket
cats get disfigured and eat a fist
fuckin with this nigga when I'm pissed
and even when I'm feelin bliss
it'll be an unworthy risk
to disturb me 'cause I'm impervious to the words you speak
I split nucleus's when I shoot the gift
it's ridiculous to dispute me if
you don't want to shoot me, just watch me do my duty
my rap slaps your ear like sticks, pucks and hockey
I don't give a big fuck at all
about all your jewelry and tomfoolery
you can get the balls
if you don't want to be cool with me we can brawl
we do it every weekend y'all, at the fight club

pump ya fist and resist the system
I insist the gist of this consist of wisdom
catechism??
we can have a collision and go at it to add to the mission
poetical fisticuffs, I spit to crush the shit you bust
you don't want to get in the pit with us
we gladiators of the third eye variety
you can be mad and hate us, or ride with me
I flow, toe to toe blow for blow
the collective objective, is to overthrow
we soldiers here to let the poor folks know
imperialists get the fist and the po-po get the dick
the serioiusness of this gets me furious
when I hear ignorance spit by my peers
I guess that's why I'm here
to change up this strange stuff in the coming years
my plan's to put hands on my people in the trance
so they can understand what really makes a man strong
convictions, with no restrictions I inflict them
to the beat of a kick drum
you want some? step up and get some
scuff knees and elbows when P-L flows
to speak to y'all or we can brawl
we do it every weekend y'all, at the fight club!

comme pousse ici la haine

Et des doutes par cent

Ese dolor tan grande
Lo llevo muy profundo puesme ha dejado 
Solo en el mudo 
Ya ni llorar es bueno 
Cuando no hay esperanza

Por mÃ¡s que se busque, Por mÃ¡s que se esconda
Tu duermes conmigo, Toditas las noches
Te quedas callada, Sin ningun reproche

Por eso te quiero, por eso te adoro
Eres en mi vida, todo mi tesoro

A veces regreso, borracho de angustia
Te lleno de besos why caricias mustias
Pero estas dormida, no sientes caricias
Te abrazo a mi pecho, me duermo contigo

Mas luego despierto, tu no estÃ¡s conmigo
Solo estÃ¡ mi almohada

A veces te miro, callada why ausente
why sufro en silencio, como tanta gente
Quisiera gritarte, que vuelvas conmigo
Que si aÃºn estoy vivo, sÃ³lo es para amarte

Pero todo pasa why a los sufrimientos
como las palabras, se las lleva el viento

Por eso regreso, borracho de angustia
Te lleno de besos why caricias mustias
Pero estas dormida...",Almohada,1998

Donde estés, con quien estés

Entre lágrimas y risas

Y no podrás

Con quién estés
Aunque le demuestres lo contrario
Y le ames a diario me recordarás

Donde estés
Si alguien te pregunta por el pasado
Negarás que tu me has dado
Algo de ti con quien estés

Si nos vemos algún día
Evitarás la mirada mía
Y buscarás la de él

Jamás me cansaré
De amanecer pensando en ti
Esperando oír estas palabras
Amor mío, he decidido volver

Donde estés
Entre lágrimas y risas

Del tren se escucha el silbato
Se acerca mi porvenir

Cuando llegó a la estación
Un tren ya estaba silbando
Y un carro de dinamita
Ya se estaba quemando

Jesús, vámonos apeando
Mira que el carro de atrás
Ya se nos viene quemando

Yo pienso muy diferente
Yo no quiero ser la causa
De que muera tanta gente

Porque era de cuesta arriba
Y antes de llegar al seis
Allí terminó su vida

Tú te has ganado las palmas

Pepe Aguilar,"Si ves una flor marchitada en el suelo
Es mi corazón que se muere de celos
Aquel gorrión que suspira en el árbol
Es mi alma que llora si no le haces caso

Si ves por el cielo una blanca paloma
Es mi vida y mi voz
Que te van a decir cuanto te quiero

Esta triste guitarra que suena y suena
Sola en la noche es mi voz que te dice
No me abandones, no me abandones

Esta triste guitarra que llora y llora
Mientras tu duermes es mi alma
Que quiere volver a verte volver a verte

Si un día la lluvia acaricia tu pelo
No es agua mi amor son tan solo mis besos
Si el sol en la calle calienta tu cara
Son rayos de amor que me salen del alma

Si el aire una tarde alborota tu pelo
No es el viento soy yo que
Quisiera vivir en tu pensamiento

Esta triste guitarra que suena y suena
Sola en la noche es mi voz que te dice
¡No me abandones, no me abandones!

Esta triste guitarra que llora y llora
Mientras tu duermes
Es mi alma que quiere volver a verte
Volver a verte

Se que fui muy claro que no iba a volver
Pero estoy cansado de estar asustado
Solo con pensar en no volverte haber
Mírame un momento tienes que entender

Tengo que decir que estoy muy lastimado
Que no sera fácil volver a empezar
Pero siempre he estado tan enamorado
Que si aun me amas quiero regresar
Este tiempo solo me ayuda a pensar

Que no importa lo que hiciste ayer
Si te has equivocado estado tan ciego que no te he escuchando
Pero creo que ahora puedo continuar
Que no entiendo mi vida sin ti te perdono y olvido
Que quiero intentarlo si aun no te he perdido
Que tantos momentos que quiero salvar

Se que dije cosas porque estaba herido
Y que haberme ido no fue lo mejor
Puede ser muy cruel cuando estas confundido
Cuando te ha cegado un golpe de valor
Hoy se que vivir contigo es lo mejor

Que deje un momento de adorarte
Mi amor no se extingue fácilmente
No quiero de mi mente separarte

Te amare vida mía eternamente
Seré un esclavo para adorarte
Y en vez de maldecirte solamente
Te adoro y te idolatro ciegamente

Si vagas por el mundo sola y triste
Acuérdate de mí por un momento
Nunca olvides que en el mundo, existe un hombre
Que te ama y te idolatra ciegamente

No quiero de mi mente separarte

Y vaya que me hacia falta
Para sacarla de mi

Y aunque me sangre la herida
A golpe de llanto
Tendrá que salir

Mi sueños en desvelada
Atados a esta fría calma
No me dejan dormir

Pero contra todo
Tendré que vivir

Negociare con la pena
Para que no me pegue tanto
Y así poder resistir

Inventare una ventana
Con un solo motivo
De mandarla al olvido
Para que no me pegue tanto

Para que no me duela tanto

Que todo todo lo aprendí de ti
Y yo se que nunca, fui tan bueno como lo prometí

And I ain't making it easy

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!
Este nivel solamente es alcanzado por aquellas súper-estrellas!
Lo único que, ahora, junto a Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Estas son ""Las Gárgolas: The Next Generation""!
Prra!

Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Ahí les dejo al mío!
Mario!
Comételos vivo!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24

Estos cabrones quieren que los dejemos feos
No bromeo y no les tengo miedo a los feos
Soy guerrillero y en la calle como les campeo
Mucha cazaera, mujeres y fumeteo
Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

(¡Es el turno del gorila!)
Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal

De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

Waiting for me Mary, no, Mary Tyler Moore

I know you can't feel it 'cause you feel no the pain

It feels good, that's understood, but don't forget

No love for pepper posse and I'll make that bet
That you ain't got no style, ain't got no reggae
And there are words that I just don't say
Take a pick, you've got a selection
But if you want some of this protection

Oh, na, na, na
Feels good, when it should
Sit back it takes a while

Listen, there are stories tales and lies
Some attract rumors, some attract lies
Got this coffee, so bring me your cup
One more pot so we can stay up

While my backs against the wall
Take a ride, competition take a ride
Pull it operator watch the other side

As they dance into the sun

Some big up new style holding trophy cups
Rory select while these speakers erupt
Sound sweeter in an echo chamber
Don't you know they are the danger
Three bottles of Cristal and it's agreed
The best could only come from the Don Wesley
Close my eyes while I take a ride

Turn on my TV, Bad news her to greet me,
They got a new list of warnings. 

It's a slow day I prefer,
And sitting under perfect weather,
But, I'm traveling through,
God knows I'll skip the preview,
And waiting is time wasted forever 

And I've got to keep moving on, leaving this border town,
Don't know where, but it won't be here, I won't be around. 

I'm tired of this scene
It's just the same different name routine,
While I'm still able, throw my cards on your table,
To show you there's no in between. 

And I've got to keep moving on, leaving this border town,
Don't know where, but it won't be here, I won't be around. 

I'm growing older in the repetition,
Not knowing everything that I'm missing,
I really have to go, I really need to know.

Don't know where, but it won't be here, I won't be around.

Pepper,"Look what I found in kona town
While the sky gets weary and the sun goes down
Its summer living, ooh its the season
To get your body naked and then start screaming
Around the clock 'cause we dont stop
Ya 'gotta keep it moving like a porno plot
All the drinks fix ya, its a perfect mixture
You lean to the side to get a clearer picture

I know yes I know. that I have played the fool
I know yes I know. im so lonely because of you

Here come the night, dont forget to invite
All those girls with a horny appetite
Now, get riskey on a holiday
Whats the sense of working hard if you never get to play?
So, give a luck with no politics
Turn yourself into an ""x"" rated lunatic
I like is daring; I keep staring
Got my eyes focused on the skirt shes wearing

I know 
Yes I know. that I have played the fool
I know 
Yes I know. im so lonely because of you, are you?

Heated evening starts to escalate
Rolling on and on till we evaporate
And I've been missing, ooh I've been missing
The way your body moves in those late night posotions
I hit repeat on arena beats
Make my way through the crowd in the summer heat
The house is shaking, furniture is breaking
Wake up in the morning with my body aching

Yes I know that I have played the fool
I know
Yes I know, that im so lonely because of you

Her dress is worn perfectly
A speaker shuffle her dancing feet
My tongue trips me up when I speak

Now she's the type of girl that could only be trouble
Looking the part, right the start she hands me a green bottle
She asks me for the time, I reply 'No thanks, I'm fine'
Then she laughs and asks what I was thinking of

I want a part of your crazy love
It's really all I'm ever thinking of
I need a part of your crazy love
It's a crazy love, it's a crazy love

Not so hard to persuade
She gives a smile, puts it away
And that's enough for me to
Do what you want to do

Soft spoken hanging through the morning
Really don't pay attention to the breakfast she's burning
The food is on my plate, I lie and say 'It's great'
Then she smiles and asks what I was dreaming of

I want a part of your crazy love
It's really all I'm ever thinking of
I need a part of your crazy love
It's a crazy love, it's your crazy love

I'll finish the dishes put on some records if you know how

In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin',1999
Pepper Adams,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1999
Pepper Adams,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1999
Pepper Adams,"My gal and I, we had a fight 
And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
