"Al Jackson, Jr.","Send me some lovin'
Send it, I pray
How can I keep loving you
Only when you're so far, far away?

Ooh, send me your kisses
Why don't you send it, my dear
So I can hold you
And pretend, yeah, you are here

Why don't you send me your kisses?
Honey, I can feel that great love
I need you so bad
I miss you, you so much

Al Jacobs,"Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you
 
Hurt to think that you lied to me

Al Jardine,"Well I guess you had to be there
Such a different place
And I was cruisin' along
Never thinkin' that we'd ever change
Yeah I guess you had to be there
It was a hell of a ride
Lines were blurry and hurried
But it felt like the stars had aligned

We were sharin' a new day
Singing a new song
And everyone's problems
Were suddenly gone
Everything I ever wanted
Is right before my face
Tell all the beautiful people
Were always at my place

Well I guess you had to be there
All we wanted was more
There were winners and losers
And people passed out on my floor
And you know you should've called me
For that real good time
Guess you missed some of the gold
When you're too busy chasin' the shine

We were sharin' a new day
Singing a new song
And everyone's problems
Were suddenly gone
Everything I ever wanted
Is right before my face
'Cause all the beautiful people
Were always at my place

We were sharing a new day
Sipping on a new wine
And everyone's problems
Were suddenly mine
And all you ever wanted
Was right in front of your face
Starts as a good thing
Turns into a hate",Guess You Had to Be There,2015
Al Jardine,"Bet you wish it really didn't matter
All along you never really had her
She's your everything
Keeps you wondering

Doesn't matter where we are
Doesn't matter where we've been
I can't believe it's gone this far
I can't believe what's happening

Tell me why, down deep inside
Girl, you gotta know
That there's a part of you and me
That I just can't let go

Fly away (Fly away)
Nothing, but nothing
Could ever stand in our way

A special love can't be found anywhere in the world
Except for here, that's where you are
What I'm thinking of can't be found anywhere in the world
Except for here, that's where you are

If you knew that you would fall when you first met her
Now she's gone and you just can't forget her
How'd your everything leave you wondering

Fly away (Fly away)
Nothing, but nothing
Can stand in our way

A special love can't be found anywhere in the world
Except for here, that's where you are
What I'm thinking of can't be found anywhere in the world
Except for here, that's where you are

Bet you wish it really didn't matter
All along you never really had her
She's your everything
Makes you wanna sing",Our Special Love,2015
Al Jardine,"So many years ago but I remember
A distant sunset on the open sea
Fascinated by the sailing ships
On a crimson shore that seemed to call out to me

I still can feel the hope that fills my heart
I still can taste the ocean breeze (Sail away)

As I sail away to the farthest reaches
Follow the sun to the white sand beaches
I only know what the west wind teaches
Won't you sail away with me?

(Sail away) Made a wish upon a falling star
(Sail away) Never thought that we would get this far (Sail away)
I won't be lonely you can be my only
Won't you sail away with me?

For a while I almost gave up dreaming
But still this image stayed alive in my soul
While I was working trying to make a living
My so-called life was spinning out of control

Summer wind was blowing through my head
The endless current of my dreams (Sail away)

As I sail away to the farthest reaches
Follow the sun to the white sand beaches
I only know what the west wind teaches
Won't you sail away with me? (Sail away)

Sail away to a land without time
Drink my water from a shell that I find
I won't be lonely you can be my only
Won't you sail away with me?

Oh, let me take you there to another land
Don't expect the world to understand (Sail away)

We can sail away while we still have time
There's a million places that I have in mind
As we cast our fate to the open sea
Sail away with me

(Sail away) Made a wish upon a falling star
Never thought that we would get this far
Try and imagine how our life would be
If you could sail away with me

Sail away
Sail away",Sail Away,2015
Al Jardine,"Kinda funny but mostly sad
Kinda good but mostly bad
I really miss that thing we had
Until you went away

I think about the night we met
There's just some things you don't forget
I haven't heard from you again
Since you went away

But now you're gone and I've gotta get on with my life

How many times do I have to explain?
How many nights 'til I see you again?
How many times can I sit here alone?
Is there a chance that you will ever come home?
Tell me why

I think about that ocean view
And all the dreams I shared with you
I guess they won't be coming true
At least for you and me

But now you're gone and I've gotta get on with my life

How many times do I have to explain?
How many nights 'til I see you again?
How many times can I sit here alone?
Is there a chance that you will ever come home?

Tell me why",Tell Me Why,2015
Al Jardine,"As the time goes by
And I wonder why
When I know the day is through

The summer wine
My favorite time
The night that I met you

Somewhere in between
These things I've seen
I have somehow lost my way

The starry nights
The harbor lights
The moon across the bay

What ever happened to my favorite places
Nothing's where it used to be
What ever happened
What's gonna happen to me

When I wake up in the morning
If I see that you're not there

If you're away I'll be OK
I know that you still care

What ever happened to my favorite places
Nothing's where it used to be
What ever happened
What's gonna happen to me

What ever happened to yesterday morning
My dream came true

These memories
The summer breeze
That brings me back to you",Whatever Happened,2015
Al Jardine,"Whatever happened to me and you
And everything we've been going through
So many pieces but never in a very straight line

Right could it be the right
Could it be the right time
For getting together
Right could it be the right
Could it be the right time
I'm thinking forever

So many times we get fooled again
With everything that's been happening
Like changing places with someone
In the back of the line
But not this time

Right could it be the right
Could it be the right time
For thinking it over
Right could it be the right
Could it be the right time
For getting to know her

Right time
Could it be the right time
Right time
Could it be the right time
Right time

Right could it be the right

Al Jarreau,"Just beside the door
The bold and certain hand
That turned the dragons trembled
He touched the Holy Lamp
And faintly saw his feet

And just beside the door,
His pure uncertain tears
The burden fell so tender
And in the darkest night a
Rose grew by his feet

Stand beside me now,
I've been in your place
And you've been in mine
And the only difference
Is our space and time
And the only light is
Somehow in the lamp
That's at your feet
Why can't you see?

But ain't it high,
Ain't holy when you see?
And it's just times when
I'm weary worries me
Don't you know how Aladdin's
Lamp guards the night

I want to offer them to you.",Alladdin's Lamp,1975
Al Jarreau,"By snowy fields and lanes 
She keeps the waiting
In candlelight the sacred 
Alter shines
He suckled the young lambs 
Upon his knee
Giving the weary sleep in peace
He read the stars inside her dream
But he was blind

Of winter's love for spring, 
She kept the vision
Sweet chariots aflame against the sky
He played on the harp sweet melody
Children and emperors came to see
He drove the dragons into the nights
But he was blind

So lock all the gates and 
Bolt the chamber door
Because nobody leaves or 
Enters anymore
Now lock all the gates and 
Bolt the chamber door
Would you lock all the
Gates and the chamber

Come, come
Somebody come and lock 
All the gates and bolt the chamber
Cause nobody leaves or enters anymore

By snowy fields and lanes she 
Keeps the waiting
In candlelight the sacred alter shines
He suckled the young lambs upon his knee
He bid the weary sleep in peace
He read the stars inside her dream
But he was blind, he was blind",Lock All the Gates,1975
Al Jarreau,"Do you know that it was 
By design
How you told me, told me, 
Told me
That you were free and 
It was by design
How you wiggle, wiggle, 
Start to wiggle
When you're just walking by me
And it was by design
How you offered me just to walk
On down the road
I think that love, 
Love was by design

Raggedy Ann
And it was by design
Sunny fields and mansions just 
Behind your eyes
Lady lace and velvet passion 
Burning just behind your eyes
It was by design how you 
Conquered me
And on a fiery star we rose
I think that love, was your love, 
By design

Would you, could you take me?
Let me fall by the wayside
Take me in your arms

Al Jarreau,"There is a way to make
Sweet feeling last
There is a way to be
Sheltered when the wind is free
There is a way my father
Taught me how to sing
And I sing my song every day now

And it won't take much
Of your time
Really won't take much
Of your time
No, it won't take much
Of your precious time

In your bones
You really got it, talking
About the spirit
You got it, deep in your bones,
You really got it

Mountains cry

Me how to live my life

To a party over yonder
Susan wants to take me 
To her heart
It's a arm and tender place there, 
Do you know
Susan, I've been living here 
In this fortress
And it's filled with armor
And sometimes celebrations 
Lose their charm

Susan do you mind, 
Sometimes I'm restless
Rolling on the floor in pain and woe
After all the precious gifts you
Will gladly give to me, girl
I may blindly lock and bolt the door

Baby, sweet baby
I'll truly love you through my years
Well it's just that sometimes 
By midnight light
I'm frightened by my fears
But if you could just hold me, 
Warm me, girl

And tenderly anoint my eyes
Then I may see the way

Come on, Susan, take the time
Tell me, Susan, do you mind
If I've been blind a long time?
I been blind a long time

Sometimes, see, if you're
Not careful
A little hurt, pain in your heart
Will make you blind
Blind to the real thing, once
It comes along

Can you wait for me, till I 
Get this thing together?

Al Jarreau,"Now it was a hot sticky morning
'Round the Fourth of July
The breeze was standing still
I'm hanging out by myself
And I'm having a good time
With the folk inside my head
And you know, Lord, 
How you did a lovely thing
See, times my head is lighter 
Than it's ever been
And anyone who's ever had 
Sweet potato pie
Don't want pumpkin again, 
No, they don't want

'Cause it don't taste right, no
Look-a-here city boy with your 
Silks and braided hair
Don't you let nobody fool you 
With no imitation nothing
Tell 'em, say, unh, unh, buddy,
I been there
Listen mama, when you
Finally walk on in
Don't forget to bring along 
Your sweet potato tin
'Cause when you serve him 
A slice of your sweet potato

Sin, girl, he won't want pumpkin again,
No, he won't want
Now I took a trip down to Sissy's
She's a friend of mine
She smiled and asked me in
Well, she drew a box and a big,
Fancy question mark
Said, ""Brother, which one is you in?""
I told her, ""Sister, don't worry 
'bout the mule going blind
You just sit in the wagon and
Hold on to the line
'Cause anyone who's ever had 
Sweet potato pie
Don't want pumpkin again,
Really don't want""

Now I saw the gates 
Gold and pearl
And I sat right down 
In a dream of you, old friend
I'm thinking some milk and 
Honey and a pot of stew
Might fill that gap again
You know, I'm a thankful 
Witness to the things I've seen

And times my head is lighter 
Than it's ever been
And anyone who's ever had 
Sweet potato pie
Really don't want pumpkin again, 
No they won't want

Would you give me some 
Sweet potato y'all",Sweet Potato Pie,1975
Al Jarreau,"Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free

Ever stop to think about a downfall
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Games are to played with toys etcetera
Love is to be made when you're for real
Ups and downs are caused by life in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel

Shady as a lady in a mustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon

The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Al Jarreau,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those, who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on

So excuse my forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Your Song,1976

Better than diving for pearls
Better than skiing in Aspen
Better than feeding the squirrels
Better than finding a horseshoe

Better than singing right out loud
Or being spotted in a crowd
Better than anything except being in love

Do you know, being in love

Better than four sets of Dizzy
Better than Count Basie's band
Better than Rollins and Coltrane
Better than being on the stand
Better than Ella Fitzgerald
Better than Miles' latest news

Better than Bill Evans' ballads
Better than Joe Williams' blues
Better than hearing Lady Day
Or checking in at Monterey
Better than anything except being in love

Do you know, being in love
It's a circus

Elephants dancing
Clowns on parade
Better than peanuts and popcorn
Fresh lemonade
Better than rides on the midway
Better than seals blowing horns
Better than men shot from cannons
Better than fresh ears of corn
Better than balancing a wire
Or watching tigers leap through fire
Better than anything except being in love",Better Than Anything,1977

Courage to carry your freedom up on high
Go 'head and carry your spirit up on high

Oh, I could sing at times and reasons
Reason to lay your burden softly down
Kings and Prophets did for freedom
Precious dreams imprisoned underground
Well, I've got this song that I'll sing
And I'll make the mountains ring
Tell my mama that I am homeward bound

Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
And could you believe precious, precious friend of mine?
Would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
It will give you courage to carry, give you courage to carry up
Just to carry your spirit up on high, Lord
Just to carry your spirit up on high, up on high

Oh yeah, can carry up on, carry
Oh I make this promise, my Lord, I'm gonna carry
Ooh, and I promise to look for that little light
Little bit of light, gonna look for that light
Gonna look for that light bit of light when my heart is in trouble

Oh and I make this promise to look for that light
Little bit of light when my man is worried
You see the same night that brought the children through, yes it is
And it's the same night that brings the spirit through

He'll believe, gonna believe, I'm gonna believe
Don't you believe, I'm gonna believe, I'm gonna believe

Take off them dark sunglasses, 
I'm right here in front of you
Would you open up your eyes?

I need your loving
I need your care and hugging
You can't see nobody
I'm going home
Oh, leter perfect stars of 
Gold in school
You live the Golden Rule",Letter Perfect,1977
Al Jarreau,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
'Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow,1977
Al Jarreau,"Won't you stop and take a little
Time out with me, just take five
Stop your busy day and take the
Time out to see if I'm alive

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way

Wouldn't it be better not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now, it's alright
Just take five, just take five

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Al Jarreau,"I hardly had a bellyful
Never knew a new bicycle
Hand-me-down books and shoes
They brought the yule tides in July

I rode a bus, a train and sometimes
Strolling for miles to a movie show
Singing a song ""Shoobedoo
""While birds and rich folks flew
Right on by

But we got by
Lord knows we got by

Winter wishes wait till June
We brightened July with
That hot dog fun

You bring the beans and I'll
Find the wine

Till 2:00
And sneaking back home with
This girl named Jo
I hurried down to say do""
And stared my first man-child
In the eye

But we got by
Lord knows we got by

And now baby's got his bellyful
And finally here's that new bicycle
Working, praying, June to June
And mama's got LA gleaming
In her eye

And we got by
Lord knows we got by

You see we kept on walking
And talking, hawking
Ooing, cooing, wooing

Flying, trying, sighing, dying.",We Got By,1977
Al Jarreau,"You don't see me when I'm 
Trying to do right
Maybe you can see me now

When I was walking, 
Patting my feet on the pavement
Really, truly trying to find a gig
Did you stand up and speak
Out in my favor?
Cold desperation, 
She's a devil in bed
Scratching till my bones are bare
Pill and needles are all I've left to savor

We were walking and 
I told you of how my shoes 
Of how my shoes were wearing thin
You took your surplus and 
Traded for a favor
Now I'm demented and I'm 
Burned unto a cinder
Forty hours buys a grocery 
Bag for trash
I took my pistol and I made
Myself a sinner
Will this universe be merciful at last?

You don't see me.

Attract your attention

I know you're going to ahead
You're going to do what 
You're going to do
I know, see, I see you, I watch you
You take the money and run

You take groceries and run, too
Don't leave nothing left for me
You're running and hiding 
And ducking and hiding
And running and hiding and
I can't find you nowhere
I'll beat your mama, 
I'll beat your daddy
I'll go to jail, 
It don't make no mothafugging

Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.

Gets info her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing
Alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband

Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How
Could she do this to me?.

Nine clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made

Al Jarreau,"There's a land where lovers dream,
Where poets dwell.

There is always room for one
Who wishes well.

There are doubters who 
Will be welcome too.
When you can't afford the fare,
There's a wish to borrow.

Our love,we must never doubt it.
Our love,when you think about it.
Love like ours will live a 
Thousand years.

Without end.And you're uninspired.

Seem so few

So, I write these words to say
Take heart have faith
In love's tomorrow
Where our precious dreams
Will all come true

Been through
Searching for a heart that's true
Is there one in a million?

Though I've often failed the test
Everyone must journey till
That questioning is through

Shine a star for me to see what
Children see on Christmas morning
Every hope and dream
To be renewed

Heaven only knows how I hope
That chance of love is higher
Than one in a million

But my dreams are only of
The best that we can do

And will not sleep until the dawning

Al Jarreau,"A lullaby my little guy to hush your cryin'
A lullaby you might recall when times are tryin'
And sing every day all that you're realizing
Know every song sung in lightness and Laughter
And don't play too long in the blues that come After
Take her along
Conquer your mountains again

A lullaby my little guy the moon is rising
You'll awake to see a sight that's worth the Prizing
That new morning star high on your heart's Horizon

If you're the one that always says bygones be Bygones
And when you look you've lost the ones
That you rely on
Look deep in your heart there's something to
Keep your eyes on

Cold distant stars slowly fade while you're Sleeping
And hollow guitars will be quietly weeping
So paint the skies with your bright shining
Castles in Spain

Among the things you do each day here's one
For trying
Give it all and give again and find reply in
That new morning star
High on your heart's horizon

Look it over,so much to see
Did I say you should look at me
Not just now
When I'm lookin' around
When my guard is down
Pieces on the ground

In a twinklin' and blinkin' eye
You'll be singing a lullaby
Say just how you can turn it around
When a faith is found
Even on the ground

Lullaby, now don't you cry my Suz and Ryan
So,lullaby and tell them why

Heart's horizon",Heart's Horizon,1988
Al Jarreau,"So you say that I have gone too far
That I really don't know who you are
And did you tell me that you've got to cool your feelings?
So did you say I've fallen overboard
Every danger sign I just ignored
That you never meant to put me out to sea

Ask me where I've been
Heaven knows I've sinned
Waiting in the wings and wasting time
I've been watching you
 
From the secret corners of your mind

[Chorus]
Girl, I know the way to your heart
It's in the stars - you're destined to be my baby
Girl, I'll be so good to your heart
You'll wonder why you question to be my baby

I want to labor looking after you
I want to bless you when you say 'k-choo'

I want to touch your face and watch you while you're sleeping
And could you make a little one or two
And could you please make sure they look like you
And they could share in all the secrets we've been keeping

Have I gone too far?
Reaching for a star?
Heaven here on earth is what I crave
I don't know what to say
I get so carried away
To this dream I'll always be a slave

A torch to my dreams all night

Should have been there for you, to care for you
With more love, more love

I could have given you the gifts I threw to total strangers
Passing through my nights
I could have cuddled near your gentle flame
Been warmer there than in these glaring lights

Should have had more time to spare for you
Should have been there for you, to care for you
With more love, more love, more love

What would it have taken if only could have taken
My eyes off me for a while
I'd have seen the hurtin' hidin' just behind the curtain of your smile
Oh, I swear I didn't know, which goes to show
How long it takes a man to be a man
But if I say enough
And try enough
And pray enough
And cry enough
I can still can
Have more time to spare for you

We can sing a simple song

Can we sing that part again
All about how we will win
Gotta know how in the end nothin's dyin'
And the ribbon in the sky
Is the vision in your eye

What a day for seeing you

And the love of which I sing
Is like the phoenix on the wing
We started, we parted, we found
We're fond of flyin'

The autum moments of a night without you
Endless seconds
Watching one window pain fight back the rain
While I'm trapped here inside your love

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
You And I had an everlasting love that ended way before it's time
Scattered like the stars in the sky
Are the feelings that I have for you that never got to shine
And it cuts me to the core
But I keep coming back for more
As long as love remains, then it's pleasure over pain

Saying every line I should have said,
Knowing every little move that I should have made instead
Tortured by a mind that won't forget
And my heart is like a butterfly trapped inside your net
And it's breaking me into
But for you it is the least I'd do
As long as love remains, then it's pleasure over pain

Hear the seconds ticking by
Praying that you'll change your mind
Breaking every rule I know
Ready to give up my pride
Waiting for a second chance
Have I waited way too long
If I had you here again 
You would never leave I know
Here I am again tonight

Am I gettin' through to you or am I wasting time

Hard to gain, and hard to hold

Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone, and it hurts so much

Well and why
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry?

Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live

Until you use me up 

My brother sit me right down and he talked to me

				",If I Ever Lose This Heaven,1997
Al Jarreau,"Mornin' Mr. Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister Oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine
In my mind

Mornin' Mr. Shoe Shine Man
Shine 'em bright in white and tan
My baby said she loves me and
Need I tell you that
Everything here is just fine
In my mind

'Scuse me if I sing
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now at last I know

Mornin' Mr. Golden Gate
I should walk but I can't wait
I can't wait to set it straight
I was shakin' but now I am
Makin' it fine
Here in my mind

My heart will soar
With love that's rare and real
My smiling face will feel every cloud
Then higher still
Beyond the blue until
I know I can
Like any man
Reach out my hand
And touch the face of GOD

'Scuse me if I sing
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now at last I know

Mornin' Mr. Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister Oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine
Wooo in my mind

So, won't you get up Oriole
So, won't you get up Cheerios
Wake up Mr. Radio
It's fine
Here in my mind

Singin' about mornin' little radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Wake up Mr. Radio
Need I tell you everything
Right here is just doing fine",Mornin',1998
Al Jarreau,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day,1998
Al Jarreau,"I can't believe that it's real, 
The way that you make me feel. 
A burning deep down inside, 
A love that I cannot hide. 
Our love is you and me baby, 
That makes the world go round. 
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me, 
Layin' all my troubles down, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me. 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me, 
Take me by the hand. 
Show me, 
Here I am, baby. 

It always ends up this way, 
Me begging you every day. 
A love that I cannot have, 
You broke my heart into half. 
Our love is you and me baby, 
That make's the world go round. 
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me, 
Layin' all my troubles down, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me, 
Take me by the hand. 
Show me, 
Here I am, baby. 

When I'm down I can always call you, 
For a helpin' hand. 
I know you'll do the best you can. 
But it don't take much from me, 
Just my cup of joe. 
Oh there's love inside me, 
I believe there's one to be explodin', 
It's tough for me, oh baby, 
I can do worry, 
Tell me all your troubles. 
You won't ever have to worry now, 
Just one more thing, ask everybody, 
Everybody you see, 
You'll find yourselve lost and alone on a darkened street, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me.

Come and take me, 
Take me by the hand.

Al Jarreau,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me

It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
She's always gone too long 
Any time she goes away 

Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away 

I know 
I leave the young thing alone

Al Jarreau,"Oh happiness is two kinds of ice cream
Finding your skate key, telling the time

And happiness is learning to whistle
Tying your shoe for the very first time

Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band
And happiness is walking hand in hand

And happiness is five different crayons
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree

Happiness is finding a nickel
Catching a firefly, setting it free

And happiness is being alone every now and then
And happiness is coming home again

Happiness is singing together when day is through
And happiness is those who sing with you

And happiness is morning and evening
Daytime and nighttime too

For happiness is anyone and anything at all
That is loved by you",Happiness,2000
Al Jarreau,"So close and yet so smart
Head first before the heart
Ain't no shame
Ain't no game
With the flame

Coldwaters rush in March
No place for April flowers
Take her name
Say she came
With the flame

I've been told when the stars all align
That even bitter lips like mine
Will call the moon a friend and kiss again
Some I'm told let their hearts read the signs
While other men are hungerin'
And can't let it in

Be still my foolish heart
Please don't upset the cart
Stay the same
Ain't no game
With the flame

I've been told I'll be dancin in time
Walkin' rhythm', talkin' rhyme
The earth will turn and send the sun again
All my gold for a light or a sign
Some kind of kin to say my friend
Let it out - let it in

Strange fire down below
So 'fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start the game
With the flame

Strange fire down below
So 'fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame
The flame 
The flame",Flame,2000

Look in their eyes long enough
You will know

Each one is God's Gift to the World.

That all the lonely people
First ones and the last ones
All the great and small ones
Ones that win and lose
To all of those remembered
And even those forgotten
To every single, single nation
I believe these words are true
For me and you

We are (we are)
They Are (they are)
Each one is God's gift to the world

This one (talkin bout this one),
That one (talkn bout that one),

Don't forget about the babies (the babies)
Don't forget about the soldiers ( the soldiers)
This one and that one and
This one and that one

Don't you turn away, something I say
Could keep her faithful and true

Used to say, satin, silk and lace
Fascinate a pretty face
Bet you're life she'll stay
I was stunned, struck dumb y'all
Total strangers when she walked away, she told me

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real we make a melody down in my soul

Callin' all players, Don Juan, Romeo too
Please dont' turn away, everything I say
Is with affection for you

Like you're blind, deaf, and dumb, every dreams' undone
Only one way to hold her
Be for real before she walks away

About you, I thought about you (2x)

Al Jarreau,"Puddit it in your pocket
Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

Corner of your office
Floor boards of your car
BB King sure keeps 'em
In that blues guitar

No matter where you go
Whatever game you play
Never leave home without some
Put some in everyday

To keep it in your laughter
Twinkle in your eye
Up in all your rafters
Underneath your tie

Puddit in your chapel
Underneath the pew
All your kids in chapter
Skipin' back to school

No matter where you go
Whatever game you play
Don't you leave home without some
Puddit in everyday

When the people start to roar
We, come back for more

Puddit it in your pocket
Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

One more last suggestion
Teach 'em every move
When they pop the question
Tell 'em it's the groove

",Puddit [Put It Where You Want It],2000
Al Jarreau,"I clearly recall the moments
Your face, the rain in Paris, a distant bell
Now, inside my head, I still recall the moment
There was something that you said

And now, only now, if somehow I were younger
Nimble little fingers remember each melody
Melodies and days that I adored
Flower vases, cathedral doors

So long to sailin', safe by my door
Sunny place inside, comforting is all paid for
Too late for some change of mind, ohh, how would I ever find me?
Through rain and crying you were saying

Every heart is safe inside a place
That makes and shapes the changing
Make the change, sail away beyond the wishing star
Dreamers gettin' armor

Froze in the altitudes, toasting the latitudes
Old empty platitudes, tossing, turning, freezing and burning
Comin' around, comin' around, settlin' down
Comin' around, settlin' down

Ice cream and thunder, night beasts and butterflies
Most mornin's I'd settle for a little rain
I'll let it in and let it out, I'll blow it over, coda
Start all over again, makin' the bitter end a friend

Play that restless melody for me again
The one I've been, been so afraid of my sweet friend
Maybe the little refrain will whisper inside the rain again
Play the one with all the changes

Some lullabies for sleeping, a lullaby for weeping
And one to teach my heart to fight and win
Singing a sailin' song
Sun song, sun song

Now inside my head I still recall the moment
There was something that you said
I live inside the moment
Hearing something that you said

How still inside the moment
There was something that you said
Remarkable and wonderful
This something that you said

",Something That You Said,2000
Al Jarreau,"Come to me, whenever you're in time of need
I won't melt away like a fair-weather friend
On me you can depend

If I may, I'd like to take this time to say
I'll be by your side 'till the sun grows dark
And the moon brings light of day

Oh it's me for you and you for me that's how it's got to be
Though fainter hearts may come and go
Here's one thing you'll always know

Through it all, you can depend on me when tears begin to fall
And I will chase the clouds away
Through it all, I will ease your pain when sorrows comes to call
Oh, through it all

When you say you've never been loved quiet this way
I have to smile and take credit for being
The first to truly say

Oh, through it all a spirit that's brighter by far
Then all of the stars that shine through the night
You glow with heaven's light

Oh, it's me for you and you for me that's how it got to be
Though love affairs may come and go
Here's one thing you always know

Through it all, you can depend on me when tears begin to fall
And I will chase the clouds away
Through it all, and I will ease your pain when sorrows comes to call
Through it all, through it all

No empty promises you can be sure
We've both been down this road
And this time it's so much more, so much more

Through it all, through it all
Through it all, I will ease your pain
When sorrows comes to call I will stop the rain
Through it all

I'll be here beside you
The pain and rain can't hide you
I'll be here beside you

Like how d'you get so far from home
A little bit of paradise

By so many people whose dreams won't begin to be realized.

Do all the things we do and you'll be good to go.

Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in

I can't explain the silver rain that found me
Or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found
Me, suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the Midnight Sun
Midnight Sun

Was there such a night,
It's a thrill I still don't quite believe,
And yet when you were gone,
There was still some stardust on
My sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
Or I may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
I saw the Midnight Sun.",Midnight Sun,2004
Al Jarreau,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2004

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms 
And I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

It's you 
I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me

Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear

Lives my favorite girl.
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown-ups all wear.

In the sun she dances
To silent music-songs
That are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head

Then one day all too soon
She'll grow up & she'll leave her doll
And her prince & her silly old bear.

When she goes they will cry
As they whisper good-bye

They will miss her I know
But then so will I.

Al Jolson,"Yesterday I watched two love birds in a tree
Just bill and coo, like love birds do
I began to envy them when suddenly
One flew away, far away just like you

Like a birdie, you flew away from the nest
Never said goodbye to me, went and left me up a tree
Don't know if you flew to the east or the west
Just know that since you have flown
I'm all alone, so depressed

Some strange bird came along
There is no doubt
And sang a different song
While I was out
Evidently you liked the new song the best
Like a birdie you flew away from the nest.

I often wondered who took you away
If it was a blackbird or a jay
If a cuckoo bird took you from me
Huh! You gone cuckoo, I can see
Couldn't be an eagle, `cause that bird
Wouldn't fly so low
I wouldn't be surprised
To know that you fell for some old crow

Like a birdie, you flew away from the nest
Never said goodbye to me, went and left me up a tree
Don't know if you flew to the east or the west

No wife to obey

They built a little hut
Lived there till Friday, but
Saturday night it was shut

And on Sunday morning they'd come staggering home
They went hunting for rabbits when the weather grew colder
But Crusoe came home with a hare on his shoulder
Now, where did Robinson Crusoe go with Friday on Saturday night?

Robinson Crusoe was a good old scout
Robinson Crusoe knew his way about
He'd go out hunting chickens now and then
But he knew when
He was chasing a hen
Once he told Friday, ""You must stay at home
I've got to go out alone""
Friday felt very blue
He said, ""It's wrong of you
Couldn't you fix it for two?""

Where did Robinson Crusoe go with Friday on Saturday night?
One fine Saturday night they had nothing to do
So they started counting all the girlies they knew
Friday counted to thirteen, and Crusoe said, ""Brother,

Al Jolson,"Down Hawaii way, where I chanced to stray, 
On an evening I heard a Hula maiden play, 
Yaaka hula hickey dula, Yaaka hula hickey du. 
Down Hawaii way, by the moonlit bay, 
When I lingered awhile, she stole my heart away, 
Yaaka hula hickey dula, Yaaka hula hickey du.

You'd forget about them all if you could hear.

Down Hawaii way, you would love to stay, 
On an evening I heard a Hula maiden play, 
Yaaka hula hickey dula, Yaaka hula hickey du. 
Down Hawaii way, while the breakers play, 
With a movement just like the waves, those Hulas say, 
""Yaaka hula hickey dula, Yaaka hula hickey du."" 
Oh, I don't care if you're never, never loved before, 
You'll be captivated on that coral shore.

Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er

Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain
Wailing for the lost one that comes not again
Oh! I long for Jeannie, and my heart bows low
Never more to find her where the bright waters flow

I sigh for Jeannie, but her light form strayed
Far from the fond hearts round her native glade
Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown
Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone

Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore
While her gentle fingers will cull them no more

So I think I'll travel on

Across the sea where flying fishes play.

The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day?,2012

She pulled my dick back like a banana pealin'
Her throat game platinum worth a million
Put her on a track we can make a killin'
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose

Pierced toungue ring big lips and breasts

Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again

Al Kooper,"Last night I had a dream that the world
Was changing by leaps and bounds
It started up in the bigger cities
Than it spread to the smaller towns

The people began to smile at people
That they’d never even seen
And when Jeremiah woke me up
I was ready to live that dream

Well, it’s a brand new day
Brand new way, brand new day
Give it to me, alright

You know the mother called the father on the telephone
She cried, ""My God I’m so upset""
She said the boy left home naked this morning
All he took was the TV set

Than the sister picked up the extension
And she said, “He’s just doing his thing”
Than the father hung up on the mother
And the children began to sing

Well, it’s a brand new day, yes
A brand new way, brand new day

We gotta put our heads together
And see where we go from there
We gotta fight for what we believe in
'Cause there’s something in the air

And it’s a brand new day, that's right
Brand new way, brand new day
I can feel it growing stronger every minute now

Twenty million shadows storming at the gates
Now how can you be surprised?
With the image of the fallen four reflected in their eyes

And though twenty million tongues are shouting now
It's only heard by a precious few
But the years of night will pass forever
When the sun comes shining through

On a brand new day
Brand new way, yes, a brand new day

Hey people, you know that it's a brand new day
Brand new way, brand new way you're walking
Brand new day, yes, a brand new way
Go ahead now

And it's alright, yes, it's alright
And it's alright now, it's alright
And it's alright, yes, it's alright
And it's alright

Al Kooper,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
How can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain",Visions of Johanna,2005

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,

I want to take her in my arms, the ache is there so deep inside me

Nothin's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing a rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
Then my Mary wakes to love another day, aah-umm

And Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather
She doesn't care 'cause right or wrong the love we share, we share together

Nothin's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening

I saw the lights of a cozy place with lanterns all aglow
Somebody cried, ""Don't wait outside, come say, hello""

And from the jukebox I heard the sounds, I needed to recall
I sang along with every song, I knew them all

It's so nice and warm in here, we're happy and kind
We can understand that you're a long way from home
But we have each other, have no fear, you'll like it here

It's not so easy to feel at home when home's so far away
When all the longing and all the wanting is for yesterday
You've made me find some peace of mind I'd like to stay

The world seems colder when you're a stranger from a foreign land
You need to feel that someone cares and that they understand
Many a tear would disappear if we joined hands

In the summer of our life
In the magic of love
Storms above scattered away

Reaching for paradise

Love slips away

On an empty stretch of beach
In the pattern of the waves
Drawing pictures with my hand
In the sand, I see your face

Skipping pebbles on the sea
Wishing for paradise
Sand castles crumble below
The restless tides ebb and flow
Listening to a shell
Hoping for your voice

Though we'll always be apart
Locked forever in a dream
If I ever love again

Clinging to paradise

I fall in love again

The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love,

Ooh, did I tell you I need you

Al McKibbon,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning

Al McKibbon,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too
Your answer was 'Goodbye'
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'

Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear

Al McKibbon,"Once you said you loved me
Placed no one above me
Prayed for me to make that vow
What dumb thing did I say
So busy being blasé
How I wish you'd ask me now

I was vain and bind then
Prone to be unkind then
Wish they'd turn back time somehow
Then I was audacious
I ignored what was precious
How I wish you'd ask me now

I thought then I'd always be
Footloose and fancy free
How could I have been so blind
What I once made light of turned out to be true love

Once my ego ruled me
Flattered me and fooled me
More times than the laws allow
You asked me could I care

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2002
Al Nevins,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace 

You got it",I Know You Got Soul,2005

Warms an old implacable heart such as mine

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream.

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one""
In my frightened arms, those polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled round a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we crowded over the floor.
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilac and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll always see those polka dots and moonbeams

Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words, ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end

Al Porcino & His Orchestra,"What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

For all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Al Raymond,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Al Raymond,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996
Al Raymond,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1996
Al Raymond,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1997
Al Raymond,"Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""

Al Raymond,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it
