John Wesley Harding,"Maybe you're insecure
Neck deep in life's manure
Maybe your heart's impure
Inured to all small compensations
Maybe you're born to lose
Could be caught out or confused
Wearing the condemned man's shoes
Worn out, beyond a warning
There might be one million ills that ail ya
But why do you take pleasure in other people's failure?

Each day since time began
You'll meet a modest man
Who says he understands
Your plans, your dreams, your schemes, your feelings
But rather you than me
That's his mentality
He's a slave to gravity
And he watches laughing as you fall down
He doesn't even have to nail ya
That's why he takes pleasure in other people's failure

It is a rule of thumb
Inside the coliseum
That when the time will come
We'd rather see the losers slaughtered
And no-one can resist
This vicarious kiss
It is our greatest bliss
The twist that gives success its flavour
A psychopathic psychedelia....
That's why we take pleasure in other people's failure",Other People's Failure,1996
John Wesley Harding,"The secret angel fell from grace
Condemned to wear a human face
Evicted from her paradise
Excommunicated twice
Settled for second best
And so she found me

Don't ask the nature of her crime
Don't ask her why she's serving time
Don't ask this girl why she can't cry
Don't ask her questions that start ""why""

I'm trying to help her start anew
To learn to walk when once she flew
Above the ups and downs
That floor and ground us

Into the dark, she was reborn
She says tonight will have no dawn
And all the light drains from her eyes
As she forgets to say goodbye
To one more memory
That tries to lift her high

She drafts new plans and draws designs
To find a way for her to fly
I hide them when her back is turned
The secret angel never learns
She just gets burned again
And falls eternally...",The Secret Angel,1996
John Wesley Harding,"I've lived my life backwards
Or heaven knows I've tried
Hope I find my perfection before I die
Maybe once we were fantastic

Maybe once we were divine
Now we're flailing in the wake
Of progress passing by
At the speed of normal

Ever since you were the baby
You've been trying to grow up
But that's nothing that a therapist can cure
There's an unconfirmed report

Or could it be a cruel hoax
That death is just the punchline
To a tall tale told
At the speed of normal

So for everyone who's anyone
And you know who you are
Hope you don't drop behind in the hundred yards war
The winners and the losers

Overtaken in the end
By their very shadows
Taking the last bend
At the speed of normal",The Speed of Normal,1996
John Wesley Harding,"I saw you yesterday
I couldn't let you be
I had to sift through broken glass
To find out if you missed me
But all I found was a slow fade
And a gift-wrapped box of band aids
With a note that said I'm never coming home

Beneath my single bed
Everything's haphazard
There's boxes full of bits of you
And none of them are numbered
And when I search, it's deja vu
Things I think I knew
I should have thrown away this time last year

Everytime I touch you
You move so slow
And you're still like your photo

I heard me yesterday
Repeating my own name
To convince myself
That none of us had changed
And now I'm walking round the grooves
Of a record I lost when we moved
There's dust and scratches mixed with all these tears

Everytime I touch you
You move so slow
And you're still like your photo

Should we throw it all away
The failed long shots through far distant styles
Those forced smiles, those forced smiles
It started so on the mark
But it missed by one million miles

Nothing has developed
This darkroom gets me down
I'd throw on all the lights
But I'm afraid you'd come around
You're living in a limbo hell
A life that's only parallel
Is the real you aware what's going on? 

Everytime I touch you
You move so slow
And you're still like your photo",Still Photo,1996
John Wesley Harding,"To whom it may concern
Whatever your address
I didn't think I'd have the nerve
To write this I confess

To get it off my chest
But now that I have your attention
I must make sure I get it right

To whom it may concern
Dear madam or sir
I don't know your name
Or if you'll ever read these words

I know that sounds absurd
I know you don't know who I am
You know that we haven't met
Yet

And I hope this is alright with you
I hope this is alright with you
I remain your faithful servant

To whom it may concern
Let me cut to the chase
We're gonna have to meet one time
Before we quit this place

Gone without a trace
And you may have already won
So please fill out this questionnaire
And say a prayer

To whom it may concern
Now we will begin
I'm not gonna post this
I'll just throw it in the wind

And wonder where it lands
But I know that it will reach you somehow
I know that it will be received
I must believe

I hope we'll be alright with you
I hope we'll be alright with you
I remain your faithful servant...",To Whom It May Concern,1996
John Wesley Harding,"I sing of the triumph of trash
The rise to success of hard cash
The birth of annihilation
The end of my patience
I sing of the triumph of trash

Trash is the product of greed
Selfishness planted the seed
Everybody knows
Money makes it grow
Trash is the product of greed

Trash needs nostalgia to breathe
It brings a familiar relief
Deja vu is all that matters
Unless we predicted it, it never happened
Trash needs nostalgia to breathe

Trash is at once high and low
It panders to the worst parts of both
We're so pleased we're in agreement
Our heads in clouds, our feet in cement
Trash is at once high and low

Hope is left out in the cold
Looking for pieces of gold
Our refuse has no limits
She tries to live in it
Hope is left out in the cold

I sing of the triumph of trash
The past is a grate full of ash
No morals and no sinners
So there's no losers and no winner
And I sing of the triumph of trash",The Triumph of Trash,1996
John Wesley Harding,"If I die tomorrow
Don't read too much into this song
I'll be as surprised as you are
I always get predictions wrong
If I die tomorrow
Break out and play my best guitars
Don't put this one in the Hard Rock Cafe
In a case above the bar
I'd like to take this chance to say good-bye
You want the answers, don't look in my eyes

You're asking me my opinion
Well, baby, we're all gonna burn
So light up and wait your turn in the fire
I'm telling you my decision
Baby we're all gonna burn
There will be no return
'cause baby we're all gonna burn
 
 If I die tomorrow
There's one thing I'd ask of you
A favour for your favourite friend
When his living days are through
Make sure it's me up on the funeral pyre
Make sure the house band's playing Light My Fire

You're asking me my opinion
Well, baby, we're all gonna burn
So light up and wait your turn in the fire
I'm telling you my decision
Baby we're all gonna burn
There will be no return
'cause baby we're all gonna burn",Burn,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I'm staying here and I'm not buying a gun
I'll just take my trouble as it comes
I know you've got it in for me
But I don't give a damn
I'd rather die while trying
Than to give up who I am
Please tell everyone
I'm staying here and I'm not buying a gun

I'm staying here and I don't care who knows
No-one has the highs without the lows
I know prescriptions you can write me
For everything I need
But I don't need a band-aid, doctor
Til I start to bleed
Please tell everyone
I'm staying here and I'm not buying a gun

Come on, Pilgrim
Come on, Pilgrim
I'm staying here and I'm not buying a gun

I'm staying here, I hope you've got the news
You got me and someone else confused
I know you thought I'd turn and run away
When it all went wrong
But you'll be saying",I'm Staying Here (And I'm Not Buying a Gun),1998
John Wesley Harding,"There's pollen flying down the holland tunnel
And the hotel's full of mud and unmade clay
There are rumors coasting in on fumes and vapors
And there's no more gas for anyone today

There's an earthquake where the milkshakes are perfection
And a tv that we leave on all the day
There's apostrophes for anyone who needs them
And quotation marks round everything you say

And it's all your fault
I'm sorry that I wrote this song
It's all your fault, it's all my fault
It won't be long

There's some rifle sights high on the eiffel tower
Trying to pick off anyone who's french
""You're spoiled for choice"" a voice calls down from heaven
""So shoot someone or get back on the bench""

There's a supermarket where the ark is grounded
In frozen foods, we feel the wind and snow
There's a two for one deal at the checkout
All that's yet to come is priced to go

And it's all your fault
I'm sorry that I wrote this song
It's all your fault, it's all my fault
It won't be long

And your details are for sale like sacred relics
And your real name has already been used
Face to face sounds mostly like an echo
And when we touch feels mostly like a bruise

And it's all your fault
I'm sorry that I wrote this song
It's all your fault, it's all my fault
It won't be long",It's All My Fault,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I was born with a coat hanger in my mouth
Oh yeah, and I was dumped down south
I was found by the richest man in the world
Oh yeah, who bought me up as a girl
My sheets are satin but my mind's a mess
But there are worse things I confess
Than drinking tea in a pretty dress
And I'm here to tell you that it's not all bad
Count your blessings and maybe you'll be glad

When he died, I inherited his wealth
Oh yeah and I revealed my self
I was snubbed by the friends he'd never had
Oh yeah, who sided with my dad
All my riches are beyond control
But it's the same old rigmarole
They say I've lost my very soul
Maybe I have
But I'm here to tell you that it's not all bad
Count your blessings and maybe you'll be glad

And as I grew so did my fame
So I gave it up and changed my name
It's catch as catch can and
You'll never know who I am

When I died, I hoped to hear the angel's song
Oh yeah, but was I wrong
They threw me back there in that lane
Oh yeah and they said ""start again""
So when you're turning out the bedside light
Consider me and my wretched plight
Looks like I'm gonna have to get it right this time
But I'm here to tell you that it's not all bad
Count your blessings and maybe
You'll be glad",Miss Fortune,1998
John Wesley Harding,"Poor heart
What to do? 
Dim the light
There's no respite
For you

Poor heart
Can you see? 
Or will you beat
A sad retreat for me
Poor heart? 

Poor mouth
Poor eyes
Poor soul
Poor mind
Poor start
Poor heart

Poor heart
Look around
Who else remains
Who can contain
Your frown? 

Poor heart
Why so vain? 
Are you rich enough
To play so rough
Again
Poor heart? 

Poor heart
Poor eyes
Poor soul
Poor mind
Poor start
Poor heart

Poor heart
Play your part
Nothing's done
Til it is sung

John Wesley Harding,"Dear mum
Everything's gone wrong
And I wish I'd listened to what you said
The times you sat down on my bed

And told me 'bout my life
Told me 'bout my life
Dear mum
I've been out of touch

I guess I just didn't need you that much
But now I'll scream and shout
'cause I've got something to write home about

Dear mum
Everything has changed
I don't know if you'd know me today
I wonder what we'd have to say

When I told you 'bout my life
Now everything's a blur
I know what happened but lost the words
We can't live without
Now I've got something to write home about

And so
It's time to go
I'm glad we've had this time alone
It almost felt like time at home
Before I went away
Now I've got something to write home about",Something to Write Home About,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I wish I could go back in time
Tell you it has turned out fine
Like it has, like it has, like it has
I sit here singing in the sun
Words not meant for anyone
Just you, just you, just you
'Cause this is the song, this is the song
Oh yeah
This is the song that I wrote myself in the future

The air was shot of hope
Knots became your name for the rope
Then the noose, then the noose, then the noose
You put it down and found it made no sense
You bought the farm and then you built the fence
At your expense, at your expense
And this is the song, this is the song
Oh yeah
This is the song that I wrote myself in the future
 
I know it's hard as you hear this for you to see
The desperation you feel now will disappear one day
For you, for me

'Cause this is the song, this is the song
Oh yeah
This is the song that you wrote yourself in the future",Song I Wrote Myself in the Future,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I am here
You are here too my dear
We're drowning in the sun
We're so near
We're getting closer and
We're sweat tears blood and come

We are now
Our skin is fusing somehow
What will we become?
Why write songs?
They only turn out wrong
Sweat tears blood and come

But I think that I know
That I want more of you
 
 What are we?
Some future yet to be?
The present leaves me numb
Look at you
There's so much left of you to do
Sweat tears blood and come

But I think that I know
That I want more of you

We're inside
Who would want to hide?
Who would need to run?
We're afloat
The bed's a drunken boat
Of sweat tears blood and come",Sweat Tears Blood and Come,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I was bought on by my mother as her carry-on
She had me in the toilet when the seat-belt sign was on
I crawled up to the captain down the other end
I hid under the seats that's where I played pretend
And I ate the wild pretzel and the nuts that fell
And the screech of brakes was all I knew for my schoolbell
And I know I've got the whole world at my feet
In my window seat

I learned to eat the sweet, I learned to swallow hard
I learned to ease the pressure with free playing cards
Spent my teenage setting off all of the smoke alarms
Then running down the alley saying "";please stay calm"";
Met the girl in 7B, we tried to settle down
But we couldn't reach the aisle before we hit the ground
And I know I've got the whole world at my feet
In my window seat

And now the sisters of the sky think I'm deaf and dumb
As I wait around for upgrades that will never come
But I know that we will one day sit on his right hand
Be his automatic pilot when this plane must land
And the stewardess of Babylon will spread her arms
And show us all a thing or two about her charms
We'll be tempted by the devil with the magic wand
He'll make us stand with arms outstretched then wave us on
Into the great beyond (our boarding passes gone)
And I know I've got the whole world at my feet
In my window seat",Window Seat,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I'm gonna fill me full of coffee
Just to drown the nicotine
I'll do a slow striptease
Then wash my body clean

I'm gonna go to bed too early
Just to keep me still
Then I'll lie there quiet
Try to write my will

Then I'll dream that I am with you
Oh, to hide inside your hair
I'll be so quiet that
You won't know I'm there

Visit me tonight
Come like dust under the door
Here's a key
And you know what it's for

But, oh
Do you know
I love you so
You so and so

I never took a breath before
I never wrote a song
My body is in trouble
I've been out of it so long

But I want to be inside right now
And only you know when
Just one kiss would bring me back
Again

But, oh
Do you know
I love you so
You so and so

",You So & So,1998
John Wesley Harding,"I was breathing not sleeping nor having the choice
I was brushed by the skirts of a ghost with your voice
You were drowned in the buzz of the humming machines
And you were looking at me
You're looking at me

A strange conversation in the visiting room
The big smile of ignorance shone like the moon
What I wanted to say was lost at sea
'Cause you were looking at me
You're looking at me

Being your sleeper what should I do but tend
Enhanced in your beauty, silent shining friend
Sunburned and bruised where no-one can see
You were looking at me
You're looking at me

Where is the dreamer when night makes it's slide
And light takes a candle to shine on inside
And is it a dream that no-one can see
That you're looking at me? 
You're looking at me",You're Looking at Me,1998
John Wesley Harding,"You ghost visits every night at midnight
I can hear the clanking of your chains
First it frightened me but now somehow
I'm glad to see you've come again

And I used to be so terrified to hear you
Moaning like the hinges on the door
But now that late night sound is like a lullaby to me
Though I know I won't be sleeping anymore
I know I won't be sleeping anymore

[Chorus]
Your ghost, your ghost
Opens the door
Your ghost, your ghost
Don't scare me no more
Don't scare me no more

Every night we sit up in the darkness
Talk about whatever's on your mind
Someone did away with you and so you're doomed to limbo
That's another theory you've opined
That's a spooky theory you've opined

[Chorus]
Your ghost, your ghost
Creeps on the floor
Your ghost, your ghost
Don't scare me no more
Don't scare me no more

Your ghost and my human living body
Turns out that we are the best of friends
If the story is you're coming back to haunt me
Then I'm pleased to say it has a happy end",Your Ghost (Don't Scare Me No More),1998
John Wesley Harding,"Last night I was out driving
Coming home at the end of the working day
I was riding alone through the drizzling rain
On a deserted stretch of a county two-lane
When I came upon a wreck on the highway

There was blood and glass all over
And there was nobody there but me
As the rain tumbled down hard and cold
I seen a young man lying by the side of the road
He cried ""Mister, won't you help me please""

An ambulance finally came and took him to Riverside
I watched as they drove him away
And I thought of a girlfriend or a young wife
And a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night
To say your baby died in a wreck on the highway

Sometimes I sit up in the darkness
And I watch my baby as she sleeps
Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight
I just lay there awake in the middle of the night
Thinking 'bout the wreck on the highway",Wreck on the Highway [Live][*],1998
John Wesley Harding,"I'm looking for those old familiar faces
In the places I left behind
All the townsons, barnes and staces
And some good old friends of mine

Because everyone is someone
That I seem to recognize
Must be the old familiar faces
In their eyes

I'm walking down these streets that have no signposts
In a language that I know
And I never will belong here
And it's clear that one day I'll go

But when I turn the corner
There's another memory
Why don't those old familiar faces
Let me be

I used to live a life without a present
And no need to go back when
But now I see the truth so clearly
And I want it her back again

She hosts the ghosts of people
In the shadows all around
Until the old familiar faces
Fill this town

Everyday I feel the sun shine stronger
On the dark side of my heart
And people look like strangers now
That I can't tell apart

So I smile and nod politely
Like they're friends that I once knew
I've found those old familiar faces
In you",$55,1998
John Wesley Harding,"The brain of Britain sits in the tower of London
Protected by the ravens
The prime-minister and the cabinet queue up to consult it
On urgent matters of state
And it sits suspended in fluid
Attached to ten electrodes
It's a scene straight out of Star Wars or Star Trek

The brain of Britain masterminds the nation
From this curious vantage point
It's an oracle, it's a magic eight-ball
That can give out just three answers
(and here they are)
It's the best kept secret of all
The politicians are pawns to the power
Of a prime piece of meat called
The brain of Britain

The brain of Britain was born into this limbo
It knows no other existence
Its consciousness floats like an island
Communicating only by pulse
The queen swears allegiance to the brain
But the future king wants to kick it
Through the streets of London like a football
And that means trouble

The brain of Britain has no wizard of oz
Pulling the protein strings
Science can't explain the super brain away
And that's the terrifying thing
Cause the brain can't see the world
It can't see the big picture
Just a color-by-numbers before the next election",The Brain of Britain,1998
John Wesley Harding,"Juliet said to the night air
'wherefore art thou romeo? '
He was beneath the balcony
Hearing a word he didn't know
Romeo said to juliet
What does 'wherefore' mean?

Snow white said to cinders
'the prince is always gone
Fighting wars and inviting whores
To sing him love's sweet song'

'charming's only letting off steam
He's a gentleman
And we're only a gentleman's dream'

Amy said to the warden
When I turn on my tv
There's always someone I recognise
And she's much better looking than me'
Warden said 'lolita

John Wesley Harding,"Darling, when you sit up and stare all night
I get the feeling that something ain't right
My heart starts to beat on my drum-tight skin
I just wanna kick it in
I know you start weeping when you think that I'm sleeping
I know you know that you just can't win
But I'll try my best
You know honey I swear I will

Darling, you pretend to sleep but I know it's a lie
This bed is wet from the tears you cry
I lie there frustrated, don't know what to do
Sometimes I can't get through to you
I know you can't explain what's giving you pain
And you just can't contain all your blues
But I'll try my best
You know that I have sworn I will

So now if you wanna come out and talk about it
I'll try to understand
If you wanna yell it, scream it, please shout it
And I'll try to understand
But for now you know I just can't stand
To see this sand
Slipping out of my hand

Darling, when you just can't take it anymore
Shout it out, now, tell me what you're crying for
Don't let it rage inside, that won't help you none
Be like staring into the barrel of a loaded gun
I will help you feel more self-assured
And even if it cuts to the core
I'll try to take it like a man
Yeah, I'll try my best
Honey I swear I will

So now if you wanna come out and talk about it
I'll try to understand
If you wanna yell it, scream it, please shout it
And I'll try to understand
But for now you know I just can't stand
To see this sand
Slipping out of my hand

John Wesley Harding,"Those resourceful romeos have all revealed
You're the juliet who couldn't be genteel
All the parents looked askance with much displeasure
As you dared to dance off with their little treasures
And the teachers who preached anguish and abstention
Treated you with distant condescension
Patronised your youthful indignation
With their idiotic indoctrination
Then gave you bad grades just for being clever
And you're qualified to be in debt for ever
And you'll wonder what you did
And you'll think you don't deserve it
When the bad things, bad things
When all the bad things in your life turn to worth it

All the candidates who claim to know your fears
Shit silence like it's verbal diarrhoea
Imply that your suggestions are so tired
Like they aspired to something higher
They gonna sack you when you give them the wrong answers
Or for failing to respond to his advances
And you're faced with a senator's enquiry
Sequestering your private life in diaries
Those wretched romeos now politicians
Telling all the truth but with omissions
And you'll think that you've been blessed
And you thought that you were cursed
When all the bad things, bad things
When all the bad things in your life turn to worth it

The pages fly, the calendar gets thinner
Springs turns into summer into winter
Preachers will illuminate their candles
On romeos with trousers round their ankles

The politicians surrender to indictment
The teachers sacked for lack of excitement
But these are not the reasons you endure
Revenge could never please a heart so pure
You thought your reward would be in heaven
Or a day job at the 7-11
While everyone around you ran for cover
You found a secret, now your name is love
And you'll wonder what you did
And you'll think you don't deserve it

When all the bad things in your life turn to worth it
When all the bad things in your life turn to worth it

As the cowboy lies dying in the dust
She walks through the room where the gentlemen gather
Surrounded by debris and rust

And hope to die of middle age

And I rang that thing like hell

To the doctor I was sent
To cure my broken bones

Til I had to give to him
A taste of his own medicine

One pleasant evening in the month of June
The pleasant singing blackbird
His charming notes to tune
Then I saw a woman
All in great grief and woe
Conversing with young Bonaparte
Concerning the bonny bunch of roses

And then up and spoke the young Napoleon
And he took hold of his mother's hand
Oh mother dear be patient
And soon I will take command
I'll raise a terrible army
And through tremendous danger go
And in spite of all of the universe
I'll conquer the bonny bunch of roses, oh

And when first you saw the great Napoleon
You fell down on your bended knee
And you asked your father's life of him
And he's granted it most manfully
Then he took an army
And over the frozen Alps did go
He said I'll conquer Moscow
I'll come back for the bonny bunch of roses, oh 

And so he's took three hundred thousand fighting men
And kings likewise for to join his throng
He was as well provided for
Enough to take the whole world on
But when he came to Moscow
All overpowered by driving snow
And Moscow was a-blazing
And he lost the bonny bunch of roses, oh

My son don't speak so venturesome
For England she has a heart of oak
And England, Ireland and Scotland
Their unity has never been broke
So son think on your father
In St.Helena, his body it lies low
And you will follow after
Beware of the bonny bunch of roses, oh

And it's goodbye to my mother, forever
For I am on my dying bed
Had I lived, I might have been clever
But now I bow my youthful head
And while our bodies do molder
And weeping willows over us do grow
The deeds of brave Napoleon
Will sting the bonny bunch of roses, oh",The Bonny Bunch of Roses,1999

There's an arrow that points to the exit
And a lift that goes no further down, no further down

There's a stage play that shows every evening 
With no prompter, no plot and no lines

On the back seat of a burned out Toyota Camry
She said she'd finally found a way to start a family
But not one soul could conceive that she was on the level 
And the strange thing was she didn't seem to care 
He got what he came for and left her to kiss the air

But the baby burned like bitumen inside her
That inhuman son of a bitch never even called her
The doctor said, 'It'll be some kind of daughter'

Who crawled up to her ear and called her mother
And whispered words of wonder from her other love

Until the hour she screamed out with a vengeance

And shone upon her mother more than anyone

I roamed around from town to town
In search of some employment
It was here I settled down

I saw her standing in the sun
I was bewitched by all her features
And before the day was done
I fell in love with a school teacher
An since she had no next of kin
I offered my assistance
To my surprise she took me in

In a life of such perfection
But winter first appeared
I felt the cold of her rejection
It was then she turned to me

John Wesley Harding,"I started 
Playing guitar by the town memorial
All my songs were singing editorials
And when I'd done, the sermon on the mount
I counted my change and put it in my bank account
I didn't want to work at the local avatar
So I left home, expanded my repertoire
I did some gigs, No one booed
I got free beer and I drank it with gratitude

Once I started I couldn't stop
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top

A businessman with a very young dolly bird
Talked through the set, liked what he thought he heard
Dropped some names he claimed to represent
And asked me if I had any management
Well two weeks later, I'm signing on ??docubine??
Offered some drugs, at first I declined
Lots of parties where the spread's incredible
But don't get close 'cause the food's inedible

And I became a spinning top
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

I got a sweet deal and I moved to America
I fell in love with an heiress called Erica
Started out smart, soon got silly
I partied by the pool and then arrest for necrophilia
News travels fast like electricity
A bad mug shot, it's good publicity
I laid low for a month or two
And spent my dough building a recording studio

And that's when it all went pop
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

The label ??Empeola?? got me in the charts
My new management had me by the private parts
I went on strike, took the initiative
Forgetting that I didn't have a single thing to bargain with
I lost my nerve, my fall was glorious
The lawsuit was eternal and laborious
My new material was only fair to middling
Rome was burning and I did some fiddling

And finally, I was dropped
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

On the way down people tend to leave you where you fall
I tried to stand up but I didn't have the wherewithal
I nearly died in a cab one day
So I swapped my bourbon for a bottle full of perrier
There were rumors about my sexuality
The video star, killed by reality
Next thing I know I'm on my knees
Begging the camera, ""Will you vote me off the island please?""

But the world forgives a flop
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom


O well all that exposure and the phone starts to ring again
I experienced the strange urge to sing again
Well not long ago I was a boy with a dream 
I reacquaint myself with a razor and some shaving cream
Look at me I'm ripe for rediscovery
All I need is Mary to mother me
On the tenth green I was way over par
My partner offered me a tour in ??Jesus Christ's Superstar??

And that's when the penny dropped
That's how I got back back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

Well we toured all over the states of America
I got a picture of my son from Erica
My parents wrote, ""Since you disappeared,
Hard to believe but it's just been one year,""
Now it's back to ale and cakes again
I wonder if I'll make the same mistakes again
I hope that you've enjoyed this tutorial
There's another busker who was playing the memorial

I'm getting bored of talking shop
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom
To the top of the bottom
To the top of the bottom

If I have walked this Earth before 
Why is it I just can't remember 

Feels like I've been here before 
Peered in the window, but never opened the door 
All of my visions fade black 
Now I'm trying to find my way back 

To another life 
In a time when the mysteries were told 
To another life 
In a world full of shadows, behold 
I'm moving soul to soul 
Soul to soul 

And now it fels like I've been here before 
Looked in the window, but never opened the door 
All of my visions have gone black 
Now I'm trying to find my way back 

To another life 
In a time when the mysteries were told 
To another life 
In a world full of shadows, behold 
I'm moving soul to soul

John West,"Smoky mist of dawn, rising slowly from Earth, so warm 
Blood on leaves, glistens like so many jewels 

Death is hereâ?¦ 
One man's victory is another's defeat 
Yet the spirit lives on and on 
Cheating fate once more 
To rise up again 

Warrior Spirit 

Do eyes of the night truly se all? 
Or are lights and shades illusion? 
Moonlight on steel, glistening like a shining star 
Reality or madness? Living in fear 

Death is nearâ?¦ 
One man's victory is another's defeat 
Yet the spirit lives on and on 
Cheating fate once more 
To rise up again, again 

Warrior Spirit, the shadow of the night 
Warrior Spirit, born of darkness, not the light 
Warrior Spirit is a creature of the night 
Warrior Spirit lives on, Warrior Spirit lives on 
On and on, on and on, on and on 

When the spirit cries out, does anyone hear? 
Feel the mountain tremble and the ocean rise 
When the wolf cries out, do you shed a tear? 
As the mountain crumbles right before your eyes 

Your death is here 
One man's victory is another's defeat 
Yet the spirit lives on and on 
Cheating fate once more 
To rise up again, again, again

We could just breathe

Would you mind if I told you
I loved you tonight

It's gonna be alright

I loved you just for tonight

It's gonna be alright (x3)

We've been in love before
Haven't we
But past loves like past lives
It seems to me
We don't have to fear this moment
We could go slow
See where this goes
Cuz you never know
But in the meantime

I hope u know I don't know all of the answers
All I know is what I feel tonight
Your falling into my life
So so
Would you mind if I loved you tonight

We can be one

And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?

You let the sun go down
Too late
You changed direction
Too late

John Wetton,"And now I stand, forsaking pride 
The time has come to turn the tide 
I've drawn the line, I've built my wall 
And I won't let one more dream fall

All days of innocence, I surrendered long ago
Where's the wind that takes me higher 
The hand that offers peace 
The heart that still gives shelter?
I want to go back to find 
The innocent days that I left behind

I still believe they're holding ground 
Behind the Battle Lines
If it takes a million miles over land and sea 
Gonna swim in the rivers of purity 
I know they still run free 
Behind the Battle Lines

One more mountain I must climb 
I've scaled so many in my time 
And if the sun goes down on me 
The light of truth will help me see

All days of innocence, I surrendered long ago

The love that's never ending?

John Wetton,"Here ends another day 
My emotions locked away 
And my darkness is complete as the midnight sky
You steal my confidence 
My smile is my defense 
And I turn my face, so you won't see me cry

How can you be so cold, and so out of control? 
As you pour salt into my deepest cut of all 
My shattered heart, in pieces now 
And I'm gazing at the fragments of my life

Hold me now, maybe just pretend 
I could be someone that you might have loved before 
Hold me now, and let me believe in a kiss that means nothing to you
'Cause it means the world to me

Lord above, you sanctify your love 
And the barrier you built, forces you not to care 
Break down that door, take my hand if nothing more 
So when I'm falling, then I know that someone's there

I wondered a thousand times, if I could love again 
But I will overcome, what I can comprehend
The honesty I offer you 
Is as naked as your fear of loving me

Hold me now, let it never end 
Hold me like you've never done before 
Hold me now, we don't have to pretend 
Smash the chains and throw them to the floor 

Hold me now, and let me believe that a kiss is the way it should be

Looking for paradise, in the heartland 
Looking to everyone, who could be anyone 
Better turn around, turn around

Stand up - with the tree of life
Rise up - in a Sea Of Mercy 
Better gimme some, gimme some, gimme some air

Can bridge a thousand miles?

Try to remember

Open your heart and live again

From this day on you're not the only one

Throw back the shutters and unlock the spell 
Let sunshine light your face 
The growing fears that you know so well 
Will vanish into space

Climbing the face of the unknown

One thing lead to another we were young

To indulge in what they will and jaded thrill or fanstasy

Through those burning teeth
By that lashing tongue

From lungs that are pumping
Sets those vocal discords

Instead of someone's eyes
I get a visual display

Used to be flesh and blood
Right in front of me
Now a picture comes up
On a video screen

Don't you know it's not right
To remain in this silence

I want you to talk to me

An automate on, drive a GTI

And you'll turn on a dime

Yes, I'm glad that I came

Looking for love
With the strength
Of a new day dawning

John Wetton,"She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning,
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win.

She asked me name my foe then. I said the need within some men 
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or god.
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.

But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end.
For she the mother of all men had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay.

""Oh lady lend your hand,"" I cried, ""Oh let me rest here at your side.""
""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life.
There is no strength in numbers. I've no such misconceptions.
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away.

Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.
My labor is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone.
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day.
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise.
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me.",Lady in Black,2003

She's the promise of pearl in a pool of heartache
She's the perfect little truth wrapped in little white lies
Like the wind she will turn
She can state the case now and then
Ignore the truth
When it ain't on her side
When her eyes claim that she's a lady
You better treat her as such
But comfort the little girl when her world gets too rough

If she
If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her
If she's the woman you love

In the moment that your lives touched
There was something in the stars
That made you feel you'd probably die
Just for a good morning in her arms
'Cause you knew you'd seen an angel
And you were sure she'd fly away
But she chose you when she landed
And gave her heart away

So she's your mystery trip into each new tomorrow
She's the first to laugh and she's the worst to cry
She's like the tide 'neath your ship
But all the fall and rise is just a call to dance

And she's always in time
And her love is like a river in a poem
Penned in wine
That takes you floating forever rhyme after rhyme

If she's the woman that you live for

The season for the rodeo is over
And he's usually back home this time of year
But I haven't heard a word since
He called me from Santa Fe
Something in his voice said you were stealing him away

New Mexico - have i lost him to your sunset
Do your mountains life him higher than my love
New Mexico - guess we'll have to wait and see
If tomorrow's gonna bring him back to me

He said he'd never seen a place more beautiful
And he talked of maybe moving there someday
Where the stars in the sky shine like diamonds every night
I wonder if he sees those stars in someone else's eyes

He's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying
He thinks he'll drown all the hurt that he's feeling inside
A river of tears is washing away her every reason for trying
And the distance between them is silence, anger and pride

They don't talk to each other
They're no longer lovers
They won't even say the three words that could keep love from dying
She needs a shoulder, he needs to hold her
But he's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying

He tells the bartender his problems and thanks him for listening
Then he orders more whiskey to have something warm he can hold
She picks up the phone, and calls up a friend, 
And says she wishes she knew what was missing 
Both of them ask the wrong people why their love's growing cold

After all that you've been through
You fell for too many promises, every line
And it was you that always took the fall
I know you're hurtin but don't be sad

One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough

I've done some time on that trail of tears
And I swore I'd never love again so I know what you're going through
I fell in love with a heartbreaker every time

I got over it, so will you
Have a little hope, you've just been through

At making a love that won't unwind

Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
I can't believe your memory didn't keep me awake
My heart's not beating the missing you blues
And my eyes ain't crying for you

All those wasted nights I've sat and cried
Waiting for you knowing that you wouldn't come by
I look back and laugh at the fool I've been
I'll never set foot in them shoes again

I don't mind if I do

I don't jump when the telephone rings
Don't pace the floor, pull my hair and scream
I eat a lot better with an appetite
And sleep comes easy at night

As a matter of fact I never felt so strong
I feel like shouting out I'm over you
I think I'll call my Momma up and tell her the news

It's grown much too fat to recognize
There's a freeway up and the park's torn down
There's not a soul that I know around

Has anybody seen Amy
In her tan bare feet on the summertime street
Can her kiss still turn the winter warm
Or is she just a figment of
What I recall of yesterday's love
Has anybody seen Amy anymore

But there's still a crowd where the boys hang out at night
The songs I hear from those teenage cars
Still got the beat but they've lost the heart

'Cause in '75 something comes alive
Watch the silver cup and the golden rod
Silently listen and it shall be revealed
I was born to fly higher,
	born to stand where I'm standing now
Basking in the light of the neon fire
As it burns my useless body to the ground
Desire let me go
I would fly so high through the sky, never to die
Love has come, Love has come
Inside outside, it shall be revealed
Brilliant stars splash down across a crystal sky
And the moon and the sun and the earth are one
See the shining soul break the ring-pass-not
Spiraling upward and it shall be revealed
The spirit is free
The Universe wants it to be, It calls you and me
Love has come, Love has come
Over under, it shall be revealed
When the bells ring out
And the fire burns within and without
Initiation
When your star grows bright
	and fills all of the world with its light
Unification
Swallow your pride, you don't need it no more
Don't have to hide, all I am is only one more
Standing at the door
	waiting for the world's Initiation
Thunder roar and lightning crack
Snakes of fire dance up and down my back
A long, long road is behind me now
Too late to be afraid of the choice that I have made
But there's one thing I know
Where my spirit says to go,
	you know that's where I must go
When the golden ray
Of the dawn signifies a new day
Initiation
And when loves grows strong
And the spheres join together in song
Unification
Swallow your pride, you don't need it no more
Don't need to hide, all I am is
Only one more, then shut the door
	waiting for the world's Initiation
Over under, it shall be revealed",Initiation,1978
John Wilcox,"It's the last ride
Our little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take you home
And we can't cry 'cause we seen it coming
No use running, take it slower
It's a dangerous drive
I'm afraid to arrive
But I strive to survive
More a fool than alive
I thought I knew just everything
I had it made and I could coast
But I turned away love when I needed it most
It's the last ride
My little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take me home
And I can't cry 'cause I seen it coming
No use running, take it slower
And the road rolls around
And turns through the town
The depression drips down
And glazes the ground
Horizons east and skylines west
The moon, the sun, and all the rest
The loving son, the faithful wife
The burnt out wreck of a poor man's life
The father, son, and holy ghost
They all turned away love when they needed it most

John Wilcox,"No place to hide
And no where to run
Nothing you can do because a change must come

Your head in the ground
Money, money, money makes your world go 'round
You can't stop it
You can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop
You can't stop love in action
You just joined the clan
Your head's full of sand
You need a bunch of friends to make you feel like a man
But you can't stop it
Yeah, you could be the last trace of the master race
The Nazis really send you to another place
Still you can't stop it
You can't stop love in action",Love In Action,1978
John Wilcox,"I've been burned in my prime
The simple things in life
Seem so hard to learn sometimes
And it takes so long
Catch it while you can
Too late tomorrow
And everyone
Said we all know what comes of that
Living in your pockets and talking through your hat
But it won't take long
To turn your head around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man
Turn the world around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone
Everyone is waiting, just anticipating on you
Won't you make a showing everybody knows what to do
Take a dive from your ivory tower
And fall on everyone will catch you, everyone
I would be so pleased to spend some time
To hear a little talk about what's been on your mind
'Cause it don't take long
To turn my head around
If it comes easy

John Wilcox,"I have a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it in your heart

Never never land
It may be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind

And then suddenly you'll find
Never never land
You'll have a treasure if you stay there
More precious far than gold

For once you have found your way there
You will never, never grow old
And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned

Just think of pleasant things
And your heart will fly on wings, forever in

John Wilcox,"Your Daddy runs sheep and my uncle runs cattle
Nothin' can keep us out of this battle they wage
As it burns up the range, 'til no man is left
In the saddle
Your ranch is upstream and they dammed up the water

Thirsty cows scream for my uncle to slaughter
The sheep while yore Daddy's asleep
And I do the same for his daughter
If I had my own way, we would be together

Back in Pittsburgh
It's the only town east of the river I know
And I feel kinda bad, bringin' our grief
Upon this pore old farmer's house

But we ain't got nowhere else to go
Three years on this range since they started the range war
Nothing has changed except maybe change for the worst
If I'd married you first,

There might not have been any range war
You wouldn't be lost to the range war",The Range War,1978
John Wilcox,"When I was a child
I thought as a child
I spoke as a child
I didn't know better

But now I'm a man
I look like a man
I'm old as a man
And I should know better

Got my head in the sky
And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down
And my world is something you can't see

But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man

I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better

And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on

It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now [ha ha ha]

But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong

Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin'
""Oh my God""
There it is - way down inside me
It's a real man

You got to grow up sometime
Be a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows
Be a real man

Now be a real man
Don't sell yourself for nothing
Be a real man
Don't take no crap from no one

Be a real man
Get your trip together
Be a real man",Real Man,1978
John Wilcox,"Sometimes I don't know
I just don't know what to feel

Sometimes I don't know what to feel
Everything I thought that I knew starts to look so unreal
There's a ringing in my head that keeps me awake at night
Sometimes I don't know what is right

Today I saw a car crush my little dog under its wheel
It did not even stop, it just sped off and out of sight
Sometimes I just feel so afraid
But I know that no one else has it made

So if I just believe in myself
I won't need no help from nobody else and I can make it alone
And everything will be cool, I got to keep on keepin' on
There's nothing else I can do

Sometimes I don't know what to do
Someone said the world's going to end and I think its true
I thought there was some love in the world
But I guess I'm wrong

Sometimes I just feel so alone
I don't want to admit to my friends that I feel confused
I wonder what I'd do with myself if the world was gone
Something makes me stay on my feet

Don't you dare admit to defeat
And if I tell myself it's all right
I can comfort myself through the night
And watch another day dawn
And everything will be cool",Sometimes I Don't Know What To Feel,1978
John Wilcox,"Some people tell me that love is a feeling
Or a possession
Somehow it seems so cold
And when they say love is sweet,

Does it mean that you eat it?
Maybe you drink it,

John Wilcox,"Pretty bird with feathers falling
Pretty as a lady calling
For her pink and midnight lover
As she stares into the water

And a yellow moon is rising
And there can't be no disguising
That the pretty bird is dying
With a silver arrow lying at its side

Rivers of blood,
Oceans of tears,
Life without death,
And death without reason

To the whole United Nations,
To your greatest expectations
To the moment that you realize
As a dark figure slips from out of the shadow

Pretty bird closes its eyes, pretty bird dies
Another pretty thing dead on the end of the shaft
Of the Zen Archer

A man in parts forgotten
With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it
Finds relief inside a hatchet
And he halved someone in Boulder
Justifiability is in the hands of the beholder
And you just don't know what people will do next

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,
Death without life,
And life without meaning

To the love that's never spoken
Just as surely as I'm in your ears

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Though I longed for him, another trusted me completely so I never could be free.

And so I came to see him to listen for a while.

I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.

Footsteps that you hear down the hall

Where ancient mountains are whittled down

Millions of years to a little mound

Where giant feet are fossil found

I see spinifex surfing on a dune,

The rock is redder in the afternoon

Tourists clicking madly soon


Where spring will come with any rain

A chance to flower and seed again

Forever garden risin' plain

The dangers of the wild remain


And away up there where the wind is blown

Never before felt so alone

More aware of skin and bone

I watch the parade of human folk

Strips of rubber, cans of Coke

Making dust and blowing smoke


Where the awe-inspiring power of time

Leave some fearful, some sublime

White man finds his progress prime

Black man feels no urge to climb


Now I believe we all are one

Features and creatures in the sun

Breathing the air we all belong

I have a dream I can't explain

Wattle soldiers, making claim

And paradise returns again

'Cause that's where I get my music
And that's where I live my life
You can call me a jolly swagman if you like

Call it humpin' my bluey,I reckon that's the style
So why don't you climb aboard with me, along the road a while

Been workin' in the big smoke, singin' at the pub
I talk to people everywhere - they still love the scrub
Longing for a piece of land and the Eucalyptus air
So why don't you come with me, I'll take you there

Maybe we'll find a shack somewhere
Plant an avocado tree
With fences only to deep out the cows
Share a dream with me

I've spent some time in your town, at every waterhole
'Cause I must drink a big brown land to quench a thirsty soul
From W.A along the Nullabor and north to the black soil plains
Through cattle, sheep and hills of golden grain
The snow on Kosciusko
My friends in the Territory
Springtime in Tasmania, it all belongs to me",Humpin' My Bluey,2006

Real country people in their prime,

Livin' in New South on Queensland time

He's a stockman, likes raisin' sheep,

Likes raisin' children, don't get much sleep

On the shady big verandah, with his hardworking wife,

Three young sidekicks,

It's a way of life.


Some years they make it, some years they don't

Sometimes the creek flows, sometimes it won't

Sometimes he's mean, he's got a gun

When the ewes are lambing he's got pigs on the run

Out in the lignum, on the water course

You could lose a pig dog, you could lose a horse.


Think you oughta know the channel's coming through

Wipin' out the bushland and the kangaroo

Greedy men with water rights to neutralise the land

When's it gonna stop I just don't understand.

With cotton in their ears and dollars in their eyes

Their banker grins and our country dies.


They love the bush, they grow the wool

They respect the land and it's beautiful

Blue Bonnets, Leatherheads and Red-Back Wrens

Bower Birds, Ring Necks and Water Hens

Red Wings and Red Tailed Black Cockatoos Think of all the rainbows we could lose


Real country people in their prime

Livin' in New South on Queensland time

He's a stockman likes raisin' sheep,

Likes raisin' children, don't get much sleep

It's a way of life.

Koala Koala - we love you

But we chop down your home

And you run

Koala, Koala - where do you go

When we take your gum tree away


Please don't run on the road

And please don't cry

Help is on its way

We're gonna learn what makes you die

Gonna send in some money today


You can't dig a hole

Or live in a roof

Or hang from a big, fig tree

If I plant you a special Eucalypt

Will you come and live with me


Koalas they used to be everywhere

What a paradise it could be

A walk in the bush could be heaven

Bring the dreamtime back to me


Yeah, we're going to learn what makes you die

Gonna send in some money today

Against hostile seeking eyes
and the waves wipe out my footprints in the sand.

When you see me falling will you be there

Now I can't fly but I'm tellin' you, I can run the pants off a kangaroo
He can't fly but I'm tellin' you, he can run the pants off a kangaroo

If you take a look it'll prove to you (ha-ha-ha-ha), I ran the pants off that kangaroo
Take a look, it'll prove to you, he ran the pants off the kangaroo

You can't loop the loop like a cockatoo 
Swoop and toss like an albatross
You silly gallah, I'm better by far, than a white cockatoo or a budgerigar
They squeak and squawk and try to talk, why me and them's like cheese and chalk
He can't fly but I'm tellin' you, he can run the pants off a kangaroo

And I'll go forward like a steel machine

Humbled by the truth I am
A Golden Wallaby

And I will seize the day
'Cause it belongs to me
I have a number on my back
I am a Wallaby.

And if the ball won't roll my way
No matter how I try that day
I won't let my temper fray
I'll fight on 'til the end

And I will keep a solid chin
'Cause champions don't always win
They're known for coming back again
And we will make amends.

Livin' in New South on Queensland time

He's a stockman, likes raisin' sheep,

Likes raisin' children, don't get much sleep

On the shady big verandah, with his hardworking wife,

Three young sidekicks,

It's a way of life.


Some years they make it, some years they don't

Sometimes the creek flows, sometimes it won't

Sometimes he's mean, he's got a gun

When the ewes are lambing he's got pigs on the run

Out in the lignum, on the water course

You could lose a pig dog, you could lose a horse.


Think you oughta know the channel's coming through

Wipin' out the bushland and the kangaroo

Greedy men with water rights to neutralise the land

When's it gonna stop I just don't understand.

With cotton in their ears and dollars in their eyes

Their banker grins and our country dies.


They love the bush, they grow the wool

They respect the land and it's beautiful

Blue Bonnets, Leatherheads and Red-Back Wrens

Bower Birds, Ring Necks and Water Hens

Red Wings and Red Tailed Black Cockatoos Think of all the rainbows we could lose

It was a long march from cadets
The sixth battalion was next to tour, it was me who drew the card
We did Canungra, Shoalwater, before we left

And Townsville lined the footpaths as we marched down to the quay
This clipping from the paper shows a youngon', strong and clean
And there's me with me slouch hat, my SLR and greens

From Vung Tau riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
We made our tents a home, V.B. and pinups on the lockers
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub

And can you tell me, doctor, why I can't get to sleep? 
And night time's just a jungle dark and a barking M.16? 
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me - I was only nineteen

A four week operation, any step could be your last one on two legs
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off

Then someone yelled out ""Contact"", and the bloke behind me swore

Koala Koala - we love you

But we chop down your home

And you run

Koala, Koala - where do you go

When we take your gum tree away


Please don't run on the road

And please don't cry

Help is on its way

We're gonna learn what makes you die

Gonna send in some money today


You can't dig a hole

Or live in a roof

Or hang from a big, fig tree

If I plant you a special Eucalypt

Will you come and live with me


Koalas they used to be everywhere

What a paradise it could be

A walk in the bush could be heaven

Bring the dreamtime back to me


Yeah, we're going to learn what makes you die

Gonna send in some money today

I've been around the world

A couple of times or maybe more

I've seen the sights, I've had delights

On every foreign shore

But when my mates all ask me

The place that I adore

I tell them right away


Give me a home among the gumtrees

With lots of plum trees

A sheep or two, a k-kangaroo

A clothesline out the back

Verandah out the front

And an old rocking chair


You can see me in the kitchen

Cooking up a roast

Or Vegemite on toast

Just you and me, a cup of tea

And later on, we'll settle down

And go out on the porch

And watch the possums play


There's a Safeways up the corner

And a Woolies down the street

And a brand new place they've opened up

Where they regulate the heat

But I'd trade them all tomorrow

For a little bush retreat

Where the kookaburras call


Some people like their houses

With fences all around

Others live in mansions

And some beneath the ground

But me I like the bush you know

With rabbits running round

And a pumpkin vine out the back

His name was Bill
He caught our budgie on the window sill
One holy day, one Sunday morn
Left only feathers on our back lawn
Oh no Bill, you can't do that
You silly pussy, you stupid cat
So we took him down, our family pet
And we left his balls with the family vet

Well the very next day he packed his bags
Left all his penthouse and playboy mags
How could we do it to the family vet
Go and leave his balls with the family vet
Well we get no postcards, no telephone calls
He's out in the bush somewhere, with no balls
And he's obsessed with sweet revenge
So he eats our parrots and our fairy wrens

Yes he's mortified and we all regret 
That we Left his balls with the family vet


How he's highly sought by the feral choir 
For his new found talent to sing much higher

When the little blighter only cost me five.
The veterinary surgeon saw me coming,
But I had to keep my feathered friend alive;

He was shaking on his perch, the kids were crying,
The family gathered round his little cage.
I said I think it's time we got a new one,
That's when the family went into a rage.
	
Oh, the waiting room ponged like a rat house,
With heart worms and lung worms and lice.
And a Persian had her eye on the shoebox,
I suppose she thought our budgie might be nice.

Well the bird shit on the veterinary surgeon,
I heard him say the dirty little chick.
Guess he wondered why I didn't use my brains
And hit him over the head with a brick.

Oh antibiotics for his color,
Two drops a day on his beak.
Some powder on the nose for his feathers
And clean out his cage twice a week.

Well it cost me thirty bucks to fix my budgie
When the little blighter only cost me five
And the bludger wakes me early in the morning,
It's got me puzzled how he survives.

One night I'll feed him to the tom cat.
Instead of worrying about him when we go away.

When everyone's on holiday.

Where did Mum and Dad go?
I wish someone would hurry up and come and get me,

Cracker night was a real big deal, when I was a little kid
They started lettin' them off after tea I ran inside and hid
And all the dogs from everywhere were underneath me bed.

We all went down in our dressing gowns to see the big bonfire
Wide eyes watched the straw man burn on a mile-high pile of tires
Hot as hell, big black smell and red hot rings of wire.

Sky rockets zinging,
Catherine wheels spinning,
What a flamin' evening,
Fire trucks were screaming
Smoky haze hangin' round for days
And Grandma's ears were ringing.

Every night after school draggin' bits of wood,
Boxes and branches and rotten old fences,
And mattresses were good.
We even scrounged a vinyl lounge
And anything we could

Little Guy Fawkes's and letter boxes
Blown all out of shape
Light the wick and back off quick,
And make the big escape
Cackin' ourselves and rippin' my shirt
Scrambling through the gate

What a flamin' evening
Fire trucks were screaming
Smoky haze hangin' round for days
And Grandma's ears were ringing.

This thing whizzed across the road
And nearly hit our car
A bang and spark lit up the park

John Williamson,"This guitar only sings the way I play it
It's a part of me just like another arm
It started out as a little ukulele
When I was just a boy on the farm

My fingers were too lazy for piano
But I could hold a tune pretty good
And I couldn't sing a song with a trombone
So I taught myself to play this piece of wood

But I know you are stayin' beside me
True lovers, we both feel the pain
And I'd throw this old box on the fire
Before I'd ever lose you again

Well you never did like this old guitar, did you darlin'
Cause the guitar takes your man away from you
Monday I'll write a song for you darlin'
That'll be the very best that I can do

Will it be a song about a wild wind
Will the thunder clap and flashes of blue
Or will it be a song about an angel
It'll never be as beautiful as you

But I know you are stayin' beside me
True lovers, we both feel the pain
And I'd throw this old box on the fire
Before I'd ever lose you again

This guitar only sings the way I play it
It's a part of me just like another arm
It started out as a little ukulele
When I was just a boy on the farm

Broken hearts, me and you
After all of this time
I'm satisfied inside to know

This memory that I had
It's more good than bad
You taught me how to sing
And bring you love

After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all

Our love didn't last long
What went wrong?
Who's to say?

If you never been by
How then could I
Begin to say

by John Williamson


Where ancient mountains are whittled down

Millions of years to a little mound

Where giant feet are fossil found

I see spinifex surfing on a dune,

The rock is redder in the afternoon

Tourists clicking madly soon


Where spring will come with any rain

A chance to flower and seed again

Forever garden risin' plain

The dangers of the wild remain


And away up there where the wind is blown

Never before felt so alone

More aware of skin and bone

I watch the parade of human folk

Strips of rubber, cans of Coke

Making dust and blowing smoke


Where the awe-inspiring power of time

Leave some fearful, some sublime

White man finds his progress prime

Black man feels no urge to climb


Now I believe we all are one

Features and creatures in the sun

Breathing the air we all belong

I have a dream I can't explain

Wattle soldiers, making claim

And paradise returns again

I'll give you a gentle push

And that's where I live my life
You can call me a jolly swagman if you like

Call it humpin' my bluey,I reckon that's the style
So why don't you climb aboard with me, along the road a while

Been workin' in the big smoke, singin' at the pub
I talk to people everywhere - they still love the scrub
Longing for a piece of land and the Eucalyptus air
So why don't you come with me, I'll take you there

Maybe we'll find a shack somewhere
Plant an avocado tree
With fences only to deep out the cows
Share a dream with me

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy

Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine

They just placed a marble stand in front of it

I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time

John Willis,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999

But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill

John Willis,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Your eyes like an ocean of clear sunlit green
My eyes with the salt water
Wash me clean....again

And just imagine you whispered a secret that could take away my blues
And you let me believe it to please me, though it just wasn't true
You just meant to share with me pleasure
And your gifted at what you do
But your speaking an unspoken language
I thought that you knew
It's one that we all learn by heart
And our hearts think its true

",Language of the Heart,2001
John Wright,"You say you see no hope
You say you see no reason we should dream
That the world would ever change
You say the love is foolish to believe
'Cause they'll always be some crazy
With an army or a knife
To wake you from your daydream
Put the fear back in your life

Look
If someone wrote a play
To just to glorify what's stronger than hate
Would they not arrange the stage
To look as if the hero came too late?
He's almost in defeat
It's looking like the evil side will when
So on the edge of every seat
From the moment that the whole thing begins

It is love who mixed the mortar
And it's love who stacked these stones
And it's love who made the stage here
Although it looks like we're alone
In this scene, set in shadows,
Like the night is here to stay
There is evil cast around us
But it's love that wrote the play
For in this darkness love can show the way

Now the stage is set
You can feel your own heart beating in your chest
This life's not over yet
So we get up on our feet and do our best
We play against the fear
We play against the reasons not to try
We're playing for the tears
Burning in the happy angel's eyes

For it's love who mixed the mortar
And it's love who stacked these stones
And it's love who made the stage here
Though it looks like we're alone
In this scene, set in shadows,
Like the night is here to stay
There is evil cast around us
But it's love that wrote the play
For in this darkness love will show the way",Show the Way,2001
John Wright,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1961
John Wright,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

I'd never let you go,

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2009

Said his name was paradise
Didn't realise at the time
That his face and mind were mine

That I should dig him on the night
But in the morning with the sun he pulled an automatic gun
He blew my soul, he blew my brain
He said I could not do the same

Chop him up and burn the wood.

Johnnie Allan,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Johnnie Allan,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound
And rode into Raleigh
And on across Caroline

We had motor trouble that turn into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
And that hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away I brought me a through train ticket
Ridin' across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just to help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born brought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Alburquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Working on a T-bone steak a la carte 
Flying over to the golden state
Ah when the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate

Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon river and they found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome
Sam crossed the Majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteen-one

Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on

George turns to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home

Johnnie Allan,"Cry, cry
Sitting home alone, thinkin' about my past
Wonderin' how I made it, and how long it's gonna last
Success has come to lots of them, and failure's always there
Time, time waits for no one and I wish, how I wish someone would care

Some folks think you're happy, when you wear your smile
What about your tribulations, and all, all of your trials
Smiles, smiles hide a lots a things
The good, the bad, the hurt, all of this goes too
And I wish, how I wish, how I wish someone would care
I wish someone would care
Don't you think someone should care?
Ah don't you think someone should care?
Sit down and think about yourself
Ah don't you think someone should care?
Mm, don't you think someone should care?
Ah don't you think someone should care?",Wish Someone Would Care,1996
Johnnie Allan,"If I
Had wings
Like an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay
'Til I die

Take my wife
My child
And your own mother
We would just
Sit and sleep
Each day
It's alone and so lonely
In this prison
But for wrongs
I have done
I must pay

You know I'm lost
Like a ship
On the ocean
That has lost
All its crew
In a gale
I got drunk
And I shot
My best buddy
.
Now I must
Spend my life in jail

Though if I
Had the wings of an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay

Johnnie Dollar,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1999

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1996

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1996

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Back in New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin 
Made of earth and wood
Where lived a hillbilly boy
Named Johnny B. Goode

To read or write so well
But he could rock n' roll 
Like a bat out of hell
Go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go

He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
He sit down by the tree
By the railroad track
The engineer could see him 
Sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
They would stop and say
My that St. Louie boy can play
Go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go

Rock and roll music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me

I've have no kick against modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sound just like a symphony,

That's why I go for that

Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me

So she can hear my man awailin' sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were blowing like a hurricane

Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it

If you want to dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee,
The jokey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup,
The folks dancin' got all shook up

Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it

If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo;
It's way to early for the congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2001

Johnnie Lee Wills,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,1978
Johnnie Miller,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet
Goodbye",Body and Soul [Excerpt],1991

You're always on my mind although we are apart
You're always, you're always, always on my mind

And baby, the reason why I know I can't forget your face
'Cause everywhere I go, I see you every place
You're always, you're always, always on my mind

Life is so empty alone with a broken heart
Please, please tell me
Honey, why, why did we have to part, oh?

Gee but its great after staying out late
Walking my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walking my baby back home

Or I'm reciting a poem
The hours go by and they gave me the eye
Walking my baby back home

And we stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And cuddles her cheek to my chest
And we start in to pet and that's when I get
Her powder all over my vest

And just when I try to straighten my tie
She wants to borrow my comb

We could save about a mile

And the moonlight weaves a spell
We can take the road among the daisies

Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried

And no one cared if he lived or died
And said sometimes the thunder and lightning
Make all little clouds hide

He said ""Have faith in all kinds of weather""
""For the sun will always shine""
""Do your best and always remember""
""The dark clouds pass with time""

And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry",Cry (Theme),2002
Johnnie Ray,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

W e may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
Can't take that away
Can't take that away from me",They Can't Take That Away from Me,2002

Johnnie Ray,"There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral
Seems there is someone at my side

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars",Empty Saddles,2002

We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened our pathways awhile

Come and sit by my side, if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

I've been thinking a long time, my darling
Of the sweet words you never would say
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish
For they say you are going away

Do you think of the valley you're leaving
O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

Come and sit by my side, if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

They will bury me where you have wandered
Near the hills where the daffodils grow
When you're gone from the Red River Valley
For I can't live without you I know

Come and sit by my side, if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

Notice that we're coming to the crossroads
Should we turn to left or right?
Mother is a-rockin' and a-waitin'
But it's such a lovely night

We could save about a mile
And now and then the short road can be longer
If you linger for a while

And the moonlight weaves a spell
We can take the road among the daisies
You know daisies never tell

Little ol' words like 'I love you'
Everything you say is so convincing
Yes, that's what we ought to do
