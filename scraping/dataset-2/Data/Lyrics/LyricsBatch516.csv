Julie Andrews,"I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
Tell me please, where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreamin' of?

It'll be goodbye, I know,
To my tale of woe
When he says hello, so;
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.

If it's true that love affairs are all arranged in heaven,
My guardian angel's holding out on me!
So I'm looking for a boy 'bout five foot six or seven,
And won't be happy till I'm on his knee!
I'll be blue until he comes my way,
Hope he takes the cue when I am sayin';

Tell me please, where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreamin' of?

It'll be goodbye, I know,
To my tale of woe
When he says hello, so;
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
Won't you find that boy?
Help me find a boy
Who's lookin' for a girl to love.",Looking for a Boy,2001
Julie Andrews,"I'm in a nice bit of trouble, I confess;
Somebody with me has had a game.
I should by now be a proud and happy bride,
But I've still got to keep my single name.
I was proposed to by Obadiah Binks
In a very gentlemanly way;
Lent him all my money so that he could buy a home,
And punctually at twelve o'clock to-day-

There was I, waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church;
When I found he'd left me in the lurch,
Lor, how it did upset me!
All at once, he sent me round a note
Here's the very note,
This is what he wrote:
""Can't get away to marry you today,
My wife, won't let me!""

Lor, what a fuss Obadiah made of me
When he used to take me in the park!
He used to squeeze me till I was black and blue,
When he kissed me he used to leave a mark.
Each time he met me he treated me to port,
Took me now and then to see the play;
Understand me rightly, when I say he treated me,
It wasn't him but me that used to pay.

There was I, waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church;
When I found he'd left me in the lurch,
Lor, how it did upset me!
All at once, he sent me round a note
Here's the very note,
This is what he wrote:
""Can't get away to marry you today,
My wife, won't let me!""

Just think how disappointed I must feel,
I'll be off me crumpet very soon.
I've lost my husband, the one I never had!
And I dreamed so about the honeymoon.
I'm looking out for another Obadiah,
I've already bought the wedding ring,
There's all my little fal-de-riddles packed up in my box
Yes, absolutely two of ev'rything.

There was I, waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church;
When I found he'd left me in the lurch,
Lor, how it did upset me!
All at once, he sent me round a note
Here's the very note,
This is what he wrote:
""Can't get away to marry you today,
My wife, won't let me!""",Waiting at the Church (My Wife Won't Let Me),2001
Julie Andrews,"When the skies are brighter canary yellow
I forget ev'ry cloud I've ever seen,
So they called me a cockeyed optimist
Immature and incurably green.

I have heard people rant and rave and bellow
That we're done and we might as well be dead,
But I'm only a cockeyed optimist
And I can't get it into my head.

I hear the human race
Is fallin' on its face
And hasn't very far to go,
But ev'ry whippoorwill
Is sellin' me a bill,
And tellin' me it just ain't so.

I could say life is just a bowl of Jello
And appear more intelligent and smart,
But I'm stuck like a dope
With a thing called hope,
And I can't get it out of my heart!
Not this heart",A  Cock-Eyed Optimist [From South Pacific],2001
Julie Andrews,"It's a very ancient saying

On the subject I like most

Julie Andrews,"When I think of Tom
I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
was sleeping on a hill

I remember this
And I always will
There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own","Hello Young Lovers, song (from ""The King and I"") [From The King and I]",2001

Julie Andrews,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture (Excerpt) [From My Fair Lady],2001

It's not the Christmas card you've sent for years
Not the joyful sound when sleigh bells ring
Or the merry songs children sing

The little gift you send on Christmas day
Will not bring back the friend you turned away
So may I suggest the secret of Christmas
It's not the things you do at Christmas time
But the Christmas things you do all year through

'Bout twenty years ago way down in New Orleans,
A group of fellers found a new kind of music
And they decided to call it, jazz,
No other sound has what this music has.

Before they knew it, it was whizzin' 'round the world,
The world was ready for a blue kind of music
And now they play it from Steamboat Springs to La Paz.
Oh, baby, won't you play me
""Le Jazz Hot"" maybe
And don't ever let it end.

I tell ya, friends, it's really something to hear,
I can't sit still when there's that rhythm near me.
Also, baby, ""Le Jazz Hot"" may be
What's holdin' my soul together.
Don't know whether it's morning or night,
Only know it's sounding right.
So come on in an' play me
""Le Jazz Hot"", baby,
'Cause I love my Jazz,
Hot!

Some girls are fair
Some are jolly and fit
Some have a well-bred air
Or a well-wholed wit

Each one's a jewel
With a singular shine
A work of art
With it's own rare design

Dear little girl,
You are terribly blessed
But it's your heart of gold
I love the best

And that will be your crowning glory
Your whole life through
It'll always be your crowning glory
The most glorious part of you

Some boys can waltz
Some guys can groove
Strike an elegant pose
With the really good clothes
Some seem to have no faults
But we never like those
No we don't
He'll praise your eyes
Your melodious laugh
Call you more lovely than others by half
The one who's right
My gorgeous prince
Will be honest and true
He'll believe in me too
And prize your heart of gold the way I do

He'll know that will be your crowning glory your whole life through
Your love will see that it's your crowning glory
The most glorious part of you and you
And you
And you

Julie Andrews,"Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Well next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue?

The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

Oh man this is really living
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard

And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true

Their nests are so bare

Julie Andrews,"Well after all, Pickering,
I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance,
to live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
doing whatever he thinks is best, for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...

BUT, Let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through,
she'll redecorate your home,
from the cellar to the dome,
and then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...

Let a woman in your life,
and you're up against a wall,
make a plan and you will find,
that she has something else in mind,
and so rather than do either you do something else that neither likes at all

You want to talk of Keats and Milton, she only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life and you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let
a woman in my life,

I'm a very gentle man, even tempered and good natured who you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
the sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips
Very gentle man...

But, Let a woman in your life, and patience hasn't got a chance,
she will beg you for advice,
your reply will be concise, and she will listen very nicely,
and then go out and do exactly what she wants!!!

You are a man of grace and polish, who never spoke above a hush,
all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a
woman in my life

I'm a quiet living man,
who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room,
who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys,
who likes to meditate, contemplate, far for humanities mad inhuman noise,
Quiet living man....

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through,
in a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with YOU!,
she'll have a booming boisterous family,
who will descend on you en mass,
she'll have a large Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass,

And content before we met.

Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Julie Andrews,"There´s a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye
Goodbye!
I´m glad to go, I cannot tell a lie
I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly
The sun has gone to bed and so must I

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye!","So Long, Farewell (Reprise)",2018
Julie Anne,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

From a lonely wooden tower

Yes, and when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, all men will be sailors then
Until the seas free them

There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Julie Covington,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me

(All:)
A new Argentina, a new age about to begin
A new Argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

(Eva:)
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the Big Apple

But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country

(Eva:)
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(All:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied

(Che:)
How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause
The inconvenience, having to get a majority
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause
There are other ways of establishing authority

Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?

Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're our savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

[Eva:]
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don't care what the bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them
But to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

There is evil, ever around

Quite incidental

[Eva:]
So what are my chances of honest advances?
I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo

[Che:]
Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?

[Eva:]
Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
And mark your adieu with three cheers
But first tell me who'd be delighted
If I said I'd take on the world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I lived for one hundred years

[Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental

So go, if you're able, to somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear
Is that clear, dear?

But the physical interferes
Every day more, oh my Creator

Julie Doiron,"Turn out the light and close your eyes and hold me next to you
Dream of my smile, sounds of my voice and feel my blood rush through
My arms and my legs, my hands and my toes, my feet, my fingers, too.
I'll tell you softly as you fall asleep I'll only dream of you.

Lazy and hazy, tired and confused but still my thought is clear
So much time will pass on from now and still I will be here
Laughing and talking and yelling and crying and dreaming I am with 
You
I'll tell you softly as you fall asleep I'll only dream of you.
I'll tell you again as I fall asleep I'll only dream of you.

You look good these days
Talking's not so easy

Julie Doiron,"It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till  you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard,  it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next?  then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you want to get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the are's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

And nurse them to life with their heads on our breast
And those that were brave, but who didn't survive

And know that it's true cause we won't know of lies.
We'll have no need of dope, nothing left to escape from
Turned on by life is the best kind of ""high""

We'll drink from streams of cool clear water
That won't stain our lips with the blood of the dead
We won?t see it dripping red through our fingers
In pools on the ground where the bodies have bled.

And we'll open the door and our hearts will be warm
And things will look good when our new day is born

And just turn away from the dirt in our eye
Cause the young is the new, and the old is the withered
And those that last longest will win by and by

We'll never look back once we reach where we're going
And our road will take us where we want to be

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories

With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

Oh, oh, oh
I was scared and you held me tight
Oh, ohhh

It was like we were in black and white
As clear as day, as dark as night

And the truth became a lie
Oh, ohhh
There was no longer peace of mind
Just fear of the unknown, and the unkind

And then when he undressed me
And took my body
I was resolute to be fine

Now the soldiers are all on fire
And our hearts, are dead from desire

And when you say it has nothing to do
Nothing to do with you, you're a liar

Of those we loved and those we lost

Make it stronger

guiding us home wherever we are

This love it is a burning sun
shining a light on the things that we've done

but each word we spoke the wind blew away

Could these walls come crumbling down?
I want to feel my feet on the ground
And leave behind this prison we share
Step into the open air

How did we let it come to this?
What we've just tasted we somehow still miss

How will it feel when this day is done?
And can we keep what we've only begun?

And now these walls come crumbling down

Julie Fowlis,"Well I know it ain't been roses lately, baby, it's just been thorns
And no matter what we do, nothing seems to change
Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

All them uh and them uh
And them uh, uh, uh
Ain't gonna spell success

Is so much more then demurer
Than all them other ladies because
You gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get applause

Do something special
Anything special
Do something special

You're more than just a mimic
When you got a gimmick
Take a look how different we are

If you wanna make it
Twinkle while you shake it
If you wanna grind it
Wait till you refined it

If you wanna pump it
Pump it with a trumpet
Get yourself a gimmick
And you too can be a star

The gates of Hea-ven.

To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do

Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...

I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day !
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers 
But if there's some emergency 
Have a male friend to ask for me 
So then she won't peep its really you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
I've got something that I must tell 
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
And it was not you my part-time lover 
And then a man called our exchange 
But didn't want to leave his name 
I guess that two can play the game 
Of part-time lovers 
You and me, part-time lovers 
But, she and he, part-time lovers

Julie Kelly,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Oh and yes His peace will come in and rescue
Don't you know His blood will cleanse you and save you
If you will open up your ears and open up
Your heart and listen

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a hammer ringing, ringing through the land
Would you listen, would you listen
To a cruel, cruel message
Crucify the man
People listen, listen
'Cause His blood is falling in the sand

When the baby cried we closed our ears to wisdom
When the word was preached we closed our minds to love
And when the hammer rang we closed our hearts to Jesus

Open up your mind and open up your soul

I'm addicted to your charms;
You're getting to be a habit with me.
I used to think your love was something that I
Could take or leave alone.
But now I couldn't do without my supply,
I need you for my own.
Oh, I can't break away,
I must have you ev'ry day,
As regularly as coffee or tea.
You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free,
You're getting to be a habit with me,
(Can't break it!)
You're getting to be a habit with me.

I thought it was just another meeting,
But my fate had begun;
Something in my heart kept on repeating,
She's diff'rent, this one.
I'm getting, oh so used to having you around each day,
Don't you ever go away.

Julie London,"See that train coming round the bend,
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth,
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul,
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as blue as the sea,
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose,
And she promised she would always love me

The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground

The stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in Maytime
Would sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
The rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me
No winds of winter would blow

I gave you my love
And I was living a dream
But living would seem in vain

Julie London,"Since I went on the wagon, I'm certain drink is a major crime
For when you lay off the liquor, you feel so much slicker
Well that is, most of the time
But there are moments, sooner or later
When it's tough, I got to say, love to say ... Waiter

Make it another old-fashioned, please
Make it another, double, old-fashioned, please
Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew
Make it for one of love's new refugees

Once high in my castle, I ran to you
And oh what a castle, built on a heavenly dream
Then quick as a lightning flash, that castle began to crash
So, make it another old-fashioned, please

Leave out the orange, 
Leave out the bitters
Just make it straight, right","Make It Another Old-Fashioned, Please",1962

Remind me that the world is full of men
When I start to miss you, to touch your hand, to kiss you
Remind me to count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

Not to mention that I love you

To be sorry that we met
Although I adore you, remind me to ignore you

Julie London,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
... tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most,1962
Julie London,"All she has to do is say ""Hello""
And that's the sweetest melody I know
The sound of angels singing soft and low
When she makes music

Her laughter is an echo in the breeze
That hushes larks and thrushes in the trees
And calms the wave that rushes from the seas
When she makes music

Any time she breathes a sigh
The symphony begins
Every time she says ""Goodbye""
A million violins start crying

The song is sad until we meet again
We kiss and then the song is sweet again
But whether she is far away or very near
She makes music only I can hear.

Told me you were through with me and

For when you lay off the liquor, you feel so much slicker

But there are moments, sooner or later
When it's tough, I got to say, love to say, waiter

Make it another old-fashioned, please
Make it another, double, old-fashioned, please
Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew
Make it for one of love's new refugees

Once high in my castle, I ran to you
And oh what a castle, built on a heavenly dream
Then quick as a lightning flash, that castle began to crash
So, make it another old-fashioned, please

Leave out the orange, 
Leave out the bitters

Nobody works on easy street
Just lie around all day, just sit and play the horses

Life is sweet for folks who live on easy street

That makes your hair turn gray

When opportunity comes knockin'
You just keep on with your rockin'
'Cause you know your fortune's made

And if the sun makes you perspire
There's a man that you can hire
To plant trees so you can have shade

On easy street, I'm telling everyone I meet
If I could live on easy street I'd want no job today
So please, go 'way

Julie London,"Love, like red wine, must have time to age.
It mellows in flavor with each passing stage.
But even the best of the vinege (vine) goes bad.
And whether it's wine or love, that?s sad.
I won't answer love the next time it knocks.

Some bitters for crying, long unhappy nights.
A dash of lost dreams, then stir with regret.
Shake well, and pour, then drink and forget.

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2004
Julie Lyon,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,2007

Et n’a pas de problèmes
À se faire des amis
Quand il a besoin d’ivresse
Il se paie des maîtresses

Il se sent propriétaire…

Ont tout et sans efforts
Sans peine et misère

Y’a une vague d’amour qui danse
Qui balance
Plus rien à comprendre

L’Amérique qui balance
Et casse tout au son des guitares
Au vent des speakers
Comme des outsiders
Dans leurs bottes de rockers

À g’noux sur les planches
Les bras ouverts vers la folie
Ils vont nous faire un malheur
Comme une flèche au cœur

Lumière bleue des projecteurs

Dans un coup de couleur
Un coup de douleur

Julie Mathews,"Have you seen the old man in the closed down market
Picking up the papers with his worn out shoes
In his eyes you see no pride and hanging loosely at his side
Yesterdays paper, telling yesterdays news
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old dear who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home, in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

And in the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
And each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone
So how can you tell me that you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
And in the winter city, the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero, and a World that doesn't care
So how can you tell me that you're lonely

Julie Matthews,"When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon
I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
Now I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends
I have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

And I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

Julie McConnell,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Julie McKnight,"After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room

Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to

See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believe in my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searchin' trying to figure out
When hell stops and heaven begins

The rebels they shot and shelled,
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks,
And guarded them as they fell.
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain,
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again.

But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair.
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there.

Who knows where, who knows when
On some morning without number
On some highway without end
Don't grasp my hand and say
Fate has brought us here today
Oh, fate is only fooling with us friend

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all

It's a desperate game we play
Throw our souls, our lives away
On wounds that can't be mended
And debts that can't be paid
Well I played and I got stung
Now I'm biting back my tongue
And sweeping out the footprints where I strayed

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all

If it is then let me do my time
Lock my heart up, throw away the key
I'm a prisoner that don't wanna go free

Come on baby, kill me with a kiss
Come on make me, die of happiness

I know whiskey makes a man a fool
But darlin' whiskey ain't got nothing on you

Tell the doctor, he ain't got no cure
I'm a goner baby, that's for sure
Tell the lawman he ain't got no gun
That could hurt me like the way you've done

Come on baby, kill me with a kiss

Julie Miller,"Seventeen years, how could we know?
And thirteen years to make a flower grow
Tears that fell from your eyes
Were the one's heaven cries
For the children left to walk alone

There is a light, no one can take
There is a chain of love no one can break
In all the world there is
No love greater than this
To lay down your life for your friends

And did you feel the longing?
And did you hear a secret song?
And did you sing it out to the dark?
Did you follow the footsteps?
Did you shine a light and did
You dance with all of your heart?

And did you feel the longing?
And did you hear a secret song?
Did you sing it out to the dark?
Did you follow the footsteps?
Did you shine a light and did

Upon you, the angels all have smiled

Julie Miller,"I got a hole in my pocket
I got a tear in my heart
I got a door I can't unlock it
I live on shadows in the dark

I hear the sound of a heartbeat
I hear a secret in the rain
It's like a kiss of a lover
It's like a stranger knows your name

I'm gonna rock on the water
And dance on the flood
I'm gonna lay down with the wind
Lay down and believe like a child
I feel the swell of the tempest
I can feel the passion of a soul
Like there's a storm comin' in
I can feel the storm going wild

And when the thunderheads starts beating like a drum
And the thunder cracks the sky in two
The wind is gonna blow and the rain is gonna come
And the river's gonna run

I wanna walk on a wire
I wanna walk an unbroken line
I wanna live when I die
And shake my soul loose from time
I wanna ride with the angels
On that invisible street
And leave my footprints in the sky
And feel the stars beneath my feet

And when the thunderheads starts beating like a drum
And the thunder cracks the sky in two
The wind is gonna blow and the rain is gonna come
And the river's gonna run

I'm gonna take the train that's gonna get me there
All the tracks behind me are burning in the air
The cure is gonna kill me but I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

Julie Miller,"By the banks of the river, where the willows hang down,
And the wild birds a'warble with a low moaning sound,
Down in the hollow where the water runs cold,
It was there I first listened, to the lies that you told

Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
And the past I remember, time can't erase
The letter you wrote me, it was written in shame,
And I know that your conscience still echos my name

Now the nights are so lonely, Lord sorrow runs deep
But nothing is worse than these nights without sleep
I walk out alone and look at the sky,
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry

If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrels with them high bushy tails,
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails",Rock Salt and Nails,2001
Julie Miller,"She is smiling
Then she takes your hand
And with a kiss she lies

Without tears
That's how she cries
So no one hears

She is talking
But she speaks in code
Like a broken heart replies
'Cause that's just how she cries

That's how she cries
Without tears
That's how she cries
So no one hears, no hears

So the men penned goodbyes and wives hoped against hope

When you go through the flood

Julie Reeves,"It's three in the morning on a Saturday night
The laundry and dishes just ain't worth the fight
Headlights are dancing across the living room wall
And that lone distant highway just echoes the hall
Now the babies are sleeping on back in their rooms
And he's been passed out on the sofa since noon
And nobody told her about none of these things
And God only knows she'd leave there if heartaches had wings

If heartaches had wings she would fly
Away like some bird through the night
It's a long, long way from a young girl's dream
And she'd surely leave there 
If heartaches had wings

She grew up believing 
That wishes come true
A knight on a white horse
Like some young girls do
So she married her the captain 
Of the school football team
Just like she was supposed to 
As homecoming queen

She turns out the lights and she lays down in bed
The sounds of that highway still run through her head
She closes her eyes and she whispers those prayers
And falls asleep wondering does anyone care

And let it ease my mind

It's a wide, wide world looking out this window
Thirty thousand feet above the ground I grew up on
Just a small town girl out here chasing rainbows
Doing what I can to stand up on my own
You taught me well, you raised me right
So Mama don't cry

I remember standing at the end of the driveway
Looking down that highway wondering how far it goes
And I can feel your hand resting on my shoulder
Hear you saying, baby, don't forget when you're grown
That road will always lead you home

It's a wide, wide world looking out this window
Thirty thousand feet above the ground I grew up on
Just a small town girl out here chasing rainbows
Doing what I can to stand up on my own

1.
C'est un endroit qui ressemble à la Louisiane
A l'Italie
Il y'a du linge étendu sur la terrasse
Et c'est joli


On dirait le Sud
Le temps dure longtemps
Et la vie sûr'ment
Plus d'un million d'années
Et toujours en été

Y'a plein d'enfants qui se roul'nt sur la pelouse
Y'a plein de chiens
Y'a même un chat, un' tortue, des poissons rouges
Il ne manque de rien

Et la vie sûr'ment

Julie Zenatti,"Je voudrais que tu me consoles
Que tu me prennes dans tes bras
Tu le faisais comme personne
En trouvant les mots chaque fois

Je voudrais que tu me consoles
Afin que je ne sombre pas
Que tu me parles un peu des hommes
Pour m'expliquer je n'ai que toi

Il suffirait 
que tu m'apprennes
Comment ne plus aimer
Enfin apprendre à me passer de toi
Que je comprenne
Puisqu'il faut t’oublier
Savoir pourquoi j'ai tant besoin de toi

Je voudrais que tu me consoles
De celui qui m'a fait si mal
Ou de celui qui m'abandonne
M'aider à trouver ça banal
Il faudrait que tu me pardonnes
D'oublier celui que j'ai aimé
De l'ami, de l'amant ou de l'homme
Garder celui que j'ai pleuré

Est aujourd’hui finie

Des villes blanches que j'aimais, des filles que j'ai jadis connu 
J'ai quitté une amie, je vois encore ses yeux 
ses yeus mouillés de pluie, de la pluie de l'adieu

Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet

Go down where the people say 'Y'all'
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game and start playin' again

I'd like to stay
But I might have to go to start over again
Might go back down to Texas
Might go to somewhere that I've never been

And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song, start singin' again

I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin'
For answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories
Just to have somewhere to go

To get back in the saddle again

Give me everything good
I'll throw it away
I wish I could quit but I can't stand the shakes
Choking smoke, singing your praise

I rejoice, and complain
I never know what to say

And then make me stay?""

De retrouver mes anciennes écailles,
Sans fin, je rêve d'un nouveau Big Bang
Et d'un clash, d'un retour de boomerang
D'échanger ma peau de civilisé
Contre les poils d'un ours mal léché

Elle marchait sous la pluie sur ce pont de Paris,
Le cœur à l'agonie, aux angoisses de minuit,
Une femme qui pleure sous la pluie
Le soir sur un pont de Paris
Seule, c'est comme une maladie,
Un désastre, une hérésie

Hein, hein, hein",Nouveau Big Bang,1991
Julien Clerc,"Tout nous porte à frémir au désir, au plaisir
À lever le verrou qui nous retient de tout
Dans la peau du bagnard, tout nous pousse à vouloir
Vouloir battre les grains de beauté du destin.

Du ponton des marais, tout nous pousse à pleurer
À endosser la peau d'un poisson, d'un oiseau
Par nos gorges étranglées, tout nous porte à chanter,
Tout nous porte à frémir au désir au plaisir,

A pousser le verrou
qui nous sépare, qui nous sépare.",Le Verrou,1991
Julien Clerc,"La Californie, la Californie
La Californie, la Californie

La Californie s'endort près de la mer et ne connais pas l'été de la mer
La Californie est une frontière entre mer et terre le désert et la vie
La Californie, la Californie

La Californie, la Californie

Les palétuviers dorment sous le vents, la cannelle fauve embaume ton temps
La Californie es une frontière entre mer et terre le désert et la vie
La Californie, la Californie

La Californie, la Californie

Près des orangers c'est là que t'attends au fond de tes rêves ton prince charmant
La Californie, la Californie

La Californie, la Californie

Mais la Californie est si près des îles qu'en fermant le yeux tu pourrais la voir
Du fond de ton lit
La Californie, la Californie

La Californie, la Californie

La Californie, la Californie

La Californie, la Californie
La Californie, la Californie",La Californie,1994
Julien Clerc,"Quand je vois les motos sauvages
Qui traversent nos villages
Venues de Californie
De Flandres ou bien de Paris

Quand je vois filer les bolides
Les cuirs fauves et les cuivres
Qui traversent le pays
Dans le métal et le bruit

Moi je pense à la cavalerie
Moi je pense à la cavalerie

Quand s'éloigne la tourmente
Quand retombe la poussière pesante
Et que sombre le pays
Dans le sommeil et l'ennui

Comme dans les films héroïques
Aux moments les plus critiques
Quand tout croule dans ma vie
Quand tout semble compromis
Moi j'entends la cavalerie
Moi je pense à la cavalerie

Un jour je prendrai la route
Vers ailleurs coûte que coûte
Je traverserai la nuit
Pour rejoindre la cavalerie

J'aurai enfin tous les courages
Ce sera mon héritage
Et j'abolirai l'ennui
Dans une nouvelle chevalerie

Moi je pense à la cavalerie
Moi je pense à la cavalerie",La Cavalerie,1994
