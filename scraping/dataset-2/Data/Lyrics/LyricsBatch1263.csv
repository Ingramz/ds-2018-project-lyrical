Waylon Jennings,"A long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by the way
The good life he promised, ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
And the bad things he's done Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter, that pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

He likes the bright lights and night life and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over, she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
This good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
That pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked-mouthed ways
But then she don't understand",Good Hearted Woman [Live][Version],1976
Waylon Jennings,"There's a road in Oklahoma
Straighter than a preacher, longer than a memory
And it goes forever onward
It's been a good teacher for a lot of country boys like me

I push that load from here to someday
I'll push as long as I'm alive, but I don't know how long I'll last
'Cause it's just a road, it ain't no highway
Blowin' by the double five, I know I'm goin' way too fast

I've been down this road just searchin' for the end
And it don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standin' on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walkin' on a nowhere road

Some folks say, if you keep rollin'
And keep it on the yellow line, it'll take you to the big highway
But there's a toll to pay, so if you're goin'
The keeper of the gate is blind so you better be prepared to pay

I've been down this road just searchin' for the end
And it don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standin' on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walkin' on a nowhere road

",Nowhere Road [#],1976
Waylon Jennings,"All your ol' stations are being torn down, and the high flying trains no longer roar
The floors are all sagging with boards, at a suffering from not being used anymore

Things are all changing, the world's rearranging a time that will soon be no more
Where has a slow movin', once quickdraw outlaw got to go?

The whiskey that once settled the dust, and tasted so fine now taste so faint
And the mem'ries that once floated out come back stronger
More clearly, with each drink you take

The women that warmed you once thought so pretty now look haggard and old
Where has a slow movin', once quickdraw outlaw got to go?

The land where I travel, once fashioned with beauty, now stands with scars on her face
The wide open spaces are closing in quickly from the ways of the whole human race
And it's not that I blame them for claiming her bounty
I just wish they were takin' it slow
'Cause where has a slow movin', once quick draw outlaw got to go?
Where has a slow movin', once quick draw outlaw got to go?",Slow Movin' Outlaw,1976
Waylon Jennings,"Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I can't offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
And I can't offer you clothes your young body crave
But if you'd love me and say that you'll always be mine
Think of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save honey

When you are weary and tired of another man's gold
If you ever get lonesome remember this letter my own
But don't try to answer though I've suffered sorrow untold
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone",The Last Letter,1976
Waylon Jennings,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again) [#],1976
Waylon Jennings,"Lord, it's been rough and rocky travelin'
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I thought Nashville was the roughest
But I guess I've said the same about them all
Upon hell of an education in the cities
Of this nation me and Tompaul

I got busted in Laredo for reasons
That I'd rather not disclose
If you're stayin' in a motel there and leave there
Don't leave nothin' in your clothes

At the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I think they like to pick on me and Paul

On a package show in Buffalo with us
And Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and I just hung around
And I'd come there to pick not for the ride

We drunk a lot of whiskey
So I ain't sure we went on that night at all
I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul",Me and Paul,1976
Waylon Jennings,"I can give you golden tinkling bells to even dangle through your long black hair
I can give you magic satin slippers woven just to take you anywhere
I can give you all the love and tenderness a broken heart can spare
But Mona take the love I give don't ask for love I gave away back there
You could take the hand of any man and show him how to dream
Why do you look back into my dark and bitter past can't you see
Mona when you found me all I had was sad and broken dreams
Mona please be satisfied walking through tomorrow here with me

Waylon Jennings,"He's a giver, he'll give her the kind
Of attention that she's never known
He's a helper, he'll help her to open
The doors that she can't on her own.

He's a lover and he'll love her in ways
That she's never been loved before
He's a getter, he'll get her by gettin' her
Into the world she's been hungerin' for.

He's a charmer, he'll charm her with money
And manners that I never learned
He's a leader, he'll lead her across
Pretty bridges he's plannin' to burn.

He's a talker, he'll talk her right off of her feet
But he won't talk for long
'Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her the way
That I'd never, damned if he won't do her wrong.

He's a taker, he'll take her to places
And make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow.

And after he's taken the body and soul
She gives him he'll take her for granted
Take off and leave her taken all of her
Pride when he goes.

And make her fly higher than she's ever dared to

Waylon Jennings,"I've held it all inward, God knows, I've tried,
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,
To look in the mirror in total surprise.
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes. 

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life. 
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

It's a measure of people who don't understand,
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.

Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.

Waylon Jennings,"Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning
Donna on my mind the whole day through
Love can't come so quick and real without any warning
Wonder if she's thinking of me too

Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine
'Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind

You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway 
If I can't be there to control you
Like the other little children why
You're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin' 
Or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you
It's not supposed to be that way 
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway 
If I can't be there to console you

Waylon Jennings,"Baby, go down to the drugstore, buy me a guitar string
And be sure to wear your coat, girl, 'cause it might rain
'Cause honey, you know that rain is bad for my guitar strings

Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight
Put on the one that's warm and long
'Cause you're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song

Baby, I've tried your doctors, they just couldn't make me well
The higher I tried to climb, the further I fell
Guess it must have blew my mind sniffing the fumes of Hell

Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight
Put on the one that's warm and long
You're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song

Baby, throw away my pillow just before you turn the light
All you'll have next to you now will be the night
I'll be somewhere wrong, you'll be somewhere right

Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight
Put on the one that's warm and long
You're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song

Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.
Apart we've grown, now I can't go on alone.
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.

Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.

I bow my head, cause in the mornin' I'm a gonna be dead.
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.

We have spent a million dollars find out what we made
We have made the maidens marvel the things we do and say
Down down and out brother up up in the way

Just got to get away from here
If you see me gettin' smaller don't worry and no hurry I've got the right to disappear

Out in front of a main yard wet and lonely train

First was the spring and spring became the summer who'd believe you'd come along
Hands touching hands reaching out touching me touching you
Sweet Caroline good times never seemed so good
I'm inclined to believe they never would
Look at the night doesn't seem so lonely fill it up with only two

Boy when you lose the one you love, it's a stone cold bummer.
I just called you up to tell you I don't know what to say.
I wish you knew the way I felt.

This is gettin' funny, but their ain't nobody laughin' honey, 
Come on back home.

Tell me how you feel, though I can't stand this at all.
Can't you see its a mystery, I thought I was your lover.
Yes I could fly, I could lay down and die,
Six one way, half a dozen of the other.
I could say I'm sorry baby, enough's enough.
I'm gonna break right down and ball.

Tell me how you feel, though I can't stand this at all.
I was out to show you what I good man I could be,
You were out to hurt somebody.

Now I'm going crazy. Really did, and I ain't lying.
Get's so lonesome here in L.A., my summer's turned to autumn.

Waylon Jennings,"Here's a song I wrote on a plane between Dallas and Austin
Goin' to El Paso
Whoops
Now this is what gave us the idea to come down here,
This is a song about a guy that probably did as much for
Our kind of music as anybody.

Well the Honky Tonks in Texas were my natural second home
The way you tip your hat to the ladies in the rose of San Antone

I grew up on music that we call western swing
It don't matter whose in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King

Lord, I can still remember the way things were back then
In spite of all the hard times I'd live it all again
To hear the Texas Playboys and Tommy Duncan sing
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the King

You can hear the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville Tennessee
Its the home of country music on that we all agree
But when you cross that ol' Red River hoss,
That just don't mean a thing
Once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King

If you ain't never been there, then I guess you aint been told
That you just can't live in Texas unless you got alot of soul
Its the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing
He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the King.",Bob Wills Is Still the King,1977

Waylon Jennings,"You take the lady...I'll take the lesson
I can't say that anyone's...Doin' me wrong
Cause I allways knew....That the girl had a weakness
For whistlers and jugglers....and singers of songs

Now she was a child...Back when I first met her
And the woman inside her...Was just bein' born
And I knew she'd come with me...Cause she had a fever
For whistlers and jugglers...and singers of songs.

And the whistler will whistle her...A song she can dance to
And jugglers will cheer her...When she starts to cry
The singer will sing her.....A bed of red roses]
Where she might let you....lie by her side

She'll laugh in the face...of the wealthy and famous
And you'll never lose her..To the handsome or strong
But all of your life son...Watch over your shoulder
For whistlers and jusgglers...and singers of songas..

Repeat the chorus..........

He'll probably just ride away

Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornin's
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night

And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong he's just different

And I stopped him and called him by name
I said, ""The years haven't changed you
But he said, ""Good Lord, how you've changed!""

So we stood there and talked on the corner
And remembered the good times we had
Then he asked if we're happy together
And I only smiled and I said

""Yes, she keeps me off the streets
And she keeps me out of trouble
Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind
I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again""

We had us a round or two
We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's

I look for trouble and I found it son

Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun

I tried to run but I don't think I can

You make one move and you're a dead man friend

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back

And left me reeling on a steel reel rack

They got'em all in the jailhouse baby

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives

Son of a carhop and some all night dives

Dad drove a stock car to an early death

All I remember was a drunk man's breath

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


You know the story how the wheel goes 'round

Don't let them take you to the man down town

Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


I live with Angel she's a roadhouse queen

Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee

I want to love her but I don't know how

I'm at the bottom in the jailhouse now

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


You know the story about the jailhouse rock

Don't want to do it but just don't get caught

That bothered him so
He was impressive, young and aggressive
Saving the world on his own
Warm summer breezes, French wine and cheeses
Put his ambition at bay
The summers and winters scattered like splinters
And four or five years slipped away

He went to England, played the piano, and married
An actress named Kim
They had a good life, she was a good wife
And bore him a young son named Jim
All of the answers and all of the questions
He locked in his attic one day
Cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'
And twenty more years slipped away

War took his baby,
Bombs killed his lady and left him
With only one eye
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered
All he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling he was recalling
Answers that he never found
So he hopped in a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound

Now he lives in the islands, fishes the piling and drinks
His Green label each day
Writing his memoirs, losing his hearing
But he don't care what most people say
After eighty-six years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile and say

But I had a good life all the way""

We talked until two and then she said it's time for bed

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

Waylon Jennings,"His daddy was a honest man,a red dirt Georgia farmer
His mama lived a short life having kids and bailing hay
He had fifteen years of ache inside to wander
He jumped a freight in Waycross and wound up in L.A.

The cold nights had no pity on that Waycross Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry,then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco Mabel Joy
Destitutions child born on an L.A. street called shame

Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings it brought new meaning to his life
The night before she left sleep came and found that Waycross country boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine

Sunday morning found him beneath the red light at her door
A right cross sent him reeling and put him face down on the floor 
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
He said your Georgia neck is red,but sonny you're still green

He turned twenty-one in grey rock federal prison
The judge had no mercy on this Waycross,Georgia boy
Staring at those four grey wall in silence,Lord he listened
To the midnight freight he knew could take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him beneath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side he cried,have you seen Mabel Joy
Stunned and shaken someone said she don't live here no more
She left this house four years ago she was looking for

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife

To the places where the wild liquor flows

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God, we could have ridden his trail

They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his old guitar and made it down in Tennessee

Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray

I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin' up the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be the good Lord likes a little picking too

It was simple then like the freedom when you fall
And we were smaller then, you see, but soon we gathered like a storm.
They don't understand what that thunder meant at all.
Was he crucified? Was he done in by the lawman?
Are you satisfied that he'll never ride again?
Some people say he got away; they say he never died at all.
If that story's true, does it bother you, my friend?

No love at all is a poor old man standin' on the corner with his hat in his hand
And thare's no place to go, and he's feeling low

On the tennament row and that's a rough row to hoe

You can spend all your time making love you can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
And when you're looking for more freedom when nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door well you can't find it anywhere

When there's nothin' to believe in
Still you're coming back you're running back
You're coming back for more

Waylon Jennings,"Just like the sun over the mountain top you know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time like sunlight dancing on your skin
And I have never gone so long just for telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing that I can hide a few you see me better than I can
Out on the road that lies before me now there are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you will hold me now till I gain control again

And no matter what sea that I've been sailing on I'll always roll this way again

Well, did he make you cry? Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale

On past the milkyway to paradise

With the moon as our halo and the stars in our eyes

Caught like a wildfire out of control
There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).

And you talk about anything.

He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
Then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town
And forget about everything.

Spent on saving face

Wants to make some morning's fate

So starting today all I'm gonna be is her man
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter...

I'm a little bit late but I'm wise enough
I'm taking her by the hand
Startin' today all I want a be is her man",Her Man,1990
Waylon Jennings,"[Verse 1]
Reno and Me hit the freeway,south out of town on the run
Reno was driving he asked me to roll him one
I turned on the radio, I found us some sweet Emmylou
I sang the harmony,low down and out of key
Reno just howled at the moon

[Verse 2]
Somewhere outside Kansas City,on a highway that leads to Cheyenne
The radio put a song by a Mexican band
Well I guess we were lost in thoughts of brown skin girls,took a couple
Wrong turns in a row
Reno and Me just laughed and agreed
It don't matter which way you go

[Chorus]
It don't matter which way you go,when you're calling the highway your home
Every old town is your past burning down,it don't matter which way you go

[Verse 3]
All of our old friends got married,doing all of their business in town
Climbing a ladder that leads to a hole in the ground
Reno and Me talked it all out, one thing that we'll never know
What's the point of a race where you stay in one place
Believing there's somewhere to go

[Chorus: x2]",Reno and Me,1990
Waylon Jennings,"Verse 1:
E
I have battled with the demons for my soul
A
Like a soldier unafraid,stood straight and tall
E
With strong convictions fought for what I thought was right and wrong
D A E
But I wonder when it stands in judgement hall
D A E
Will it go down as one too close to call


Verse 2:
E
I have faced that cunning ennemy called time
A
For awhile I held him cold and to a draw
E
As he rode away he said another place and day
D A E
'Cause you can't erase the writing on the wall
D A E
Although this one was just too close to call


Verse 3:
E
As I wrestled with my deepest fear in life
A
I was captured by the shadows on the wall
E
I was brave but just the same,I was glad when morning came
D A E
Because now and then the footsteps in the hall
D A E
Remind me it was just too close to call


Verse 4:
E
I have watched my mind dance too close to the edge
A
As I stood among the crowd to see it fall
E
Sometimes now I cling to what I hope is sanity
D A E
I stagger on this fine like that I walk
D A E
And wonder is it just too close to call

Here I stand looking both ways again
I'm a dollar short on a three dollar night
Turning left because I ain't got no right

I keep thinking this time may be it
But somehow all the pieces just won't fit
But I'll always have a dream to hold on to
Just as long as I keep waking up with you

You told me once that storms never last 
I know it's true, oh so true
Just when I think the clouds will never pass
Like a silver lining you come shining through

I know you'll always be there right or wrong

I could turn my back on all the pain

I'm no fool and you're not changing
You know I'm telling the heartbreaking truth
You've gone wild and I'm going crazy
And what bothers me most is I don't bother you

Late at night you're such a great temptation
I'm too weak to fight you everytime

Waylon Jennings,"As we sat on the front porch
Of that ole gray house where I was born and raised
And stared out at the dusty fields
Where daddy's always worked hard every day
I think it kinda hurt him when I said daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow
He just sat there silent staring in his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes when he looked up
He said son I know at your age it feels like this old world is turning slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all where corn don't grow
But hard times are real there's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow

I remember feeling guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only seventeen back then but it seems like I knew more than I do now
I can't say he didn't tell me this city life's a hard row to hoe
It's funny how a dream can turn around where corn don't grow
But hard times are real...
You may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow",Where Corn Don't Grow,1990
Waylon Jennings,"Every since the day I was big enough to put my pants on by myself
You could find me somewhere with the radio turned on
Then one night I gave my heart to an old beat-up guitar
It never left my arms till I was almost grown
I had to try my hand as a workin' man tried to be my daddy's son
But my mind was packed and gone and headed south
Momma said I'll pray for you then she said goodbye
To the only one out of seven that didn't work out
Now I'm way down hear in Dixie playing honky tonk music
Keepin' some joint a jumpin' every night of the week
Lord knows it's hard to keep a dance hall woman happy
When you're drinkin' a little too much and you're workin' cheap

Well I ain't done a thing I can brag about to anyone back home
Just another night club singer with a real good band
If a jealous woman don't kill me and momma keeps on prayin'
Someday I might be more than what I am

We had the whole world at our feet
Everyone thought we were heading
Down a lovers easy street

We'd have a house out in the country
A picket fence, the whole nine yards
They said our love would last forever
It was written in the stars

Wrong
I should have known it all along
When the future looks to bright can't be anything but right
Wrong

I was all but devastated
When she told me we were through
In a while the heartache faded
And I found somebody new

I swore that this time would be different
I had it all figured out
I wouldn't make the same mistakes
I knew what love was all about

And lovin' the cowboy ways.
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes,
I burned up my childhood days.

I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter,
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long.
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them,
With the words of a sad country song.

My heroes have always been cowboys.
And they still are, it seems.
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery,
From being alone too long.
You could die from the cold, in the arms of a nightmare,
Knowin' well that your best days are gone.

Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen,
I let the words of my youth fade away.
Old worn-out saddles, and old worn-out memories,
With no one and no place to stay.

Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water
And only one way out of a motel room
Payments on the Cadillac and too many questions
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune

You'll see the distance right there in his eyes

Someone who's impressed by a couple of outlaws
Who's gold plated trophies have turned into rust

The only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk

Is when he's on a drunk

Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,1993

The second time I done it on my own

Nowadays they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy
Are still ridin' on his name

Well, if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right, do you think he might
Don't you know he would Watasha
Be right here by our side

If we left for a show in Provo
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride

Wherever he is I hope he's happy
You know I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
And he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell

I won't ask you no more questions
To the stories only Hank could tell

Back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint

Waylon Jennings,"I grew up in Wyoming
In and around Jackson's hole
In the shadows of the Tetons

Where summers are hot
And winters unbearably cold
But the Spring and the Fall
Are always as good as it gets
For over 70 years now
I'd watch the sun rise and set

I've been a cowboy
Working the round-ups in spring
I've lived in the mountains

Hunted the grizzly
Trapping the rivers and streams
Always the loner
I've treasured my freedom the most
And though I never married
As a young man I might have come close

From somewhere back east
She came to the valley
With a man who did her no good
He was fast with the ladies

A tin horn gambler
And a cheat whenever he could
She had no friends or family
Most of the time he was gone
He died in a card game
And she found herself all alone

Alone and afraid and left unprotected
'Cause he was all that she had
Maybe I should have

But I never told her
So she never knew he was bad
But I'll always remember
Standing and watching her cry
There was no one to help her
But I was determined to try

I mended her fences and
Fixed up her cabin
I had everything looking good
I laid by her food

And wood for the winter
Helping wherever I could
The more I was around her
The more I wanted to be
There was something about her
That brought out a good side of me

I went into town,I brought a new outfit
I got me a haircut and shave
I'd trek through the snow

For no good reason
Just to go by her cabin each day
I don't know about love
But I was quite taken in by it all
Till her brother came in the Spring
And he took her back to St. Paul

I don't go down to Jackson
Ain't nothing there but motels and bars
Too damn many tourists

No place to hide
They'll find you wherever you are
They like to call me old timer
I am getting older I guess
But I don't like the changes
'Cause I've seen it all at its best

When my life is over
I don't want to be left in town
But up in the mountains

There is a place
I've marked off my own piece of ground
High in the Tetons
Above and away from it all
From the top of old Grand

All the way to St. Paul",Old Timer (The Song),1994

When I was so lonesome

They've almost worn out the seat of my britches

Not like I thought it would be

Waylon Jennings,"My dad talks a lot about cowboys
Like John Wayne and people I don't even know
I like the cartoons on Saturday morning

He even bought me a big cowboy hat
And when I put it on with my boots and my Levi's
I can tell that he really likes that.

I love to watch Nickelodeon
You might say I grew up on Sesame street
My favorites are Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch
And I think the muppets are neat.

It's fun to play with, especially for boys
Girls don't much like it but that's okay
Boys don't like girls much anyway.

Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt
It may sound silly but it really don't hurt
To sing about good ol' dirt.

It hurts just a little if it gets in your eyes
You can put it in water and make mud pies
Babies will eat it but babies are dumb
They wet their diapers and suck on their thumbs.

Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt
It may sound silly but it really don't hurt

You can take it back home and nobody cares
You can throw it and kick and it don't even hurt

Just spread its wings and fly
It was then a thought came over me

A lot of problems would be gone
When you think of just
How much I'd save on shoes alone
If I could only fly.

I would never tear my clothes
Climbing in and out of trees
If I could only fly I'd never crawl
Or wear holes in my knees

And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

And fellers if I don't pull through just put a little golden football on my grave

And we've got to save the old Red White and Blue
Someone's got to swim out to the submarine and warn 'em
And Bare you know I hate like hell to ask you to

Knowin' someday it would be the Garden and the championship for me or him
And Coop if no one in this town is man enough to back you when Frank Miller comes
Then come High Noon I'll walk with you I may be young but I know how to use a gun
Judy Grable don't you cry you know you can be a star
And with my drinkin' I'd just hold you back
Go on and sign the contracts hon and I'll read about you

What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give

That the dollar sign chould be keeping us apart

When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you I'd come running back to you

Waylon Jennings,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

Everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the gettin' there is knowin' where I been before
I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man
So when you feel like runnin' for the back door, don't

I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world

She must have loved a little
Just to keep me hanging on
How could lips that kiss so sweet
Lie and be so wrong?

Our love was just a pattern
Of the perfect boy and girl
The only dream I own
In this world

Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl

As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy, all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay

I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did speak as I slowly walked by
Come sit here beside me and hear my sad story
For I'm a young cowboy and know I must die

So, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Once in the saddle I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle I used to go gay
First to the cardhouse and then down to Rosy's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dyin' today

Bring six tall young cowboys to carry my casket,
Six pretty maids for to sing me a song
Take me to green valleys, there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips, then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead.

Waylon Jennings,"When I noticed her the first time
I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
And her nose was pressed against the window pane

When she looked at me
She smiled and showed a place, where two teeth used to be
And I heard her, ask her mom
If she could come outside and play with me

We became as one and
Had a love without beginning or an end
And every day she lived with me
Was like a new day dawning once again

And I've loved her since
Every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

After many years our love grew silent
And at night I heard her cry
When she left me in the fall
I knew, that it would be our last goodbye

I was man enough to give her everything
She needed for a while
But in searching for a perfect love
I found that I could not give her a child

And I've loved her since
Every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

Now she lives a quiet life 
And is the mother of a little girl

He'd say, ""Boys I'm old and crazy but I still give a damn
And I still think the boys got screwed over in Vietnam""

He'd drag out that old uniform and say, ""They used to call me slim""
He never could get it buttoned up but the pride looked good on him
He still feels the way he felt over forty years ago
Here's to the old man, here's to G.I.Joe

He only sang the old songs, he's standing still in time
My Phillipino baby, right there on his mind
Then he'd talk about the big one, the war we didn't lose
He'd pick a little bit like Travis, re-enlistment blues

He'd drag out that old uniform and say, ""They used to call me Slim""

Waylon Jennings,"There are songs that birds don't sing to people
There are secrets that keep right through to the end
There are heroes who hide until forever
And I'm singing this song for one of them

He's the man that you passed on the road there
The one with his life on the loose
Going either somewhere or nowhere
Going without me, without you

For he is this world's constant orphan
Traveling out his lone time
Living on apples from orchards
Dying from grapes on the vine

You can find him in big city winters
Down where the mission bell cries
And sorrow echoes through summer
As he tries to close all his eyes

You can find him in Pittsburgh in Christmas
You can find him in Buffalo in June
And he knows all the back roads between them
Like the gypsy knows the moon

And it's route 22 all over again
Stick your thumb out and try to look like somebody's friend
Look strong at the man, gentle at the girl
And puzzled at the rest of the world

Living on apples from orchards
Dying from grapes on the vine",Grapes on the Vine,2004
Waylon Jennings,"[Chorus]
Hey Willie let's pack up and catch us a slow train
And go back to Phoenix to a far brighter day
Where stars were for shining in the Arizona sky
And music meant more than fortune or fame

Willie, we wandered from border to border
Singing our stories and living our songs
Seems the farther we go, all that grows closer
Is a mind full of memories we made years ago

[Chorus]

We rolled through the towns like a bus load of gypsies
Motels and hotels ain't no place to stay
The favors we're taking, the money we're making
Won't pay for the living,we're giving away

[Chorus]",Hey Willie,2004

I've made mistakes but I ain't mistaken
This time I think I've learnt

You're gonna hate, hate it

Selling us sermons, and songs made for the soul
Some of 'em yoyos, bozos and bimbos and heroes

Dressed up in perfect disguise
Pushing their science and fiction
Mixing the truth with the lies

So why we're all busy looking for answers

I've loved a lot of legends

To the man who rode a donkey

Of some returning sunrise
He'll call up all the riders in the sky

In my own way I'm a believer
In my own way right or wrong
I don't talk too much about it
It's something I keep working on
I don't have too much to build on
My faith has never been that strong

There's a man in that old building
He's a holy man, they say
He keeps talking about tomorrow
While I keep struggling with today
He preaches hell, fire and brimstone
And heaven seems so far away

I do believe in a higher power
One that loves us one and all
Not someone to solve our problems
Or to catch me when I fall
He gave us all a mind to think with
And to know what's right or wrong
He is that inner spirit
That keeps us strong

Sometimes won't know how to take him.

A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust, it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw.

A neighbor was passing my garden one time
She stopped and I knew right away 
That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say:

""that girl down the street should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot 
She knows not to speak to my child or to me.""
My neighbor then smiled and I thought:

A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still.

""oh! who was that brave girl so sweet? ""

Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from

Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked, “How come you killed that man”
I said, “I don't know why”

Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Makes some people go insane

And keep it on the yellow line, it'll take you to the big highway

And I'm just one step ahead of the blues.

Long before this old world had ever heard of me.
And I know it will hurt to see you go,
But we'll just add one more heartache to the score.
And though I still love you as before,
I'm just one step beyond caring any more. 

Bet that you're surprised that I could feel this way,
After staying home an' waiting night and day.
For someone who cared so much for me,
You'd come home just long enough to laugh at me.

I just know I could never feel the same,

He thinks he's Hank Williamshear him singing through the door
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview

There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother, 'cause his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and a few quite well-to-do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview

There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing some committed to Parkview

They wake us about 6:30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say ""Fantastic! There ain't nothing wrong with me.""
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me committed to Parkview",Committed To Parkview,2013
Waylon Jennings,"One old brown shoe falls in slow motion
And the bedsprings hover right above your head
As bed springs do, when you're beneath them
Someone else just climbed into your bed

By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix
She'd arranged for your shoes to be filled
Well, you've got your pride and a blue-steel '45
Waited for the other shoe to fall
And you waited for the other shoe to fall

Dig a double grave out in the meadow
And you'll curse the rain that turns the dirt to mud
You'll take 35 south towards Laredo
And you'll try to find a doctor that'll prescribe an elixir
That'll make everything better except your late wife and her lover

By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix
She'd sealed her fate and gotten herself killed
You've got your pride and a blue-steel '45

Waylon Jennings & Willie Nelson,"There's a road in Oklahoma
Straighter than a preacher, longer than a memory
And it goes forever onward
It's been a good teacher for a lot of country boys like me

I push that load from here to someday
I'll push as long as I'm alive, but I don't know how long I'll last
'Cause it's just a road, it ain't no highway
Blowin' by the double five, I know I'm goin' way too fast

I've been down this road just searchin' for the end
And it don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standin' on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walkin' on a nowhere road

Some folks say, if you keep rollin'
And keep it on the yellow line, it'll take you to the big highway
But there's a toll to pay, so if you're goin'
The keeper of the gate is blind so you better be prepared to pay

I've been down this road just searchin' for the end
And it don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standin' on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walkin' on a nowhere road

And it's so hard to change can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turnin' out and burnin' out and turnin' out the same
So put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making love you can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine

When there's nothin' to believe in
Still you're coming back you're running back

I wanna hold her tight all through the night

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1977
Wayne,"Long, long way to go 
Reading faces and trusting eyes 
I realize talk is cheap and slow 
Makes me choose from doors 
I gravitate to worn out paint broken glass and dirty wooden floors 
This daily routine slows to a crawl around here 

Did you call my name did you talk to me 
Did you write it down? 
I'll look in the letterbox 

Trying to bring it home 
But I can't rewind and all this time is looking shorter than it ever did 
Always a step behind 
But I steal a little here and there so I can use it at the end 

This daily routine never stops at all around here 

So I'll take it when it comes and share it if I can 
Or give it all away 
I'll take it to the sky just to see if it will fall 
It just might float away 

Did you call my name did I just not hear 
Did you drop it off? 
I'll look in the letterbox",Letterbox,1999
Wayne,"Waiting at the door for some kind of life 
You never step outside because the fears you fight 
Can turn the day to night 
But only in your head 
And you say you're the only one that knows 
Well I don't give in to that nobody but me stuff 
I know where you go when you're down 
That place where falling stars tear up the ground 
And pace around 

(All in all it's the same old thing 
Float around until you get pulled in 
Gather it up and we leave it behind 
For someone else to see) 

Take it as it comes, you take it when you want 
But don't waste a fight if it doesn't feel right 
But dear God don't give up 
Kisses on your hand 
And slaps on your face is part of life 
Everybody gets their share of both, love",All in All,2001
Wayne,"The days have passed when there weren't enough days before them to say remember when 
But you still say i can't wait until and you're still dreaming
I guess some things never die and the ones that do make you cry
And that one little sparkle in your eye is what keeps you going on and on
When you smile is it just for the lights
And when you pray does it come from deep inside
Did today look good when you went to bed last night

Every morning starts with a sunrise and no fair warning for what might pass your eyes
So don't let them make your head spin
Throw out a line and pull your soul in
Call your mother and tell her that you're fine

When you hurt there's always a reason why
But grief and pain are only passers by
So make sure tomorrow looks good before you sleep tonight

Don't ever let them bring you down
Try not to let them make you frown
'Cause in the morning when the light shines in
You know today you might win",Drop D,2001
Wayne,"I lost my balance and I fell to the floor. 
A different perspective no less and no more 
Gets harder to get up everytime I go down 
But the struggle to get up is what keeps me around 
Out of all the things I know 
I see that most of it comes slow 
And the things that keep me on the ground 
Are what I want around 

So check that water before you go in 
'Cause unseen changes might endanger your swim 
Before you know it you're carried away 
And somebody somewhere might need you someday 

Out of all the things I find 
I'll keep the ones that keep my mind 
The things that plant me in the ground 
Are what I want around. 

Here's the way that the deal goes down 
Life's passed out and there's nothing you can do 
About the fools around you but keep your guard up 
Remember to breathe 
And I figure it out every now and then 
When I look around at this place I'm in 
Then I let someone pinch me 
So I'll know I'm alive.",Figure It Out,2001

Head up, 
Let me draw the lines, 
And point out the fools, 
And give a little more time, 

All I have, is all I need, 
Sounds good, until I'm on my knees. 
Would you pick me up, and put me back in place, 
With a feeling inside born from an honest look on my face 
And say, 

Head up, 
Let me draw the lines,

And give a little more time.

And mend a heart,

Wayne,"If you leave would you take hold of this cancer that's in me 
I won't need it anymore - I think you know what I mean 
This tiny spot inside my heart that was meant to house a star has grown cold 
I've seen it happen a million times before - just never to me 
I guess some things are just the way they are 
Carousels should run straight ahead and never have to stop 
Broken dreams should be the ones where you get to wake up 
I'm all for learning life's hard lessons but enough is enough 
I'm feeling old 
I've seen it happen a million times before 

I'll surely run around when my head is gone 
I should've worn this crown of fools the first time I said hello

And heart can travel different roads 
So be careful. That you don't grow cold",If You Leave,2001

And all the lessons that you want to teach life's already done 
We don't think we're home yet 
But it can't be that far 
We don't think we're home yet 
But we're shooting at the stars 

Stuck in a chorus with life before us we're sure to sing 
So I checked the mail and the check is there 
Here's my offering 
Do you think we'll do what we said that we'd do when it's time to? 
Because out of time is not a reason it's a weakness that we cling to 

We're a long, long, long way from home",Shooting at the Stars,2001
Wayne,"I can carry this so far and then something must give way
Searching a lifetime for nothing wouldn't seem fair 
Bored by the overdone drama of it all 
Puzzled by the thin antique face there on the wall 
Following something that someone said must be there 
Pull back the reins and slow this mother down I'm falling off 
The faster you move the closer to the end and there's a lot that I haven't done 

I can see for the most part things that might drift away 
And with the speed that they pick up something must be there 

So I pull back the reins 

It's so simple when it's all brand new 
Somehow it all catches up with you 
Just don't let it slice you up and pass you around 

I will pull back the reins",Slow Down,2001
Wayne,"Ask your questions here 
I'll tell you what I know
Or at least what I think is so
Ask me for my help
I'll give you what I can
But don't always assume that I can lend a hand

If I smile that's entertainment
And if I frown don't say a word
Cause it's just my way and I'm not changing
After all these years in this world

I'll tell you right up front
When I gotta go
Cause I've got people waiting and things to do
So take me home
I've got places to be and things to see
So take me home",Take Me Home,2001

I won't sit down 'til I'm through 
And I take time because it's mine not so I can waste it on the things 
That I don't need to do 

I know what to look for in a wave 
Take a breath it'll be over soon 
And I'll do it with a whisper 
You won't even know that I'm in the room

What you see is only what you see 
What you feel covers the rest 
Tell me why the things I see just don't make me feel like everybody 
Wants to do there best

I would hate to think I let you down

But I've got different blood

If I tried to help you think and you tried to make me smile

As broken parts get worn and fail
One of two things should be done
Make repairs and carry on

Blessed is the one who journeys and then prevails
Righteous is the passer-by that helps the traveller's weary

Yeah, like Rockefeller need a Segal.
Like I needed my father,
(My life!)
But he needed a needle.
I need some meditation
So I can lead my people.
They askin' why?
Why did John Lennon leave the Beetles?
And Why every hood nigga
Feed off evil?
Answer my question before this
Bullet leave this Desert Eagle.

And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?

We are not the same,
I am a martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned them.
And all the pictures of me an M I burned them
So it ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile
So they ain't no proof I ever walked through 8 mile
And since their ain't no proof I never walked through 8 mile.
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down.
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile.
Damn I know his mama proud,
And since you helped me sell my dream,
We can share my mama now.
And like MJB, no more drama now.
Livin' the good life,
Me and Common on common ground.
I spit crack,
And niggas could drive it outta town.
Got a Chris Paul mind state,
I'm never out of bounds.
My life use to be empty
Like a Glock without a round.
Now my life full
Like a chopper with a thousand rounds.

And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?

Walked through the gates of hell,
See my Impala parked in front,
With the high beams on.
Me and the devil
Sharing chronic blunts.
Listening to The Chronic album,
Playin' backwards.
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus
For target practice.
My mind fucked up, so I
Cover it with a Raider hood.
I'm from the city that made you
Motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my Grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy,
But I bet that new Mercedes could.
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't
Escape the hood.
They took so many of my niggas,
That I should hate the hood.
But it's real niggas like me
That make the hood.
Ridin' slow in that Phantom
Just the way I should.
With the top back
And my Sox hat.
I'm Paid in Full,
The nigga Alvo couldn't stop that.
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back,
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back.

And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?

Wayne Armond,"Wake up, Maggie,
I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,2001

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

Of your latest companion
Do I know him
Have you told him what you told me
What's the course
Of your latest adventure
Does he track you, will he back you
Can he keep you free

There is more to life than dreaming
There is more to love than makin' it
There is more to you than meets the eye

What's the state
Of your new situation
Is he giving
Is he willing to let you be
What's the chance
For your new true confession
Does he make it, will he fake it
Can he really see

One way or another
We all lose a lover
Some live, some die
Some never learn to try
One love for another's lifetime

What's the price
Of your passing confusion
Have you sold out, can I hold out
Can I live that long
What's the dream
In the back of your memory
Can you say it, do you pray
Has your memory gone

We all lose a lover
Some die, some live
Some never learn to give

We use to sit close on my bedroom floor
But mama never let us close the door

You'd kiss me on the cheek, I had a silly smile on
Where has the time gone?

I loved you since Thundercats, Thundercats, Thundercats, ho
Back when MTV played music videos
You told me get a Jheri curl, mama said no
That's how long I've loved you

Remember when I used to have a high top fade?
Back when you use to rock a dookie braid
Friendship bracelets in the eighth grade
I loved you since back in the day

Everyday after school I'd pop, you'd lock, we'd act a fool
I was at your house, you was at mine

Meet you at the rink on Friday night
We'd rock, we'd skate, hold hands real tight

Bet that you could still put those same jeans on
Kiss me now and I'll have that silly smile on
Girl you still turn me on and on and on, on, on

I loved you since Thundercats, Thundercats, Thundercats, ho

You told me get a Jheri curl, mama said no

Remember when I use to have a high top fade?
Back when you use to rock a dookie braid
Friendship bracelets in the eighth grade
I loved you since back in the day

Now everybody you know how we use to do
In the parties back in the day
You know how we use to do, stand right here
I'mma stand right here
We all get in a line and we all be like

It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without an old school jam to step to
Remember when we'd do the Whop
The whole crowd drop, do the Robo Cop

Go girl do the Cabbage Patch
Jam Master J killing on the scratch
Members only, Kid 'n' Play
That's how we did it back in the day

I loved you since Thundercats, Thundercats, Thundercats, ho

Why am I here without you?
When there was so much left for us to do
How could the angels come so soon?

If I could make heaven wait
I'd find a way to ask God if He had
Made some mistake
If He'd save your wings for another day
If only I could make heaven wait

All your clothes are hanging up
Not a thing's been touched, I left it all the same
I wish that I could press rewind and go back in time
Just to see your face again

Cause I miss you, I need you
I'm so alone without you here with me
You were the reason that I breathe

If I could make heaven wait
I'd find a way to ask God if He had
Made some mistake

All those I would trade in my life
For a chance to say goodbye

Why don't we spend the day, doing a lot of nothing?
Cause anythings alright long as I'm with you baby
We don't need special plans, don't need no reservations
Cause my favorite place is right here with you
Don't want to live my life any other way
Cause baby, it's the simple things that can't be replaced
Un-perfect the way that we are.

That^ you may be the next to die?
They wrap you in a big white sheet
And then they burry you eight feet deep*
And then

Ah ha!*

The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out
The worms play pinochle on your snout
Your liver^ turns a slimy green
And pus runs out like big whipped^ cream
Your eyeballs, they turn to cherry red*
And that's what you look^ like^ when you are dead

Wayne County & The Electric Chairs,"I got a transexual feeling
It's hard to be true to the one that's really you
I got a scandalous feeling
It's hard to be true when they point and stare at you
Conditioned to portraying the mask of masculinity
Another blend of different shading
I am what I am
I don't give a damn

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know...
I wanna know, I wanna know
Are you man enough to be a...woman?

Footprints on my window
There's a man in my room; he's riding a broom
He took all my money
The jerk made me hurt; he looked like a baboon
XY, XXY
Gender identity, I got the power to be it
Voice in my head
Will not be dead

And this colossal wrong began
And suddenly there wasn't any shine left in the sun

By turning off your love

Become so colorless and numb

And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange

As you disappeared
The shadow of death came undone

And everything was orange

They have begun to celebrate
The tidal wave they think is great
The ever-beating heart that it wasn't

They have begun
They have begun
They have begun
To assassinate the sun

As you died in the night
A million stars formed into one
And became another sun
And everything was orange

And now this horrible machine
Churns out pain instead of love
And looks just like the sun
And everything was orange

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Who's gonna mend my rainbow?
Who's gonna separate all the swimming around,
Back there on the ground
Flowing right under the gate of 24 Sycamore
Where did my baby go?

Windows black, watched me crying and they said
It's all over, you have lost her
Why don't you run away?
What could I say? I said,

Where's the hand that I used to hold?
Once so warm but tonight so cold
Now she's gone we both must share the pain
She gone

Wayne Gratz,"Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space
Our love affair, may it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So, take my hand with a fervent prayer

Wayne Gratz,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were,1997
Wayne Gratz,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1998
Wayne Hancock,"There's some big black clouds blowing in from the west
I've been driving all day and I sure could use some rest
There's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs

I grew up on the road from town to town
My daddy's line of work, kept us moving around
I've got fond memories of the way things were back then
The warmth of the neon when a bad storm was moving in

We listened to the opry in small cafes
When we stopped to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time

I've got a  real nice room with a radio and TV
This here motel living is the only life for me
It looks like it'll be raining for quite some time
Mixed with the lightning is the glow from a neon sign

We listened to the opry in small cafes
When we stopped to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time

Wayne Hancock,"Now everybody that knows me
Knows just the way I feel
When my baby ain't around
I've lots of time to kill
I ain't into playing, no sir,
I don't run around
But, I'll be awful lonesome
'Till my sugar's back in town

Cause they ain't nobody's blues but my own
When my gal's gone they come around
Until she comes back home
It's the worst kind of heartache that I've known
Yeah, they ain't nobody's blues but my own

There's lots of pretty women
But only one can have my heart
Brother when she ain't around
My whole world just falls apart
But according to my schedule
She's gonna be back soon
Tonight I'll sleep out on the porch
Underneath that lonesome moon

You can have your cheap motels
And running around 'till late
Living in that kind of place
Is loving second rate

Then she's my lucky star",Ain't Nobody's Blues But My Own,1995
Wayne Hancock,"I've got a crazy little lady she's a wild cat
She's up fourteen floors and has a two room flat
She's my honey loving baby, hep cats call her sue
She really digs this kind of living
She sure ain't got the high-rise blues

This scene ain't nothing like the rural route
You ain't got to go travel to go stepping out
I'm just a kid from the country
And I ain't got no pals
I don't need nobody
Just my big city goodtime gal

Sometimes I tend to worry and wonder too
What's hillbilly guy like me gonna do
If the day ever comes
She don't want me hanging around
Well, I'll do a little jumping
And hit every joint in town

I've got a flat out yonder down Texas way

Wayne Hancock,"It's after two and it just stared to rain
The wind is blowing like an old freight train
A distant thunder stirs me from my bed
And all those longing memories
That I once thought were dead

Cold lonesome wind
Take me back home
Back to the country where I belong
Help me relive those days again
Take me back home
Cold lonesome wind

My dad made sure we never missed a meal
He worked those hours long and hard
To keep up on the bills
My mother she meant everything to him
And it's nights like this that really start me
Missing both of them

Cold lonesome wind
Take me back home
Back to the country where I belong
Help me relive those days again
Take me back home

I got a big date so don't make me late.""
He hits the main drag just as hard as he can go
They call him locomotive Joe, he's a railroad romeo

I was waitin' for my baby but my baby didn't call
Suddenly there came a stranger knockin' on my door
He told me there had been a wreck out on highway 54.

She was with another man was what the stranger said
I asked if she'd survived it but he slowly shook his head
They were on their way to the other side of town
They tried to beat a freight train, and the freight train ran 'em down

[Chorus]
Highway 54 took my love away from me
I knew she didn't want me, but I could not set her free
She was with another like so many times before
She paid the price of runnin' round out on highway 54.

(Yeah, run her down brother)

Many sleepless nights have passed my broken heart since then
The man that she was runnin' with once was my best friend

Imagine there's no countries

And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Where do they all come from?

Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby,1996
Wayne Kerr,"If ever you got rain in your heart, 
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

And let it be like they said it would be 
Me loving you girl, and you loving me. 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me) 
Run to me if you need a shoulder 
Now and then, you need someone older, 
So darling, you run to me. 

And when youÂ´re out in the cold, 
No one beside you, and no one to hold, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

And when youÂ´ve got nothing to lose, 
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me) 
Run to me if you need a shoulder 
Now and then you need someone older, 
So darling, you run to me.",Run to You,2008
Wayne King,"Little Miss Cecilia Green
Little over sweet sixteen
But the cutest flapper that you've ever seen
When the fellows pass her by
She will always wink her eye
When she talks to them
When she walks with them
This is what they'll cry

Does your mother know you're out Cecilia?
Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh my when I look in your eyes
Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?
Oh Cecilia
Say that you'll be mine

Many funny things occur
While the boys are courting her
I refer to one case in particular
She went with a boy named Joe
Who was always lisping so
When he'd ask this miss
For a little kiss it would sound just like this

Doeth your mother know you're out The-thiel-yuh
Doeth thee know that I'm about to thteal ""yuh""
Oh my when I look in your eyth
I feel very you know tho un-neth-the-tha-ry
How about a little kiss The-thiel-yuh
Jutht a kith you'll never mith The-thiel-yuh
Why do we two keep on wathting time?
Oh The-thiel-yuh
Thay that you'll be mine
Mine How about a little kith, the thiel yuh
Jutht  a kith you'll never mith, the thiel yuh.
Why do we two keep on wathing time 
Oh, the theil yuh",Cecilia,1965

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat

Wayne King,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine

Wayne King,"Sunset glow fades in the west, 
Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

Wayne King,"Those who dance and romance while they dance
They seem so happy and gay
Though they sing and they swing as they sway
Somehow I can't feel that way

For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart's calling to

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

While the throng's in the spell of a song
My thoughts keep drifting to you
While each pair seems to share their affair
They're making me blue

My dear heart, seems like a year since you've been out of my sight

And dear heart I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more

They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

It's like heaven to be near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stay

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content, near you

Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you

People who need people,

Hide all the need inside

Wayne King,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
",Goofus,1993
