Rage,"Here we are, we talk about too many things.
But we can't
Find the words when death is on it's way.

If we don't remember this
We won't be prepare for the final day.

A silent victory, it made me see
That all is meant to be,
My dearest friend, it's not the end.

Our time is short,
Our castles built on sand of make believe.
At the gates of eternity the heart is free.

And I will remember this
Something's there that's stronger than our pain.

A silent victory, it made me see
That all is meant to be,
My dearest friend, it's not the end.

A silence victory, it made me free
To step outside on me
And in the end I'm born again.

I reach out my hands to reality of life
Far beyond all images.

And I will remember this
Something's there that's stronger than our pain.

A silent victory, it made me see
That all is meant to be,
My dearest friend, it's not the end.

A silence victory, it made me free
To step outside on me
And in the end I'm born again.",Silent Victory,1996
Rage,"I listened inside myself,
The voice that I heard, it wasn't mine,
It came from time to time.
I listened real close and I found out

That someone was talking through my mind,
Told me wat to find.

With every sense on highest intense
I tried to understand and I
Asked in the dark
And got an answer and since then I know

I'm talking to the dead
I'm talking to the dead
You gotta hear me
Talking to the dead,

I'm talking to the dead
And I can hear them talk!

There are so many voices,
They all belong to different heads
And they all are dead.
They have eternal knowldge
And they will help me anytime,
They are on my mind.

With every sense on highest intense
I tried to understand and I
Asked in the dark
And got an answer and since then I know

Rage,"Like a kiss of evil it took hold on me.
Creeping paranoia, it will get me day by day.
Like the deadly viper with it's poisoned teeth
It is getting in my blood, a killing brain disease.

Oh, no, the thrill became a curse,
Oh, the right has turned to wrong.
It's just me, myself to blame,
Yes I could have seen it coming.

Now I'm a wasted man
This is 'cause I am under control.
Inside a self built cage,
Screaming out the rage, under control.
Enslave my soul, I'm under control.

I can't live without it and I need it now,
What is I know about it will destroy me anyhow.
I have lost my free will, it's enslaving me.
Face inside me mirror let me out and set me free.

Rage,"Headed away and took off in the sky,
The air was as bright as my mind.
And everything on the ground floated by,
A land of toys, undefined.

Glittering clouds that were puzzled in the air,
Hiding a secret, not easy to share.

I've got visions and I can't
Get then out of my mind,
It was a moment in time.
I've got visions and I can't
Get them out of my mind,
What am I leaving behind?
I've got visions...

I saw a face that I'll never forget,
Staring at me through the mist.
Leaving a trace that lead into my head,
The other side I have missed.

There in the hemispheres I caught a view in life
Where all is streaming and nothing will die.

I've got visions and I can't
Get then out of my mind,
It was a moment in time.
I've got visions and I can't
Get them out of my mind,
What am I leaving behind?
I've got visions...",Visions,1996
Rage,"In a dark and spooky graveyard,
There he's waiting in the deep
For the day when he will wake up
From his godless, dead like sleep.

Since a while she heard these voices,
Calling in her sleep at nights,
Telling her she has to return
To become his moldering wife.

Soon will come what she was told,
She cannot longer resist his call.

Oh, midnight and she's all alone
Among the graves where it's so dark and cold.
Oh, she's heard his infernal voice
From the vault.

Long ago, when they were younger
They were married, lucky times.
But then clouds locked the horizons,
A martyrdom for her life.

Then she's got this evil plan, she
Put the poison in his tea.
And he passed away, real slowly,
No one noticed, she was free.

Soon will come what she was told,
She cannot longer resist this call.

On, midnihgt and she's all alone
Among the graves where it's so dark and cold.
Oh, she's heard his infernal voice from the vault.

""The truth, give me the truth!
You've killed me and I want you to pay.
You've promised to be mine and I want you now.
I will make you follow!""

Now he took hold on her mind,
He's possessing her complete.
She's no longer self-controlled,
And he is moving her feet.

Lays her body then to rest,
Covers her with his caress.
And the ground is broken up
When the new born morning comes.

Now has come what she has told,
She couldn't longer resist his call.

Oh, midnight and she's all alone
Among the graves where it's so dark and cold.
Oh, she's heard his infernal voice

Rage,"The fire's burning bloody red
The tide is turning but we don't regret
The devil's demons 're coming in our lives

Look into our torture chambers, your life isn't worth a dime
Hating, raping, killing day by day

That's how, how we teat each other
We never learn from history, this world's a big absurdity
That's how, how we treat each other
We seem too blind to see it's us who's wasted in our hands at last

Dropped bombs are falling, falling to the ground

Rage,"As I walk the streets I feel no pain,
There is no love or hate, can't see no certain state I'm in.
And a fog has laid itself on my heart
Like this misty morning as this cloudy day begins.

Still I wonder should I be afraid
About what's happening and how long has it been -don't know.
Why did come this shadow in my head
Like I have lost my soul, like I'm alive but dead.

As I walk the streets I feel no fear,
Although I notice that there is no feeling anymore.
And I try to send my mind back to the times
When I was able to live something to the core.

Dark, dark as the grave, my heart is dead,
I'm just a slave to what they've said. (this decay)
Still I'm alive but I feel dead.
Dark, dark as the grave, my heart is dead,
I'm just a slave to when you call, (my disease)
Still I'm alive but I must be dead.

Alive but dead

Darkness, there's darkness everywhere.
You gotta help me out of here,
I don't want to stay alive without the capability to feel!",Alive But Dead,1996
Rage,"Awakening this curse was the least of all my fears.
If I could turn back time to free me from this crime.

It started back in time when something stole my mind
and led me through aeons to place and time unknown.

I lived their life, lost in their time, without my face.

Take me back home from these cryptic walls.
I wait for a sign from my own reality, I wait here
in a nameless time.

A certain time passed by, I returned to my life
with memories hard to find, a secret in my mind.

I found it out, I've learned about the place I've been.

Take me away to these cryptic walls.
I wait for a sign from this old reality, it calls me
from a nameless time.
Take me back to these cryptic walls,
to this desert place and this strange reality, it calls me
from a nameless time.

[The Expedition]

I broke up to find this place, find those from the elder race.
In this unknown desert land I was digging in the sand.
Found these ruins, blocks of stone, older than the Egypt ones.

Climbed in caves, unspeakable, far down in the planets depths.

There were these enchanted books, pages that I've known too well,
written by the aliens ‘bout the way their study's been.
They transformed through space and time in all kinds of living minds
learning this way everything how through times the culture's been.

And I imagined how it's been like traveling through a name less time.
And I remembered how I felt when I was
in a nameless time, in a nameless time...

Take me home from these cryptic vaults.
I wait for a sign from my own reality, I wait here
in a nameless time.

[Finding Out]

Although the most I knew I needed a final proof
if I'd been one of them. And then these pages came :

My written words! So I'd been here in one of them...

Take me back home from these cryptic vaults.
‘cause I've been alive in this strange reality,

release me from this nameless time.
Take me home from these cryptic vaults.
I'm cursed for all time in this strange reality,
release me from this nameless time...",In a Nameless Time,1996
Rage,"See these people like me, living in this dirty place
Feel this depression in these streets that lame the brain

It kills the will that drives me on
'Cause where's no hope all power's gone
Why Am I here? A senseless birth
I'm not afraid to leave this earth

Heal these hollow eyes that keep on starting at these walls
Fill the empty space that's in these heads where chaos crawls

'Cause from the mud there comes disease
A new born hate disturbs the peace
A fatal end to all my grief
I've lost my pride, my self belief

I get my food from an unknown hand
I did nothing for it, understand

Still I'm waiting for a reason that could make a difference
But this is just another wasted day
Give me something to rely on, I don't know where I'm going
This is just another wasted day

Hear the voiceless calling in a world of noisy gear
Find the answer for a human child why it is here

'Cause from the mud there comes disease
A new born hate disturbs the peace

Lost imaginations
coming back to scare the body
GOing down in fever
drawn to the flame

A sweet pain to cut the indifference
a forbidden love to come

Rage,"Once our eyes stare hollow in to nothing
Our fingers clutching helpless in the void
Then our skulls won't tell about our past lives
Rich or poor, we're gonna be destroyed

Nothing gonna save us from death, leave it all behind

Fall to dry but never leave a stain

Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace

I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run
I'm not a fugitive on the run

Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off

Nevertheless they could not understand
I am a black man and I could never be a veteran
On the strength of situations, I'm real
I got a raw deal, so I'm lookin' for the steel, looking for the steel

I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself, because I never did
I wasn't with it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me, begun to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They'll criticize me for some crime

I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened it and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself, because I never did
I wasn't with it, but just that very minute

Mmm, mmm, mmm
I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened it and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn

(Death Row-ow, Death Row)

Shucks, stomping in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditching you klutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread
Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskating
On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG popping all that junk
About ""I'll fuck you up"", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day demonstration beat conversation

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been working on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuck against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

Killing up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em sliding in their eel-skins, grooving in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop being a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoos that's how they got you
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and originals, here come the mission
Making biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey
Look, I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce in the house

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad

Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'

For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free

We are the force of another creation

And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like

Shucks, stomping in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditching you klutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread
Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskating
On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG popping all that junk
About ""I'll fuck you up"", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day demonstration beat conversation

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been working on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuck against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

Killing up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em sliding in their eel-skins, grooving in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop being a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoos that's how they got you
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and originals, here come the mission
Making biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey
Look, I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce in the house

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

And I'll take your word that you'll come back alright

It seems you've pack your bags like every night

Say I've let you down

Ones again here we go through that old procedure
You screaming its over between us but I don't believe ya
You such a diva, a drama queen
Girl why you blowing up like a Osama's been
What you want a argument well I ain't speaking
We come to far now and I ain't leaving
If we gotta problem let's get on top of it
We ain't gotta split we can conquer it
But we gotta quit over reacting
Imagine just last night we're romancing
First passion now we be clashing
I know what's happening you throw in a tantrum
As a man I'm making the first move
You know I never do nothing to blatantly hurt you
We got a situation to work through
But patients a virtue and baby it take two so

I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out

Define the man you want to be

Toast the good and the bad 
Feel the sting of your memories
Carry me to bed,
My foolish old age makes a wise old head
Let this be last
For the time has come and all things must pass
Let me hear you say
What a wise old man told you yesterday
So ease your mind, my boy
Ease your mind, my boy
Ease your mind

Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it

[And I] And I say what's tight 
cause a sista write rhymes all day and all night
Dwellin South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
in seclusion, using fake pseudonyms [I'm true bad]
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs 
with doo rags hangin from my pockets
[Me] Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin [So]
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive 
off of five two fives; disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
for takin mad niggaz titles!
Wetter than a resevoir; lurking in the bushes 
striking blows like Chesamar(?) code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

[Chorus]
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and plans is tight
[Tight] Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

A black QUEEN, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me DIFFERENT
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these TIGHT BUTTAS, creme de la GUTTAS
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God 
[What?] that gets blunted - watch rhymers runneth, over
See me in the camel Range Rover 
[Chop] And I won't stop for Jake 
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
[NOW] Show you the way to blow, better than I tell you
Word to my beeper and my cellu-lar [What?] Polo curls
Diggin all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls

[Chorus]

WHO THE TIGHTEST?  I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me cause I be the bitch [I swear]
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair
[Yeah] I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeatin me is morbid
'cause I get you open like the comin of the Pope 
when I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit
[Peace, peace] Peace to niggaz I rhyme wit
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin
[We pros] I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and why chromosome
So SEE MY NAME tagged in bold or italics [Bow, bitch]
'cause I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in god's places
Suspicious of all

Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like cobra heads
Till I'm old and dead

Wanna find a new home

My debut made you
Wonder who
Shit blazes so much
You wish you could play out
So you could blaze, too
Before I shout you
Or give reason to doubt you
I study shit and re-analyze everything about you
My rhymes on the preserve

Everything up in your stash and in the reserve
Fuck that!
Hook up all my lyrics on the echos and the re-verbs
Never fuck with these herbs

Dirty baggy jeans
Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match

Of bullets to blow up the map

The quick to bust your ass niggas
Do anything in this world to get the cash niggas

Rob them and get away in a car and crash niggas
What!'s the world gonna do when I drop the smash nigga
Iron all in your face don't make me pull the trigga
Another reason for me to have to poor my own swigga
Thought I was posing for word up but a fed took my picture
Surgeon general I represent the underneath

Brick layer hardcore smash your front teeth
Wilding it straight giving their mother mad grief

Leave em all stiff, blow smoke from this foul drift
Nigga with the 6 story, throw em off the cliff
As I speak the shit to put my name on the list
The small thug with a slug put a mark on his wrist
A tattoo of pyramids, puttin' hollows in clips
Peeped your gat, jammed tight, Ross your lookin' to riff (what the fuck?)
QB's type shit, cause we runnin' your clique
See me in the drop, with your six, sayin' she snitched
But never that, 'cause-o, high beam through the window 
My lookouts move slow, they heard you never blast though
Got a safe in your crib, sham, you know the code

Ignorant, vulgar, on your tape recorder
Idol to your son and probably lover to your daughter
Fatman son, wilted grandson, ? nephew, Frank the cousin

Uh huh, one more time, uh huh, spliff, come on
Bust my gun, like Colombians
Make niggas collapse like fucked up lungs

Better obey the laws of the land
Or lay still like soldiers of fortune in Nam
Closed coffin with flags folded in half
Triangular shape, blow out the candles with grace
For fabulous tastes, some will, battle for space
Pay the ultimate price, poltergeist
Put the holy ghost in your life, bring you closer to Christ
Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight
Re-sculpture the mic, then smash heads like the opium bite
Prophet in vein, Metropolis claim body and soul
ID's controlled in the optical frame
Never stoppin' the game
Remove your squad with steady plans

Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

[Chorus]
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you movin for.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

[Chorus]

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.
Now we coppin' platinum things.
Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.
Ramp's the rugged MC.
My squad keeps growin.
Where you think you goin.'

Chief gunnin' to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.
Now low muscles moves.
Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.
Son gets school, wit the dummin' crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn
Like James Evans when I'm blowin'.
Fuck is wrong wit cha.

Where you think you're goin'.
Where you think you're goin'.

Rock the mic crazy, wouldn't wanna be ya
Had a nice wing since my early teens
Now I'm grown rocking microphones
Sin, sin

Said I learned new ways
Gotta thank God for my chance to blaze
Next album gonna see a fat healthy raise
And he make mistakes, say that's the brakes

True, hit 'em with the

Fine young woman now, long time coming now

Thank the fans for they love and affection
Heard me with the Fugees, still ain't making a connection

Fulfill my destiny wasn't nothing y'all could tell me
Ripping down the stage with a baby in my belly
Adding up to math, applying everything I learned
While a dummy kept going on tour and get burned, see

I got what you want, I got what you need
Rep chicks on the strip, rep thugs on the street
I got what you want, I got what you need

Dirty South y'all, handle B.I.
Up top y'all, handle your B.I.

Now make way for a sister little feisty foul mouth
Say what's that all about
('Bout, 'bout)
It's about one, two, three, four, five for the rating

A penny for the hating, y'all know my ways
Staying up in the game of this MC craze
Kind of wonder what if I'd of dropped back in the days, say

Rhymes I toss it, taking no losses
Let management tell you who your new boss is
People stay repping up on the West Coast
Word is bond to my flow, y'all got the best 'dro

Ain't seen nothing like it, ain't bring nothing like it
If my rhymes strike a nerve
Ain't mean nothing by it
Dirty Harriet

And I be stepping to the left
You bust for Diablo, I still bust for UCEF
Try'na see me on the MC tip, now, child please
Vocab for years and freak enough stylees, swing

Rep the thing for my Hip-Hop brothers
Take care of them before I take care of others
Juice Crew, Rakim, Prince, big influence
You saying I'm the dopest, but I already knew this

Say one check two check, everywhere check check
Check for me, we haven't ever even met yet
Gotta thank God I said I gotta thank God
I could look this fly and rock it this hard

I got what you want, I got what you need
Rep chicks on the strength, rep thugs on the street
East Coast y'all, handle your B.I.

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm on the roll like butter
Flow gutter, fuck what a bitch going through
Do or die is what you gon' do
I warn you it's gonna get you and your guys killed
With my skills stay on your toes like high heels
And handle bars like bikes 'bout to blow like innertubes

See me in the tube in the views to interludes
Never see me in the nude, Blade gon' bend the rules
Lock the street coming through with more rocks than Pete
I'm into jewels I will not repeat
Y'all obsolete, Sonya Blade y'all
It's murder when they drop the beat

I spit it once, I'm hungry spit at lunch
One take, I hate boxes so I don't punch
I got a hunch, y'all figure, y'all gon' stop my figgas
Get on some rah-rah with Eve and Rah Digga

How they gonna stop us Digga?
Tryna shine, the rest of them bitches
Is past tense and out of time
'Cause my time line consists of many dreams shattered
Trying to run up with two ryders deep as if it mattered

When real bitches get to rockin', heads knockin'
All dem chickens in their coupe gon do is get to squawkin'
All the hating do is feed my temper, let me live
Ice grillin' eyein' my clothes, I'm eyein' the crib
E V E spell it out when you speak about her
The only one out the bunch to hate
The rest gon' crowd around her

Majority rules, it's our time, back the fuck up
'Cause the shit you sayin' out your mouth
Make me crack the fuck up
Laugh hard 'cause we pass y'all so dash broad
Lay my shit by myself in the booth
While y'all need flash cards

Watch me sink three points
Smash your whole LP with just my lead joint
It's the rhyme super bitch gon' stay forever wildin'
Smooth with the pen, Shakespeare, Edgar Allen
Hot chick, catastrophic, blast the hot shit

Your whole verse whack and bare no facts or logic
Smash your clique in, y'all niggas only heard tidbits
I put that on Gabana every rhyme I done spitted
One two, one two, your whole crew I dismantle
Rock fly gear and stay clear of sex scandals
With drogues to spark wait for shows to start

My put my niggas down if they know their parts
Caramel give 'em hell from Bricks to Anadel
Rappers tryna compete get ate like Samuel
By a sister who twist a few L's rip it dually
The song say It Ain't My Fault like Mystikal

Flipmode the imperial
You know you love it when you hear us on the radio
Go cop the joint and play the shit up in your stereo
Or in the streets up in your Jeeps, or in the disco
And if you want the fly shit, my nigga, here we go
You know it's Digga lookin' pretty in the video
With Bus-a-Bus up in the cut, but you don't hear me though
Just when you think we done we hit y'all, we got plenty mo'
Blow!

[Rah Digga]
It be's the little mama, lip gloss and eyeliner
The only shit poppin' like White Castle or the Donna
Rah Digga make the joints that the DJs blast
Ghetto diva in the Source with the three page ad
Watch as the hood rat messiah climb swiftly
Labels scared to death to let their artist bomb with me
'Cause you can send your thuggest MC and watch me son 'em
The ruggedest bitch don't even rhyme about gunnin'
Got joints circulating like them old karate flicks
Buncha Rah Digga shirts on some big body chicks
Throw my shit in your hoopty or your luxury trucks
And make the quickest turn around like 'dro for twenty bucks
And I'll still be the greatest if this rap shit fail me
Back to jackin' bootleg flicks from out the deli
Livin' off the interest
Sippin' on Tequila with my logo on the side of fuckin' eighteen-wheelers

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Ay, yo, yo, yo
Raze and dazzle niggas like y'all
Spread niggas like you and dismantle niggas like y'all
I got the thing that'll majorly handle niggas like y'all
Fight y'all; bust a semi and cancel niggas like y'all
I know some joke niggas who love to hassle niggas like y'all
Talk, and fix, and simply dance on niggas like y'all
Trample niggas like y'all
Make examples outta niggas like y'all
Grit their teeth and cock the hammer up inside the dance hall
Thugs - here's another sample for niggas like y'all
Or for the ones who pass and light a Roman candle for niggas like y'all
Fight for niggas like y'all
Grab the mic from motherfuckers like y'all
Blow the spot in the night for all my niggas like y'all
My get high niggas; I blaze for niggas like y'all
Stink the spot up with 'dro; now spray the fuckin' Lysol
You know we be the ultimate
We fuckin' with some other shit
And when we hit y'all
Yes, we sit and watch y'all niggas ride the dick

Yo, make sure you see what we doing now; put on your binoculars
Then I gas ya like a paid Latino down at Banco Popular

Rah Digga underground and gon' always blow the spot for ya
Longest runnin' shit since the Phantom of the Opera

Holding a 12-shot semi with a little red dot for ya

All my bitches y'all, all my bitches y'all
Flipmode y'all, Flipmode y'all
Hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

Never judge a nigga like the cover of a book
Fuck around and get shot back of the foot
Nigga, fall, stumble and look, nervous and shook
Dragged in the alley and book and beat down to a pulp

Shot up my cops, Dirty Harry
You stickin' me is like niggas fuckin' the Virgin Mary
Shit we carry will have you found layin' down
Somewhere damp and muddy, split your tummy
Puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody

So now I leave your body to rot
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin' water, boil in a pot
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin' your pops?

You messin' wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the excursion, heads is turnin'
Flipmode we still mergin'
Now we splurgin' in suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans

Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin' words in 240 seconds
Get three to get your bitch neck and four to even the score
Graveyard shifter mister, y'all believe in the law

Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton
Suede ballet shoes steppin', do the best that I can can
Like Pointer sisters, who could join the wizard?
Talkin' outta place, I pick the knife up and cut the tongue
Right outta your mouth and fuck your life up

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Before all the plaques and the Source Aawards
Y'all niggas wanna dick ride, so jump aboard
It's a first class ass whippin', rampage, I ain't trippin'
Check all the magazine clippin's

Yo, I pluck pigeons, get brains in expeditions
Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy, like midnight, I'm pickin'
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens

Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, in these violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, we clear classes

Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mash his ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin’ half ass shit, splash kids
Poke ‘em with the bassinet in the neck, graphic

Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin' in tongue with six blocks callin' my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin' your drums with hot shit and more to come

But then we manifest the truth
The niggas fight predictions from The Bible
Betrayal for niggas is suicidal
Kick swift shit niggas rock harder than Limp Bizkit
Dirty Harriet floodin' all through your district

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you

With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado

Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks ?N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool

in seclusion, using fake pseudonyms [I'm true bad]
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs 
with doo rags hangin from my pockets
[Me] Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin [So]
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive 
off of five two fives; disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
for takin mad niggaz titles!

striking blows like Chesamar(?) code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel

Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these TIGHT BUTTAS, creme de la GUTTAS
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God

See me in the camel Range Rover

And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate

WHO THE TIGHTEST?  I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest

Go forward, your chance of defeatin me is morbid
'cause I get you open like the comin of the Pope 
when I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit

My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin
[We pros] I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and why chromosome
So SEE MY NAME tagged in bold or italics [Bow, bitch]
'cause I'll be the only one salvaged

Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

For fabulous tastes, some will, battle for space
Pay the ultimate price, poltergeist
Put the holy ghost in your life, bring you closer to Christ
Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight
Resculpture the mic, then smash heads like the opium bite
Prophet in vein, Metropolis claim body and soul
ID's controlled in the optical frame
Never stoppin the game
Remove your squad with steady plans
I body slam punks like Superstar Billy Gramm

Rah Digga,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that....",State Vs Kirk Jones,2000

Raw your wack set is faker than a bomb threat
By a nervous terrorist who's so scared that his palms wet

Before I care about your take on me, we take on you

Yo, yo, yo

You fakin the part of gangster, til niggaz break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
One, two, three, four
Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade

Schemin' ass honey tryin' to get my shine
Such a lady of grace, with such a hood frame of mind
Summertime's here, Daisy Dukes are in order
Swingin' with my cousin a little thick, a little shorter
Five in the whip, we like to flow thick
CD's in a clip, let's take a road trip
Sayin' what we gonna do now, dice some trees
Take a ride in the Range through the block and skeez
We conceited asses, wavin' to the masses
Cats doin' wheelies on they bikes fly past us
Headin' to the mall or maybe to Phil's

Corner reserved and they gotta pool table

You a virgin? You know you do this often
You're thing is so deep you can drown a school of dogs in
It's like every M.C., she done did it
Redman tapped, Lil' Weezy done hit it
Even them Boys from the Beastie done did it
Lil' Cease and R&B singers split it
Rumor has it from word of mouth
That ya thing's more dirtier than the dirty south
And I keep model chicks screamin' out, he a dog
Bust his ears hard, now she look like Nia Long

Lit the choc' lye, and passed it clockwise
Let me knock the boots, 'Til I was cock-eyed

I told her, think of this before you try to be foul
There's ladies at the bar that could be buyin' me rounds
And all type models that be eyein' me down
I stay and you say good-bye to me now?

Now just when I thought, everything was cool
Let a brother even have a key
I said I let him use the car, then he took it too far
Brother out there cheatin' on me
Time to face the truth, when I really didn't want to
How the hell all these hoes keep gettin' my number?
Who was it? A distant cousin, came to see you
In prison, they said you already had a visit
Beefin' wit these strangers, how do you explain this?
Came this close to lettin' you put it in my anus
Wakin' up, middle of the night, brother out
Time to get the steppin', back to ya mother house, boy

Impressive reasons fill the caverns of my mind
No celebration for the people that I didn't know
Connected even though there's nothing left to find

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my insperiation help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneat the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question
But still I wonder why

Poetic justice never seems to make the world feel right
Chaotic voices in the darkenss call your name
You turn away from me whenever I remind you
Of the day the sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my insperiation help me end my desperation now

I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny

But still I wonder why

There's so much pain
There's so much war
There's so much hurt
I can't take no more
Won't you come and take me to another day
Take me far away

Rah Digga,"Hold on now, don't die now, be strong now
He said, I was born a crack baby
In a plastic bag in the alley
Raised in a foster home
With no mother to love and I never knew my papi
Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin
Used to sing don't worry, be happy
Lord how can I be happy
When I don't even know my own family tree Lord

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

Gang poppin' things, doing drive-by's and angers
Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher
The teacher let them know that it ain't all good
'Cause the gang was created to protect the neighborhood, now
All you red now, all you blue now
All you yellow now, follow me now
To that place of righteousness
Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness, he said

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

In my father's kingdom there are many mansions
All the rooms are free, there is no tax collection
I can see Biggie, Tupac, Moses and Abraham
Jason, the one and two's, jamming with the sun of man

I've been kicked, I've been stabbed
I've been shot, I've been ? by a
Person that I thought I trusted, where I live
It's a war at the cribs, walk with a strap
Myself 'cause I don't want nobody's son on my back
My mind playing tricks ?, to really ?
Me out in five unless I take another hit
I done seen the sun set on the other side of town
Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down
? but I know I'm born dying
Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying
For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan
In this cold dark world with no patience
We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing
The Africans, Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

Whoa, we the next generation, look at what we facing
The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it
Metal detectors replace music classes
Angry little kids want to beat their teacher's asses
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose
Reality TV be reality for who
I don't question what the Lord found in me
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries
Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us
Now we got stars, how many will there be left of us

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life

So then we tried - I'm siging it slow
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

[Chorus]
I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' call and ask how it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)
So then we tried - I'm siging it slow
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)

I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling Denzel

You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth

Better let it off cause you set it off

Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white

Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle

Though I didn't know what for

To some old country song

And I would play along
To some Crazy Horse songs

Just a life

Made some fans

In the poetry that I wrote

To all my peeps in the penitentiary
Free eventually, spiritually and mentally
We had to rep essentially
While you was on dissin ground

We was holdin' fort down
Shit is so real I'm even back and forth to court now
We all struggle in the jungle for a bundle
Awaitin' the day, 'til the whole earth crumble

It's like a royal rumble in the streets now
When cats blow four pounds see trial nobody be around
Just the other day my brother Kwan got bagged
Three half ounces, three nickel bags in his ass

No doubt Son, shit is on smash, we want cash
To lamp like my cousin Thrash, with mad G's in his stash
So hold your head Dunn, and have no fear

To shoot as many a clan concerned from Clue to Clutch
Who the fuck said that color matter? Your own brother 
Blacker than black'll leave you in the gutter splattered
It's automatic now with all the static

Only a coward or a faggot hides his flowers in the attic
I keep em close, to shine to blossom, try to floss em
Cried every time I lost one, fake niggaz come a dime a dozen
That's why I'm buggin, shorties is luggin heavy metal

Just call me a rebel cause I'ma keep reppin for every ghetto
For better or worse, up in the Jetta it hurts

To do the shit the niggas out the Nickel do, yet
Like in the Nickel ain't a night without gunshots
9mm's and them Uzis ain't shit
You better be prepared to shoot a gang of muthafuckas
Cause them niggas out the Nickel just love to click
And fuck a pussy up until a pussy can't see straight
Hear straight, walk straight, do shit straight

A lot of ignorant muthafuckas out of 5th Ward'll
Deal with petty crime, and maybe snatch a bitch purse
You're probably sayin, ""How you still livin to tell the story?""
When you live in the jungle, you learn to shoot a man first
And I'm a nigga quick to shoot a nigga when his guard's down
Fuck that other shit, let me regret it when I'm done
Fuckin with the beat, to tell the truth, is kinda dangerous
Cause ever since a kid I never really caught one
I learned to shoot, let go if muthafuckas triple-crossed me
Never trust a bitch and learned to juggle cocaine
Keep a nigga's ass off of Liberty and Waco
Cause that right there's a corner the hardrock claim
Now many say that they done come up out of 5th Ward
Mingled with the roughest, and the toughest, and the best
If ever there's a nigga who you think ain't out of 5th Ward
I'm a show you how you put his ass to a test
Ask him where he from, and if he stutter, he a lyin ass
Brothers out the Nickel don't forget where they from
Ain't a bitch that a 5th Ward man ain't fucked
Ain't a muthafuckin crime his ass ain't done
Anytime you see em, that's a set of ex-convicts

So I'ma show a 4th Ward nigga where it'is at

I walk by myself, and I don't look over my back
Cause who and all your posse and your friends and your family
Ain't never gon' be ready for the wrath of the king
So you and all your dancers that you call your little lynch mob
Ain't even got no business with your ass in the ring

And last muthafucka you should want to fuck with
At heart I'm still a Geto Boy, trigger-happy nigga

Known to take your money, take your life, and take your jewelry

Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When he's just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fast paced pipe dreams and shortcomings
He's just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing

But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling

Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east

Hope lives on, if not through me through song
I'm getting the long, take deep breaths and hold on
I write like I realize I could be gone

I'm here, is the true meaning of love clear?
If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?

Some think men don't cry, well, here's tears
Been told all these lives for these years
It's unclear why truth is untold
But hold fast and truth will unfold

I know but it's kinda hard to believe
That a whole generation will die over greed
And that most of our young will die overseas
But it all remains to go unseen

Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe

We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow

Where I come from, I'm there for you, care for you
You don't have to worry I'm gonna always be there for you

Doing what, laying the foundation 'cause we gonna make it
But it's gonna take dedication

You know you'll always come first to me

Raheem,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Rain (Bridge),2007

To understand paying dues

What you know about having no car and rent being due and no bling bling
What you know about sacrificing all your wants for all your needs
What you know about loving your child, just to find out it ain't your seed

Until you know my joy, know my pain, and know my struggles
Until you've walked these shoes, paid my dues, and felt my troubles
Until you've shared my tears, known my fears, in all my years

What you know about hittin' that block and dodging them cops to make ends meet

Why go searching, else where lurking
When you been hurtin' for the real thing

Of love with a twist

Somewhere like that
Would you mind?
Would you mind? Sing

I was on I-95 on my way to Mickey D's
When my back right tire went flat
That's when this sexy little thing with a pearl tongue ring
Jumped out of a black Cadillac

Now she had a hourglass figure, no sign of a man
And all she said when she offered a ride was
Hey baby listen, you can ride on one condition
Act right when you get inside

Rubbin' and a touchin' on me
Then she stopped the car, told me to drive
'Cause she had a little trick from me to see

So I followed her directions to turn where she said
Not worryin' 'bout where we supposed to be

What's gangsta is knowledge

When you can't trust the priest

Guess the lies are easier to swallow
Than it is to face the truth

And look outs were guiding the police

We won't feel the need for change

Have some faith girl

You gotta lotta soul in your hips
The way you lean back
Break me off a piece of that Kit-Kat

I got a thing for chocolate (whoa)
I got a thing for sweets (whoa)
I might make you melt girl (whoa)
The way you dance to the beat (whoa)
Aw girl, (oh baby)I got a thing for chocolate (I got a thing for you, your sweetness)
A thang for sweets

Break me off a piece of that Kit-Kat baby
Ooh, uh, oh my Lord

Raheem DeVaughn,"Welcome to the Love Experience
A deep and tender, inevitable feeling of affection towards a person. 
Such as a rising kinship, recognizing attractive qualities, or a sense of undeniable oneness. 
So I propose a question to you:
Are you feeling loved today?",The Voice (Intro),2005
Raheem DeVaughn,"Should we just be friends, should we draw a line
Should we siege the times, take this thing further?
Or should we just pretend that love ain't closing in
Like I don't recognize, like you don't realize?

We're drawn to one another
Friends or lovers, it's time we choose
So fuck what your girls say and what my boys say
Don't even matter, all that matters now

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position,
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

To watch you fly away like doves do
And crush me, I need you
This air I breathe, like the tree's and leaves
We go together like hand in glove

So don't pretend that love ain't closing in
That I don't recognize that you don't realize
That were drawn to one another, friends or lovers
Girl, we gotta choose right now

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

I wanna take this further, I'm talkin' 'bout commitment
Our whole life, girl, I'm with it, I wanna put a title on this love
I hope you ain't feeling pressured but that just can't measure
To the way I feel about you and I love you
And I don't ever wanna let you go

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

Raheem DeVaughn,"Yo son, what the deal, son? What's really hood, son?
The word is bond, shit is real, shit is real
Yo son, this block is dead
Nigga need to go over here and pop off real quick
Yo, I gotta get that guap by all means
You know what I'm sayin', son?

Growin' up in Brooklyn, shit
I thought that everybody talked this way
Raised on Rakim and Run-DMC
So I thought that everybody 'Walked This Way'

We fresh, we chill, we def, we ill
It's just some things I was taught to say
And every Saturday morning
I watched cartoons with a bowl of Frosted Flakes

The puberty came, started hittin' them cuties with game
And the truancy came
Started cuttin' in just class, I was comin' all fast, I was new to game
Used to playin' on TV courtesy of video music box
Plus knew a lot of hustlas, goin' O.T., comin' back with the new hip hop

Like E-40 holding down the yay , N.W.A. in L.A.
OutKast from the A-Town, way down in Houston, they play the UGK
I walk and talk kinda fast and thought of as a New York kinda rhymer
But must New Yorkers got family in South and North Carolina

L.A. is little Alabama
They walk and they talk with a country grammar
And you think everybody else sound country
So they started callin' 'em Bamas

Down south where we buy them hammers
Down south where we sell them drugs
Down south where life is cheap
Where they quick to fill you with them slugs

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'
Want it simply put? You can't rip me
When I spit for the set, everyone free
I'ma underground king, nigga Pimp see free
Word up to my man Bun be, what?

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'
The things you bustin', the game you hustlin', the days you're cuttin'
The flame you cuffin' and the lames you snuffin', your name is nothin'

Growin' up in P.A., I knew nobody out there talked like us
Nothin' but that county slang, what up, dog? What up, cuzz?
Late night you see us guzzlin' 40's, menthols, wine and weed
Sittin' on the back porch, gettin' zooted, feelin' fine indeed

Listenin' to Eric Band, Rakim or EPMD
Cool see and Steady be, plus that Public Enemy
Not to mention N.W.A., DJ Quik and MC Eiht
Down south we listen to it all, we didn't discriminate

Then along came Geto Boys, Raheem and the Royal Flush
Rap-A-Lot Records based out in Houston, represents for us
OG style, they cars, ditch that 4 and too much trouble
Our squad is gangsta nigga, put it down for H-Town on the double

So I said it's time to hustle, got down with my brother see
Put together UGK and shit, the rest is history
We make hits by the dozen, put it down when they said we wasn't
Trust me it's nothin', just another day in the life for country cousins

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'
Want it simply put? You can't rip me
When I spit for the set, everyone free
I'ma underground king, nigga Pimp see free
Word up to my man Bun be, what?

It's nothin', I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin', you stay connected by the slang you bustin'
The things you bustin', the game you hustlin', the days you're cuttin'
The flame you cuffin' and the lames you snuffin', your name is nothin'

In Brooklyn, New York, I'm down with Large and Marl
Back in P.A.T., man, we be sippin' the barre
I'm down with J from Houston and I think it should be
But when I'm out in L.A., I fuck with Ice-T

$hort Dog is my OG, we been down forever
Taught me the game, lane to lane, and keep my pimpin' together
Niggaz don't understand by far back in the day
It was 'mazin' and my brother put me up on Black Star

Start as blacks off the news, I weighed
'Cause we isolate ourselves and give our ghetto pass away
My niggaz passed away in an unreal way
They mommas' depleted
I'm just tryna make sure that their kids straight

I'm on the Chitalin tour with my mic in my hand
Shittin' on these jealous niggaz in the new world clan
I wouldn't trade it for nothin', only a crazy man would
I represent for the whole south, I made it just for my hood
The pimpin's good

I got cousins, country cousins
Like blood that's thicker than water, down dirty 'cross the border
I got cousins, country cousins
Like blood that's thicker than water, down dirty 'cross the border
In my country cousins
",Country Cousins,2007
Raheem DeVaughn,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Rain (Bridge),2007

Sometimes I got it figured out, sometimes I'm confused
I win 9 times out of 10 but now and then I might lose

A playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
She gon' hold me down to the fullest, rainy or sunny

I love the fact that you don't need me to make you whole
Doin' it fast or takin' it slow, you know when to let me take control

Answer the phone and you hope to hear her voice
Ooh, you know you're lovesick when ya
Shut it down & make that girl your only choice
Ooh, lovesick when
When you wake up in the morning (just to fix her breakfast)
And I'll tell you how you know, your heart'll tell you so
When you found something good, you just can't let it go

One might spend a whole lifetime
Tryin' to find, the love that I have here with you
My heart & my... Speaks for you
Without you I'd be lovesick and empty (I'd be empty without ya)
Love, so empty (ooh, so empty without ya)

When you get on bended knee and words come out like marry me
Ooh, yes, you know you found the one
When the seconds feel like heaven in the blink of an eternity

When there's no thought of time and she's always on your mind
Ooh, you know you found the one
When you wanna be a better man, and man up like you can

Damn woman, you sweet sticky thing

I am drenched in your wetness so this kool-aid smile 
Can change the attitude of gratitude that you would even let this happen
And thanks for not snapping when our rapping didn't reflect your worth
So this is me tapping into your maple syrup and letting each drip
Drop into my mouth so I skip downtown and slip down south 
This way I can sip me some flow 
From the mouth of your mighty mississippi until I am tipsy
Or till there's none left and if done right
You'll mention malik and god in one breath
I love you to death, nah I love you to life
Love of my life, love you as my wife
I don't even need a number to call you
Sister, goddess, baby, momma, so blessed that you are my baby momma

But woman you defy physics you crib out west but stay on the tip of my tongue

Popped a boner, like what

I said, 'Nah, baby girlfriend, you ain't got to do that'
I hope you ain't the anorexic type trying to lose that.
Us boys like 'em thick short weaves curls braids

Boats cruise wardrobe flights everything's paid
If I'm aggressive just pardon my gangsta
I just wanna get to know you
Get to show the way I move that's part of my gangsta
Like art yo I can sit you down and paint cha

I'm alright, just that the baby's kicking I want some popeye chicken
And my back kinda hurts from the way I was sitting

And I need some, don't be fresh girl
You know I can't help it baby but stay away girl
Yeah, that's my joy, love, strawberry shortcake

When I can't event walk straight

Grown nigga like me let his thing blaze for that

Raheem DeVaughn,"This is a story of a player from the Island
That lost his way, such a price to pay
To, kiss those girls and make them cry
Kiss those girls and make them cry
To love, to lose, to plead for a do over
A do over, give me a do over, I want a do over
It's that Radio Raheem and Ghostface Killah

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend
Cheated on my girl til we nearly stopped speaking
She broke down and cried, and it hurts so bad
Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad
Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag
My excuses, I couldn't cum like that
She warned me of days like this, if this should happen
She'll be out, and we'll be the ones, sharing the napkin
Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions
Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing
But brought to the world, innocent, two month old
Little girl, but what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo
It's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew
Throwing the baby up to someone I hardly knew
Nah that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

Aiyo, I wrote this right here, on the bus to Riker's
Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers
For mad years, you held you down, I'mma overwhelmed in pain
And the worst time to leave you, now
I'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me
I appreciate your concern and support for me
Most important, your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible
This the truth spilling out of my guts
If I, would of took the chance to see
What was place right in front of my face
For sure, nine out of ten times
My accent's wouldn't allow me to be so naive
And blind, to carry out these mistakes
I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun
For me, my rep on the streets like touching a son
You like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you
Thanks for your patience, you find a man, I hope it's true

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block
Throwing out my Timbos, and all my clothes
She said, if my, apologies
She said, the lost won't fit those
And I said, baby, now let me explain
I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing
So take all the time you need in this life
And if you let me do it over, I promise to do it right

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time

Now who's really gangsta and tell me who's frontin'
Murder your sons, ravage your daughters
Here overseas and across the waters

Inject your land with guns and AIDS

Turn on the news
Ride through the hood
I witness the blues
How can you ignore it
It's easy to spot it
A trap house, a liquor store and your city's got it
And my city's got it, and their city's got it
This world is chaotic
And love is symbolic
So life don't get cherished,
So our babies perish, and your babies perish
Now tell me who's careless
Now who should I pray to
What should I pray for
You can't pay the preacher for your redemption
I know where we're headed
I already read it
The good book done said it (like cowboys and Indians)

But today I promise if we don't make our own way
Somebody'll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, lord help me please
Cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I'm bulletproof cocking the glock and aim n shoot
My future's ever clear 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of betta' days
Dreaming of betta' pay,
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta' pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep,
But if I die I pray the lord my soul to keep

And let nature take its course
Just like that I'm in the palm of her hand
Like a mike in the stand
Turn us up if y'all don't hear me

You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war

And everybody has an angle
And everybody wants tomorrow right now

Some say that happiness will never find you
Until you find yourself
Some say that happiness is all around you
It ain't how you measure your wealth
No, I say it's free to be yourself

It costs nothing
It costs nothing, to help sometimes

Like a morning without the sun
Like a home without the run
Galaxies without the stars
Jupiter, Earth and Mars
Like cupid without a bow, without an arrow, without a name
Like a groom standing on an alter without a bride to take his name
Like a yacht with no water to sail
Like a wish with no wishing well
What's a ruler without it's throne
With no queen to call it home

What's a man without his Woman? Nothing
What's a sky without blue? Nothing, nothing

I'm nothing without you
(I'm nothing without you)
I'm nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
Just nothing without you
Your are the half to my whole
Nothing without you
Nothing

Baby there ain't no way that I could even do one day
Without you, I mean nothing without you
Baby there ain't no face that ever could replace your space
Without you, without you
Baby I'd be, I'd be hollow inside
I'd be a lonely knight
I'd be a lonely king of the throne
(Just nothing without you)
I'd be an empty house that's calling home
A well dressed groom with no whole bride
A beating heart with no love inside
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, without you
Without you
Without you, without you, without you
I'd be

Mighty mighty Magnolia

I was sittin' up under these trees
She was talkin' to me, said
""Son do you know who I am? Who I happen to be?""
And I told her, ""The Might Magnolia that stand tall 
for the shoulders of slaves and soldiers when the days get colder""
I'm so older but I'm young in my spirit
From the blood I'd hear it
From Mr. Malcom Garvey and Marley
Then she started to tell me
How she was used in the lynching of blacks
Branch cracked, broke her arms so his neck would snap
And if I wouldn't rap I'd probably meet the same damn fate
From the same damn rope, I'm 'bout the same damn weight
I said, ""Wait man, wait""
I still got the nooses just loose and they tighten that bitch up
When I'm speakin' the truth
They need proof that God exist
So I gave The God Box
It ain't shit hard as this, it ain't shit hard as this
Flick a wrist, I flick a brick

May the sky start cryin'
As they hung lifeless from your arms
Please Mother Magnolia
Although the fruit is strange
It's been such a long time comin'
But will the seasons ever change?

Let me try to offer ya'll a whole 'nother perspective really quick
Now this African American officer was an undercover
He lost a little brother because of a gang color
Which eventually accelerated the cancer that killed his mother
And he was married to a white woman that they called a nigga lover
And it became a full time job not to kill a nigga
I wonder does he still consider that he's still a nigga
We all got choices, and the real recognize what's real and chose
But he's basically still undercover in his civilian clothes
All the right reasons
But he may not even get that love again
'Cause salary's still not enough to be a Republican
Issues of growin' up without a dad
Had 1 too many one night and forgot his badge
A brawl ensued with a racist cop
Didn't stop and ask
He was sure that he was a nigga when he shot his ass

Oh Mother Magnolia
Your daughters and your sons
May the sky start cryin'
As they hung lifeless from your arms
Please Mother Magnolia
Although the fruit is strange
It's been such a long time comin'
But will the seasons ever change?

If a tree could speak
It's probably shed a tear and weep
For the skin like mine
For being there behind Confederate lines

I've seen streets we're youth are forced to take the long way home
And I've seen mothers mourn the loss of there only born
Still I believe we are given nothin more than we can beg
A vision is only blurred when life seems unfair

Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When he's just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fast paced pipe dreams and shortcomings
He's just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing

Its like we damned if we do and damned if we don't
And it's a very thin line between respect and being broke

And being one red button away from world war three
Always called the minority
And always always pulled over
Facing police brutality
Why is every street a living hell
Probably cause they want us to fail
Yeah three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slave ships when they sail

[Verse 2]
Years and years of civil rights chasing to pass that bill
But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling
In this concrete jungle

One check away from starvation, poverty
But they say being free is about speaking your mind
Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east

If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?

Put off 'til tomorrow what we'd really rather do tonight
And later realize

Time passes by, people pass on
At the drop of a tear, they're gone
Let's do what we dare, do what we like
And love while we're here before time passes by

Thoughts are like pennies we keep in our pockets
They're never worth nothing 'til we give them away
But love's like a promise in an un-opened letter
Where nights full of pleasure seldom see the light of day
When life gets in the way

Time passes by, people pass on
At the drop of a tear, they're gone
Let's do what we dare, do what we like
And love while we're here before time passes by

At the drop of a tear, they're gone

And love while we're here before time passes by",Time Passes By,2000
Rahel,"Let your love flow down
Let it fall to the ground

Is keep on reaching through

Rahkua,"I'm not a perfect person, man
Neither is my life
But Jeremiah 29:11 tells me that God has a plan for me (yeah)
It may not be where I am right now
But what I do know is that 
It will be greater than I ever imagined
Because I believe, I believe

I used to read revelations, scared and frightened
Prepared for the thunder and lightning
My fear was tightening
It was clear that any year could be the year that Christ would
Return and affirm that he was the fair and righteous, uh
All I kept hearing was keep preparin', keep your faith, keep your bearings
Don't be left out

Every Sunday up in the church
Every Sunday puttin' in work
I remember that 

Hearin' the word, confirmin' my walk
Annointin' my voice
Confirmin' his talk
I'm a saved man

As time goes by
Be not deceived
Be led by the Holy Spirit and keep the belief
'Cause I do, I do, I do
Yeah, 'cause I do, I do, I do
Uh I believe

I'm giving you the glory (I'm giving you the glory)
I'm giving you the glory, Lord
I'm giving you the glory, Lord
When I praise your name 

You, you (you, you, you) 
Give me the victory
Give me the victory, Lord
You give me the victory, Lord

God I love you like you love me
I know I can do all things 
Through you like it should be
'Cause I believe, I believe, I believe
'Cause I believe, I believe, I believe

Sometimes it's hard to believe when nothing is right
When everything in your life seems to be causin' you strife
Takin' your wheel, takin' your might, takin' your soul
Takin' your fight, that's the plight of a Christian
The twists and turns, shifts and burns
Can leave you hopeless of his return
Stay the course now 
Don't be afraid to let the gift we earn
Be the gift that keeps you firm, with no remorse

Blessed are those that wait for his help
But also make a way for yourself
Meet him halfway
The kingdom of God will have your place
All you gotta do is rely on your faith
Yeah, like I do, I do, I do (mmm)
Yeah, like I do, I do, I do (I do, I do oh oh oh)

'Cause I believe
I=I-I'm giving you the glory (I'm giving you the glory)
I'm giving you the glory, Lord
I'm giving you the glory, Lord
When I praise your name 

You, you (you, you, you, you) 
Give me the victory
Give me the victory, Lord (we got the victory)
You give me the victory, Lord

Every day I wake (every day I wake up)

Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two

Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1998
Rahsaan Roland Kirk,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,1998
Rahsaan Roland Kirk,"you wouldn't forget him either 
if you met im where i met him
talkin about desolation
desolation isi sraliorad station round about a 2am a\on w week night
you walk into desolation like that and suddenly out of nowhere comes a warm song you aren't about to forget it
thisis the first ime i've heard him at the airport
i know he moves along th epiers
he calls himself a journey agent
a eulipion
syas hi freinds the poets and the artists adn the musicians are eulipions 
too
listen to his tune
he calls it the duty free gift for the traveller

if there were no song
you would have this song
to give warmth at night
and to keep you strong
it would make love a guess
spinning round and round
and when meteors fall
love would reach the ground
if there were no moon
to control the tides
there would be these notes
as the sail goes by
we woudl make song??
and the praises soft
on the offer of love
may you live it out

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Feel the beat drop jazz and hip-hop
Drippin' in your dome makes you zone and bop 
Funk and fusion a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm ya cruisin' 
Up down round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless you've got to get down 
Fantasy freak through the beat so unique
You move your feet and sweat from the beat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhyme some will call me a poet
Poem steady flowin', growin' showin' sights and sounds
Caught in the groove in the tale I found
Many tripped the tour upon the rhymes they saw
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya

Jump to the jam boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sound of th mighty mic master
Rhymin' on the mic I'll bring the suckers to disaster
Bookout ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, a star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble

E smoke a bone the size of a fibula 
Prepare for the slaughter, the lyrical marauder 
Unfreakable acts like me and your daughter, did 
I be coughin' layin' in the coffin 
Step out the fantasy world you be lost in 
Dead man walkin', engage you hawkin' 

From Pensauken to Vienna 
I be me and a slew to combat your crew 
With acrobatics only seen in cartoons 
Like the Go-ad Rucker, double-pumped ya 
Puncture, vocally rupture, puff a cluster 
Ambidextrous, both sides test this 
Removin' wackness like asbestos

Yo check it out, yo. 
From cranadle to cradle and able to print 
I'm so deep that dirt's at my naval, my table submit 
You audio/video vaginal, lines imagine a magnitudes 
That give longitude and latitude some attitudes 

From an environment, freestyle's a requirement 
Upon every album, that my parents had to hide the rent 
If my demise commence unexpectantly, just test my pee 
I bet you see ecstasy or some obscenity inject in me (what else?) 
I flood your airways, place planes in jeopardy 
Flights vanish, panic deputies, expectancy for jet debris 
Let it be, and commence the record to play 
I'm so ahead of my time when I talk there's a seven second delay 
Don't judge a book by its cover when I'm inventin' 
I add your colon to my sentence, and start to pluck off on your appendix 
Dexterity hurled is about to rally the world 
You can't write without using like, what are you some type of valley girl? 
At open mics, I'm tellin' y'all one last time 
Stop askin' for a capellas and then kickin' those wack rhymes, flat line 
what, yo-yo-yo

I'm accustomed to abiding by freestyle penal code 
My rhymes are like long drives going down a scenic road 
Taught discipline through paragraphs, walk back streets and narrow paths 
My kicks look dirty and pants sag like I have no ass! 
Flippin' styles that'd pioneered in the Space Age 
Writin' your first paragraph, I'm already on my eighth page 
For the way you write your rhymes, I could tell you never really made grades 
Going through life miserable, hatin' yourself on payday 
A pleasant plea, Thirstin in parentheses 
I heard a mute man mention me to a blind woman on Vescey Street 
Urged to leave gats alone in memory of Pumpkin and Faster Poem 
Wouldn't want my moms to identify me with half the dome! 
A toast, with high price gangrere 
Battle the best motherfuckers and whoever they bring here 
Long term, sought through rations 
I even put freestyle under special skills when submitting application 
Flows, that can't be followed by asthma patients 
Got a death wish? Here's his extension, ask for Satan 
The rap languages me and more, findin' subjects in Singapore 
Impressin' MC's who swore to God they'd seen it all

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

Weighing in at an even 215 pounds

Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X

All I know
That's a bad motherfucker
All I know
He's about to drop some shit now

When I first came out, many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name
Rahzel, now rewind that, (Gargling) slow it down, you'll find that
the way I design that, and reverb behind that, not in my contract
I'm bustin all over this bitch, while your girl cums
Down with the Two-One-Fifth, Illadelph, Dy-Nast'
are-double-O-T-S, no need to remind us
You're far behind us, tryin to high beam, blind us
Catching shinas from a nickle plated niner (Gun sounds)
Blastin' holes in your designers
This is for you primadonnas
cause my persona's like pirhannas
I got you second guessin and sweatin like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson, no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
God damn it feel good to see people up on it

Chorus

[Rahzel]
Who's the man, Rahzel's the +Man+, so yo, pass the +Method+
1200 styles, crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my, vocabulary, vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics, I can jam like automatics
Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is DAN-JUR
Number five in the Billboard, with the bullet
One million, in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it
cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harrass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine, octane, because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet, on-you-son, like I'm NASA

Kids doin the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death, what the doctor ordered, so say, ""Ahhh""

see'est la vie, I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP
Check the outlets for cassettes and CD

I just got home from off another world tour 
I'm outside  in the rain  it's beginnin' to pour 
Can't understand why you changed the locks on the door 
Got all my drawers and socks outside on the lawn
 
What's right is wrong, we used to make love to this song 
Twice as long, especially when the nights were long 
Suga even in the dark, or when the lights were on 
Sista even in the park, lover my life is gone
 
I saw the flaws, now we both grabbin' for straws 
Over some love letters you found, in the top dresser drawer 
I'm missin' you more, the sweet scent of Christian Dior 
Kissin' you more, forever promissin' you more 
We need to communicate and start listenin' more 

Baby from experience, I've been through it before 
I found the message in a bottle washed up on the shore 
Signed from, 'sincerely yours', I can't take it no more 

[Chorus: ]
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista 
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista

Another episode, had the keys to the Yukon 
Tried to call her on the celly but she didn't respond 
Had my finger on redial now I'm callin' her moms 
Kept gettin' the voicemail now I'm losin' my calm
 
Though she's probably with the next man, wrapped in his arms 
Probably caught up in the mix, where she didn't belong 
On the topic of trust, misgivings was leading me wrong 
On the topic of us, misgivings was treating me wrong 

Reading me wrong, now we not getting along 
You never miss a good thing baby until it is gone 
The thrill is gone, you can hear my heart, spill on this song 

Wishin' once upon a time could stand still on this song 
If the feelings is strong, then a countermove would be wrong 
If the feelings is gone, then you know it's time to move on 
If the feelings is torn, then I was right all along 
If you think that I'm wrong, then pick my drawers off the lawn 

[Chorus: ]

At first I came to a halt, it was your fault 
Had me frozen on the avenue just watchin' you walk 
Up in your presence I was caught, breath, becomin' short 
I had to step to this to let you know you had my support
 
I said, ""I'm Black Thought, from out the 2-1-5th 
Maybe you heard about the Dynasty I do run with 
Me and The Roots done ripped, from Illadel' across the planet 
Ya see, we on some shit some find it hard to understand it
 
But back, to what you all about or how you are at 
What type of science did you knowledge was your mental intact?"" 
To converse, at first, let me know you knew the day and time 
I had to catch you, mentally makin' you mine
 
While I'm lookin' at you, physical chiseled that of a statue 
Type of shit to make you travel from Philly to the Big Apple 
It feels kind of crazy, reminiscin' back through 
No need to sweat the backturnin', keep it on the true and actual
 
As I get into your thought, for all infinity 
Shower you in masculinity, reinforcin' your sense 
Of femininity, bless you with this, the true identity 
Nothin' but respect in your vicinity 

Since, the Suga Brown from the level of Foun-dation of ground 
So together we forever bound 
We could make, heavenly sounds like a musical blend 
Throughout the bad times and beautiful things, it's like that

Artistry since constipated 
Nowadays we're with Rahzel, we're glad we waited 
Now we got you, right in the spot where we want it 
And every single negative vibe is confronted 
It's kinda ill when you let your music go free flowin 
Buildin' on improvised grounds and still growin 
People work hard, some want to escape 
But yo we gotta face the music with ease and with grace 
Sometimes we look to jams for an inner inspiration 
Cause the lyrics and the rhythm are the music vibrations 
Makin things gel like a compound equation 
Mad sounds culminatin' for one sensation

Give me a Break, my man is phat like Nell Carter 
With a brother like the on top with the willy 
We the illy, he's phildeplh we the rusaphilly 
It's a thunderous move like a herd of elephants 
And it sounds real raw cause we in our element 
Like natural, never catch these kids on sabbatical 
Always up front tryin to give you what you want 
You see it's very crucial that we stand and deliver 
Always tryin to rise above and be a good figure 
And we hopin that you diggin on the rhymes that we wrote 
Better get yourself together, let's flow, come on

Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn

Keep the models following wise as King Solomon

All the way to New Orleans and everything in between

But hold your head black or I'll never rap again

Every tours a war and I'm on the road again
Surprise a town the place it's live and loud

[Everlast]
Once upon a time not long ago
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
and people were behaving' like they ought to: good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
and this is what he said
""Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash
robbing' old folks and making' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""keep still, boy, no need for static""
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
the kid pulled out a gun
He said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good in expectations
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left
he was running' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dad, the dope fiend shooting' dope
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
he dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night!

We take it higher

Yo, yo
My little daughter, started, nursery school
Brother com, gotta make our move through
The stylist and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After, traveling the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya, back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breaking off
I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off
D be like, we ain't got no time for that!
Questlove said, we ain't got no time for that!
My old bird like, we ain't got no time for that!
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
We're in to win with hen's and heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
To seek and peak cause pete, shit gets deep

With penitentiary talk, coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killing 'em soft
Dealing with golf, getting blowed on the course
I be dissing magazines, but then buy the source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down, like bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is beat street in backpacks
Bragging how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land

Rahzel,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair

Rahzel,"Ah…

I want you to know that I am the man who
Fight for the right, not for the wrong
Going there, I'm growing there
Helping the weak against the strong

Soon you will find out the man I'm supposed to be

Help this man, don't trouble no man
But if you trouble that man it will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam

See that?

Rahzel,"Those haunting rhymes are keeping the time,
but they'll never get through to me.
It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it.
It's my party, there's no one but me in the corner.
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

Now roll it up and smoke it again.
Now light me up and snort it again.
Now fix it up and shoot it again.
I can't believe I did it again.

Keep haunting me, taunting me,
but they'll never get through to me

It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it
My party, there's blood on the ceiling, the carpet
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

Now roll it up and smoke it again.
It's bottoms up and drink it again.
Now fix it up and shoot it again.
I can't believe I did it again.

I'm readin' the signs, makes me wonder why they're getting through to me.

Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name

You're far behind us, tryin to high beam, blind us
Catching shinas from a nickle plated niner (Gun sounds)
Blastin' holes in your designers

Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer

Who's the man, Rahzel's the +Man+, so yo, pass the +Method+

Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is DAN-JUR
Number five in the Billboard, with the bullet
One million, in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it
cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harrass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine, octane, because I gassed ya

Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP

Put the tape on, I can take on any shape, form 
Size or weight, shape of Activation Voltron

Imagine the next MC step to me gettin' shitted on 
You can even ask the girl about the bed we did it on 
I hit it from the back to Marvin Gaye's 'Let's Get it On'
Don't get it wrong, give it a thong, she put it on, in uniform 
Sippin' Don Perignon, Shawn Don, fillet mignon

Until the cameras are gone from there on, dusk till dawn

Twice as long, especially when the nights were long 
Suga even in the dark, or when the lights were on

I saw the flaws, now we both grabbin' for straws 
Over some love letters you found, in the top dresser drawer 
I'm missin' you more, the sweet scent of Christian Dior 
Kissin' you more, forever promissin' you more 
We need to communicate and start listenin' more

On the topic of us, misgivings was treating me wrong 

Reading me wrong, now we not getting along 
You never miss a good thing baby until it is gone

I had to catch you, mentally makin' you mine

Type of shit to make you travel from Philly to the Big Apple 
It feels kind of crazy, reminiscin' back through 
No need to sweat the backturnin', keep it on the true and actual

Shower you in masculinity, reinforcin' your sense 
Of femininity, bless you with this, the true identity 
Nothin' but respect in your vicinity

Buildin' on improvised grounds and still growin 
People work hard, some want to escape 
But yo we gotta face the music with ease and with grace 
Sometimes we look to jams for an inner inspiration 
Cause the lyrics and the rhythm are the music vibrations 
Makin things gel like a compound equation 
Mad sounds culminatin' for one sensation 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

Lights, camera, action, get it on 
Watch the beatbox as he lets the sound form 
Ain't nobody iller than my man Rahzel 
So you other beat machines don't stress and get gel 
A very short suggestion is you go and work harder 
Give me a Break, my man is phat like Nell Carter 
With a brother like the on top with the willy 
We the illy, he's phildeplh we the rusaphilly 
It's a thunderous move like a herd of elephants 
And it sounds real raw cause we in our element 
Like natural, never catch these kids on sabbatical 
Always up front tryin to give you what you want 
You see it's very crucial that we stand and deliver 
Always tryin to rise above and be a good figure 
And we hopin that you diggin on the rhymes that we wrote 
Better get yourself together, let's flow, come on 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow

[Everlast]
Once upon a time not long ago
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
and people were behaving' like they ought to: good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
and this is what he said
""Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash
robbing' old folks and making' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""keep still, boy, no need for static""
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
the kid pulled out a gun
He said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good in expectations
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left
he was running' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dad, the dope fiend shooting' dope
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
he dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night!

Yo, yo

Brother com, gotta make our move through
The stylist and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After, traveling the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya, back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breaking off
I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off

My old bird like, we ain't got no time for that!

We're in to win with hen's and heineken's

With penitentiary talk, coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killing 'em soft
Dealing with golf, getting blowed on the course
I be dissing magazines, but then buy the source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down, like bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is beat street in backpacks
Bragging how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land

I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam

Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough

Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son

Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want

Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice

Smack your head up against the wall

If ya don't well then forget it

Und ich drück' den Knopf, mit dem das Öl tropft
Und der Hebel für die Nägel wird gezogen, das Blech wird verbogen

Said that I was bad for you.

Down a long dark avenue.

Felice senza un motivo.
Ma come ogni cosa quando la si idealizza
Prima o poi ti anestetizza
E non sai bene cosa sia né quando inizia
Come un bar mitzvah
In vita mio ho avuto modo di incontrare e conoscere mille persone
Ed è solo una garanzia di delusione
La gente parla chissà come
Qua basta poco e si cambia la faccia Ranma Saotome
Devo pensare a come andare via
Trovare un modo per farti di nuovo mia.
Beata gioventù beata l'incoscienza
Figli del caso non della provvidenza
Siamo con e siamo senza
Prendiamo fuoco ammanettati all'uscita di emergenza.
E tu vorresti dare un senso
Ma io non so più dare penso
Succede di sentirsi perso
Specie la mattina presto come adesso.

E' buia la città (cammino tra le anime stanche)
Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante.

Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante.

Qualcuno ha detto che la vita non ti carica
Mai di un peso troppo grande da sopportare
Tutte palle per quanto tu abbia le spalle larghe
Capita che non sia proporzionale poi ti scarica le batterie
Ci sono anche per l'anima le malattie
Non basteranno le poesie e gli aforismi dei saggi
Per sollevarti 21 grammi sono troppi anche per i giganti
In un angolo con mezzo fondo di beluga
Mi perdo come nel triangolo delle bermuda
La 8 in buca partita chiusa
Abbiamo mille vie d'accesso ma una sola via di fuga
E penso a quando tutto era più leggero
Più del cielo
Ma ad essere sincero ero
Io che lo reggevo anche se oggi non mi sembra vero.
E tu vorresti dare un senso
Ma io non so più dare penso
Succede di sentirsi perso
Specie la mattina presto come adesso.

E' buia la città (cammino tra le anime stanche)
Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante.

Allora c'è un perché a questa mia confusione
Ho la testa in subbuglio,
Il frigo vuoto io pure io e questa casa ormai siamo tutt'uno
Se ciò che abbiamo è ciò che siamo,
Io sono un divano, un lampadario, una tv e un centinaio di libri,
Perché chi non legge non immagina
E chi non immagina non è di carne è di plastica
Sono arrivato qui con tutti i miei sogni abbastanza,
Da vivere tre vite in tre mondi
E avevo fame, fame come un cane
Abbastanza da far male, abbastanza da sbranare
Ma che ne sa, un cane della libertà
Lui giura fedeltà, comunque vada resta qua
Dietro la staccionata e se arriva un estraneo abbaia
Per paura non per rabbia

Il tempo, cambia,
Gli uomini come il vento,
Piega, gli alberi
Questa città ne è la riprova
Perché anche se è così grande
In giro hanno tutti le stesse facce
Le borse sotto agli occhi, scavati nelle guance gonfi,
Di speranze perché ciò che non ricordi non ti tange
Ma qui abbiamo aperto le danze
Bambina usciamo a fare quattro passi come un Valzer,
Tra un istante

Ho scelto di gettarmi tra le fiamme,
Perché ho le palle, come uno stunt-man
Ma forse il mio talento non è grande

È come se ci fossimo imbucati alla festa tra,

Dove rischi di arrivare
Ho messo tutti i chilometri che potevo,
Io lo sapevo e no, io non volevo
Andare avanti e lasciarmi il cuore lì dietro

Nemmeno ai titoli di coda

Cade la pioggia fitta finché cade il cielo
Scoppia il soffitto e io qui seduto che annego

Non smettevamo finché il sole non scendeva
Bastava poco, realmente poco
I pensieri di un bambino sanno colorare il vuoto

Non esisteva il verbo instagrammare,
Facevamo foto, io se chiudo gli occhi forte ancora lo ricordo
Mamma in casa col vestito nuovo
Papà in garage con le mani sporche d'olio, aggiusta la moto

Noi guardavamo rocky e ci picchiavamo
Per chi doveva esser rocky, prima di mettere i guantoni
Pranzo a casa dei nonni la domenica
Quando l'hai scoperto l'amore non si dimentica!
Le ferie giù in Sicilia, d'estate, al paese dove zia fa ancora il pane
Sorridevamo quando ancora sapevamo perdonare
Pensavamo che nulla potesse mai cambiare

Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare che comunque vada ovunque andrai
Sarai parte di me ed ogni volta che,
Impossibile, io penso a noi per non dimenticare mai

Così poco, giusto il letto e qualche gioco
Poi casa si fa grande e papà c'è sempre meno

C'è sempre qualche aereo

Diventiamo grandi per necessità
Ma non siamo
All'altezza di quello che viviamo

Adesso insegnagli a sorridere, a perdonare
e a pregare perchè nulla possa mai cambiare

Più dell'amore in coppia, com'è l'amore in gruppo

Sembra quasi una formula
Ma, qualcosa non va, non va

Scrivo di me,
Perché a parlarne sono meno bravo,
Se no col Rap manco ci provavo
Quando ho iniziato c’era spirito di aggregazione
E mi sentivo libero, immaginazione
Sta roba della musica era un salvagente

Guardo i miei dischi e la mia vita mi passa davanti
In un niente come prima di un incidente
Uh, mi sono fatto da me, mi sono fatto uomo,
E nessuno mi ammazza se non mi ammazzo da solo
Come Kurt Cobain, ora che mi servi dove cazzo sei
Vado a letto tardi, mi alzo presto e dormo poco
Perché quando chiudo gli occhi comincia di nuovo
Sogno che cado nel vuoto senza fermarmi o schiantarmi
La maledizione di un eterno volo

Ammazzo il tempo ma alla fine lui mi ucciderà
Ogni secondo ogni momento è l’ultima chance
La gente che c’è qua,
Pensa di avere tutta la verità
Ma c’è qualcosa che nessuno sa
Tranne me (qualcosa che nessuno sa tranne me)
(Tranne me)

Faccio l’artista ho sempre voluto farlo
Uso la sinistra come il diavolo, come Picasso
Mai avuto una bella grafia,
Curavo solo il contenuto, solo contro tutti
Lontano dai cliché,
Come un asceta scrivo come nessuno su questo pianeta
E non aspetto che mi ammazzi il tempo
Qui nessuno mi dà ciò che merito, quindi me lo prendo
Quanto è difficile vivere facendo canzoni
Ma io non cerco scuse trovo soluzioni
Ho fatto i dischi senza mega produzioni
Tu fai schifo pure coi milioni, 47 Ronin
E mia madre sorride, quando vede la mia faccia in 16:9
Nelle trasmissioni
Ma è ciò che trasmetto nelle canzoni
A renderla fiera di me tutti i giorni, tutti i giorni

Ammazzo il tempo ma alla fine lui mi ucciderà
Ogni secondo ogni momento è l’ultima chance
La gente che c’è qua,
Pensa di avere tutta la verità ma c’è qualcosa che nessuno sa
Tranne me (qualcosa che nessuno sa tranne me)
(Tranne me)

A casa mia siamo schiavi come Once Were Warriors
Io come i miei avi ho solo palle e orgoglio
Voglio andare da mia madre con sei buste della Coop
Piene di pezzi da cento
E farle sorridere gli occhi,
Malinconica come mio nonno quando suonava l’armonica
Oggi la retorica ci gonfia come bodyguard
Ma i sani stanno solo in Paradiso e a Nova Gorica
Io non scrivo stronzo, ti faccio il film in testa
Scegliti un posto prenditi i popcorn
Pensi di saperne molto
Ma sul mio conto è più quello che non vedi come un soft porno
Non ho mai provato a mettere tutti d’accordo,
Con la musica che faccio o con quello che racconto
Finché rappo (come rappo),
Lebron Raige io vi schiaccio, tutti, sotto

Per come parli della verità
Sembra quasi una formula
Ma, qualcosa non va, non va",Nessuno,2014
Raige,"Finalmente libero da quelle facce di merda
Adesso volo Icaro a quattro spanne da terra
Mi hanno tenuto appeso per un anno una tortura
Ma alla fine, ciò che non mi uccide me lo suca
Alex Andrea Vella nessuno più lo ferma
Se Dio vuole, e se non vuole pazienza
Non ho mai perso tempo, non ho mai perso il tempo

Tu sfrutti il momento e sto momento sta finendo
Chiariamo il punto, sono partito col mio gruppo
Che eravamo in tutto, meno dei reduci di Woodstock
Se adesso siamo centinaia, di migliaia,
Lo devi sopratutto al Rap di classe operaia
Vengo da Torino la Detroit italiana
Quindi non fare il figo non sei Tony Montana
Sembri più Hannah Montana,
Ti schiaccio quando rappo come in NBA
Puoi chiamarmi Lebron Raige

Sedici barre dieci metriche, se dici me, dici Rap
Vedi che, gli altri qua le fanno tutte identiche
Lucidi le Jordan, lucida la corda
E poi lasciati andare a penzolare dalla porta
Si dai per carità, gioco un altro campionato la mia è serie A
Un minimo di serietà
Io sono il Baggio del Rap, guarda che tacco fra
Sono sua maestà, tu lustrami le scarpe sciuscià
Lei me lo sciuscia, madame, me gusta
Ho il genio nella lampo se solo ci si struscia
Una cattiva cera e una brutta, sbronza
Questa è la mia era la tua è c’era una volta
Il meglio del meglio in circolazione
Sono tutto flow e cattiva reputazione
Mi vedi ai live e fai, ma come fa
Io invece non ti vedo, Raige Charles

Raige,"Le panchine vuote, Facebook pieno
La tecnologia si muove, perdiamo terreno
Internet riduce le distanze
Parliamo con tutti dalle nostre stanze, ma le ampliate anche
Se mi affaccio sul pianerottolo non so il nome dei miei vicini
Se non fosse che i figli ascoltano rap e mi seguono sui social
Non saprei nemmeno il nickname di quei due bambini
Ci ostiniamo a vivere la vita degli altri
Che siano attori, calciatori o cantanti
Come se il mondo fosse tutto delle persone importanti
E noi sotto, piccoli e ignoranti
A conti fatti siamo tutti quanti politeisti
Nuove piramidi, antichi egizi
Più andiamo avanti più spegniamo il potenziale
Ma una stella per splendere ha bisogno di bruciare

Nel futuro breve più immediato
Il vero lusso è la felicità
Senza fiato, senza contatto
Con il cuore spaccato a metà
Io sono buono solamente a scrivere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa farei per vederti vivere

In questo nulla cosmico siamo granelli di sabbia
Attaccati a brandelli di speranza
Siamo fatti tutti della stessa sostanza
Al 70 per cento di acqua
Quindi se il sole fosse al posto di Giove
Brucerebbe le persone senza fare distinzione
Tra le ricche e le povere, sconosciute o famose
Senza nulla togliere, Darwin non aveva ragione
Siamo fermi al Medioevo con l’evoluzione
Lo sguardo verso il cielo cerca una soluzione
Ma a forza di guardare solo verso l’alto
Ci siamo dimenticati di ciò che succede in basso

Nel futuro breve più immediato
Il vero lusso è la felicità
Senza fiato, senza contatto
Con il cuore spaccato a metà
Io sono buono solamente a scrivere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa farei per vederti vivere

I giorni passano tutti uguali
Cambiano solo i numeri nei calendari
Dimentichiamo di essere speciali
Diventiamo stupidi, abitudinari
Diventiamo un’ arma, un’altra predica
Poi si guarda in alto, chi ci salverà?
Se le risposte piovessero, gli ombrelli sarebbero
Al contrario come per colpa del vento
Abbiamo i telescopi puntati sull’universo
E nemmeno una lente di ingrandimento per riuscire a guardarci dentro
Se il cielo si spegnesse tutto domani
E Dio dall’alto ci guardasse, noi saremmo li a nascondere
I nostri errori, il nostro essere umani
Pregando perché il mondo che conosciamo per corrompere
Non ci arriveremo neanche, lontanamente
A pensare che le luci elettriche
Viste al buio sono come le stelle
Viste da sopra sembrano come stelle
Sono come le stelle
Sono come le stelle

Nel futuro breve più immediato
Il vero lusso è la felicità
Senza fiato, senza contatto
Con il cuore spaccato a metà
Io sono buono solamente a scrivere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa farei per vederti vivere",Stelle,2014

Sarei capace di girare il mondo
Anche se il mondo finisse
Io tornerei come Ulisse

M hanno insegnato che in amore vince chi fugge
E quando c'hai una convinzione
Ti ci attacchi con le unghie
Infatti corro come Bolt
Sempre col cuore in gola
Non sai quanti padri in casa c'hanno una pistola
Io non volevo, finire impallinato
Come un trofeo in un salotto, un animale impagliato
Ma l'occasione, fa l uomo ladro
E da quando ti ho vista mi sento strano
Perche tutto cambiato

Se tu fossi stata qui dentro casa
Io quella porta non l'avrei aperta mai
È un dettaglio quando sei cominciata
Quello che conta è quanto continuerai

Sarei capace di girare il mondo
Anche se il mondo finisse
Se questa nave dovesse andare a fondo oppure il mare sparisse

Guardo nello specchio, mi devo riprendere
Nel mio quartiere ho una reputazione da difendere
Ma poi ti vedo scendere, in tiro per la sera
E più che uno sciupafemmine sembro un anima in pena
Chissa cos è che fai, chissa dov è che vai
Come è che quando ci incontriamo non mi parli mai
Sei sempre cosi seria, ma bella anche da seria,
Sei bella da arrabbiata insomma sei bella vera, bella mia!
Le provo tutte per farti mia

Parla di Penelope e della sua tela e di me stasera che

Raige,"Non so se lo ricordi
Per me è come se fosse oggi
Pioveva cosi forte che quasi non riuscivi ad aprire gli occhi
E abbiamo trovato riparo in centro
Le vetrine affianco, le luci dietro
E ci sembrava di essere a Londra
Uno stronzo e una stronza
Prima di allora era come se non ci fossimo mai toccati
Forse sfiorati come il cielo coi prati
Io ti ho preso la mano e ti ho detto andiamo
Nessuno ci da ciò che meritiamo
Noi ce lo prendiamo, non mi aspetto che mi credi, voglio che ti fidi
Corriamo il rischio di essere felici, che dici?
Se, se capitasse pure a noi di non aver paura
C’è differenza tra sollevarsi e volare abbi fiducia di me

In ogni attimo che c’è
In ogni attimo di me e di te
Fino a togliere l’ombra al sole su Londra, quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me

Non so se lo ricordi, per me è come se fosse oggi
Riconoscerei i tuoi occhi tra un milione di altri occhi
E mentre camminavamo nel centro ho avuto l’impressione che mi tenessi più stretto
Soli io e te a notte fonda, che ci fotte di Londra?

Prima di allora era come se non ci fossimo visti mai 
Ognuno troppo preso a pensare ai suoi guai
E allora tu ti sei fermata sbarrando la strada
Mi hai detto la fiducia non si presta, va data
Quindi se vuoi che io mi fidi togli la maschera
Sei molto meglio se sorridi

Se, se capitasse pure a noi di non aver paura
C’è differenza tra sollevarsi e volare
Abbi fiducia di me
In ogni attimo che c'è
In ogni attimo di me e di te
Fino a togliere l'ombra al sole su Londra, quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me

E tu mi hai visto con la forza di un vulcano
Gridare il mio coraggio fino a perdere il fiato
E poi mi hai visto piangere come un bambino 
Con la paura di perdere tutto, anche il respiro
Io ti ho vista con la forza di un vulcano 
gridare il tuo coraggio fino a perdere il fiato
E poi ti ho vista piangere, bambina
Con la paura di perdere tutto, come prima

Se, se capitasse pure a noi di non aver paura
C’è differenza tra sollevarsi e volare

Aveva mille donne se
Cantava Help, Ticket to Ride

Non suona la chitarra ma
Uno strumento
Che sempre dà

Non ha più fans

Raihan,"How great the wonder of the heaven
And the timeless beauty of the night
How great, then how great
The Creator

And its stars like priceless jewels
Far beyond the reach of kings
Bow down, for the shepherd
Guiding him home

But how many eyes are closed
To the wonder of this night
Like pearls hidden deep
Beneath the dark stream of desires

But like dreams vanished with the call to prayer
And the dawn extinguishes night
Here too are signs
God is the Light, God is the Light

How great the beauty of the earth
And the creatures who dwell on her
How great, then how great
The Creator

As its mountains pierce the clouds
High above the lives of man
Weeping rivers
For thousands of years

But how may hearts are closed
To the wonders of this sight
Like birds in a cage
Asleep with closed wings

But like works stops with the call to prayer
And the birds recite
Here too are signs
God is the Light, God is the Light

How great the works of man
And the things he makes
How great, then how great
The Creator

Though he strives to reach the heavens
He can barely survive
The wars of the world
He lives in

Yet how many times he's tried
Himself to immortalize
Like his parents before him
In the garden of Eden

But like the sun sets with the call to prayer
And surrenders to the night
Here to are signs

Se você sempre faz de mim o que bem quer
Se ao teu lado sei tão pouco de você

Mas eu disfarço o meu ciúme mesmo assim
Pois aprendi que o meu silêncio vale mais
E desse jeito eu vou trazer você pra mim

E como um prêmio, eu recebo o teu abraço
Subornando o meu desejo tão antigo
E fecho os olhos, para todos os teus passos
Me enganando, só assim somos amigos

Por quantas vezes, me da raiva te querer
Em concordar com tudo que você me faz
Já fiz de tudo pra tentar te esquecer
Falta coragem pra dizer que nunca mais

Nos somos cumplices, nos dois somos culpados
No mesmo instante em que teu corpo toca o meu
Já não existe nem o certo nem o errado

E é assim o nosso jeito de viver

Em outras bocas não consigo te esquecer",Deslizes,2000

Que hoje vemos sobre ela
São feridas que os homens
Fizeram no corpo dela

Regue o chão, faça um pomar
Ouça a voz do passarinho

Quando os cedros vão tombando
Dão até a impressão
Que os estalos são gemidos
Implorando compaixão
As mãos do homem malvado
Desmatou sem precisão
Mas quando Deus sentir falta
Do pau que já foi cortado
O homem talvez procure
Por a culpa no machado
Ai Deus vai perguntar
""E por quem foi amolado?""
Fauna e flora valem mais
Do valor que o ouro tem
A natureza é selvagem
Mas não ofende ninguém
Ela é a mãe dos seres vivos
Precisa viver também

Hacía parte de una verdad

A nada digo que no

Eu só sabia que
O meu jantar ia ser a parte do animal
Que é mais dura que o meu pau
Com uma catinga assim
Só sendo rango de homem, não fode,
Meta o pau na aranha e coma a cabeça do bode
Vou comer a cabeça do bode
Comida boa é meu prato preferido
E eu não duvido duvido
Que não me faça suar
Me olhe nos olhos, tô sorrindo
Sinto os ouvido entupindo
E não dá pra disfarçar
Dá licença, olha pra lá
Primeiro naco, pela tua careta
Tu é fraco, é chapéu de couro de saco
Olhe o que tem lá no buraco
E não merece
Sem o poder do bicho tu não desce
É preciso relaxar
E como o olho do bode
Pode crê véi a idéia é essa eu digo, é isso aí mesmo
X chegando na área e falando na cara
Tomamos muita porrada no decorrer desses anos
Com o suor de nossos corpos chegamos onde estamos
Espalhando nossas idéias de norte a sul, leste oeste
Só moleque de presa somos do DF
Idéias das mais diversas vindo de nossas entranhas
Pra segurar a onda tem que ter as manha.

Tomei no see you, mas tomei no see you errado

Pois o povo aglomerado sempre tende a se esfregar

Carrão da porra tu pisava ele voava
Tu freiava ele ancorava

No bate-bate com a cabeça no volante
Voei pelos vidro da frente
E a raiva preta que eu não pude conter
Com o sangue quente cortei a testa
Quebrei os dente e toda aquela gente
Peste! Não vem ninguém me ajudar
Nem se mexiam pior que isso Ellis riam
Teto preto, o tempo fecha
Ozóvo inflama, hora do pau cantar
Eu quero é ver o oco
Só na mãozada eu deitei seis
Mas detestei mater
Eu quero é ver o oco
Sem controle tocando o fole
É hora de dançar
Meu ódio por automotores começou cedo
Depois que eu tranquei os dedo
Na porta do opalão
Meu pai de dentro se ria que se mijava
Achou que o filho festejava
Era dia de cosme e damião
Depois dos dedo foi o braço, a perna, as costas
Tu duvida? Bate uma aposta
Pois muitos vão lhe testemunhar
Tanta fratura que deixa a doutora louca
É pino até no céu da boca
Tu cansa só de tentar contar
Eu quero é ver o oco
É pedir muito uma enfermeira
Vir me ajudar
Eu quero é ver o oco
Uma enfermeira gente boa
Vem me medicar

Até hoje eu não esqueço o beijo que ela me deu
Era uma garota feia desdentada do cabelo ruim
Só que o que me importa é que ela faz tudo pra mim
E todo mundo falava: ""esse daí bebeu e se apaixonou
Pela mulher mais feia da região""
Só que o que você não entendeu é que quem
Pegou ela fui eu e ela me pegou pelo coração
Aquela mulher
Que tem a cintura fina
Quero me casar com ela
Pra que tudo na minha vida aconteça de verdade
Pra fazer com que eu me sinta com dez anos de idade
Pra parar de acompanhar e se importar com gente estúpida
E no outro dia quando amanheceu
Até hoje eu não consigo me esquecer do susto que ela me deu
Juro por deus era a mulher mais feia que eu já vi
E tenho que assumir que além de beijar eu dormi com

Vou contar uma história para o povo brasileiro
E também pros companheiros que vivem em auto mar
O marujo sai de casa e deixa a família chorando
Os filhos vão se criando sem pegar amor ao pai
Aprende a mexer no leme e as batatas descascar
Ele tem um headphone onde só toca ska
Maria não sai de casa pra não dar o que falar
É por isso que o marujo nunca deve se casar
Meu bem, meu bem
É por isso que o marujo nunca deve se casar
Vou contar uma estória para o povo sertanejo
É sobre um maconheiro que nasceu no Ceará
Ele veio pra Brasília e comeu uma mulher
Logo que teve uma filha chamou de Maria José
Mas o tempo foi passando e ele teve que se alistar
Escolheu logo a marinha pois nunca tinha visto o mar
Sua mulher desesperada não parava de rezar
É porque o Zé Pereira não sabia nem nadar
Meu bem, meu bem
E o resto da estória não precisa nem falar

Que aquilo fosse verdade foi por toda a cidade,

Raimundos,"Menininha da cidade foi pro mato e adorou
Tanta variedade de cobra, que apaixonou
Agora ela é viciada, sorriso de orelha a orelha
Atrás da bicharada, vive trepando nas telhas

Menininha da cidade foi pro mato e se soltou
Levou tanta picada, ficou cheia de calor
A noite ela abre a janela que é pra mosquitada entrar
A gente morde nela e ela coça devagar

Mais alto eu vou subir vamos lá!
Mais alto eu sou baixinho! Que é que há?
Mais alto Ela gritava mais alto e raca-raca
Ia relando no asfalto

Mais baixo ia gemendo mais baixo
Mais baixo o buraquinho é mais embaixo
Mais baixo ia botando para baixo
Eu digo, eita diacho! Ela é feia mas eu sou macho

Entra na veia. Ajoelhou, vai ter que rezar
Deita na teia, aranha malvada, que vai me devorar

Menininha da cidade foi pro mato e se mudou
Casou com um borrachudo que desde o nome ela gostou
Caiçara da mais doida, dos cabelo cheio de nó
Trocou a vida moderna e não larga mais do cipó

Se eu fosse um mosquitinho ia te chupar todo dia
Ia te morder com carinho e nadar na molhadinha
E na noite em que você, dormisse, só de calcinha
Ia pegar na dobrinha onde a carne é bem mais macia",Pompem,1999

Jogou minhas coisas fora
Disse que em sua cama eu não deito mais não

É campeã do mundo
A raiva era tanta que eu nem reparei que a lua diminuía

Põe fermento, põe as bomba
Qualquer coisa que aumente e a deixe bem maior que o sol
Pouca gente sabe que na noite

Até sem luz dá pra te enxergar no lençol
Fazendo congo-blue
É pena, eu sei, amanhã já vai miar, se aguente
Que lá vem chumbo quente!

Raimundos,"A vida me presenteou com dois primos já marmanjos
Um, muito justo, era o Augusto
O safado era o Berssange
Numa tarde ensolarada toda aquela cirançada tomando refrigerante...
Com a família embebedada foi mais fácil armar uma bimbada
Prum recém adolescente
Pois foi Berssange, primo velho e cancrado, que com muito do cuidado
Chegou pra Augustinho e disse:
""tu visse?
Dudu já tá alucinado, já é meio caminho andado
Pra rolinha comer alpiste
E pro rapaz não ficar triste vamo onde as nêga são ativa
Não há em toda João Pessoa lugar melhor que o rada viva""
E foi pra lá que nóis rumamos quase nos desenfreamos
Nóis num tinha nenhum plano e os cabra foram saindo
E eu atrás ia gritando:
""onde é que cês tão me levando
Voltar e buscar mainha ela ficou no bar sozinha""
""Ó menino abobado deixe mainha pra painho
Venha comigo e Augustinho
Tu vai ser inaugurado
Pois tu sabe, na família, nunca teve afrescalhado.
Quando cehgar no Roda Viva tu vai ser homenageado""
Quando eu cheguei no recinto o forró já tava bravo
Bando de nêgo suado dançando com as rapariga
E o forró comia solto e veio um véio com os óio torto
De tanto beber cachaça e disse:
""Essa menina é massa, vai te deixar arretado""
Meu primo me olhou de lado e disse; ""coitado""
Era uma quenga fedorenta, daquelas da mais nojenta
Mas se você não aguenta você a leva para o quarto
Ela pegou no meu pau pôs na boca e depois ficou de quatro...
Foi num puteiro em João Pessoa,
Eu descobri que a vida é boa
Foi a minha primeira vez...

And you'll learn, faking has no return

Will your feet get caught up in the crowd
And the song that you sing is too soft to be heard
But your speakers are way too loud
Like the pain, loving is no big game

Rainbow,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

In the mirror you can see her face
An angel dressed in the blackest lace
A sip of wine and the game can begin

Soft candle lights

The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

I've been thinking I've been having too much time to myself. 
I've been looking through the window, I kill myself. 
I've been holding onto nothing, overlooking the wall. 
Give me something that will leave me alone.",Dropping,1995
Rainbow Butt Monkeys,"Held it up,
You pushed it down.
Looked so wicked,
Wearing your crown,
Of cotton thorns.
I guess you fake the pain, the pain.
But since I can't really afford,
To give you what you want, what you want. 

Here I am,
Come and get me.
Bundled up,
Just like my grandma sent me.
Why'd you give it up,
It's like you never tried, you tried.
But if you try for something more,
You'll be giving up again, up again. 

Picked up a rock,
Wishing it was skin.
Never did know,
Where to begin.
To be more of me,
I need to see less of you, of you.
But since that same old feeling has gone, 
This won't be near as hard, near as hard. 

But since that same old feeling has gone,
This won't be near as hard.",St. Louis,1995
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, now, don't be sad 
I know we cannot stay 
But we've got a couple minutes 
And a little time to play 

I know you have important things 
So it's okay, just go 

But we can still pick one small, little thing 
To do with you, y'know! 

One small thing doesn't seem like a lot 
One small thing, work with the time you've got 
Soon, one small thing becomes two 
After two, perhaps another few 
Then one small thing is not so small 
One small thing can be the biggest thing of all 

All right now, since you're here 
Let's see what we can do 
Swim with the flow until you go 
Together, me and you 

I've got necklaces for every fish 
So what else do ya got? 

Well, we could play the bubblefish 
You'll like this one a lot! 

One small thing, it's a good place to start 

(Just one small thing) 

One small thing, and we don't seem so far apart 

(Don't seem apart) 

Soon, one small thing leads to more 
It's so much more than there was before 
Just one small thing, and you will see 
The start of something big for you and me 

One small thing 

Just one small thing 

Or a tall thing 

Just one tall thing 

Or a sing thing 

Just one sing-y thing 

Or a bling thing 

Just one bling-y thing 

A conga thing 

Yeah, a conga thing 

Or a longah thing 

Just one longah thing 

A blue thing, true thing, you thing (ooh-ooh) 

A whee thing, sea thing, me thing (ooh-ooh-ooh)

So many things and everything until our time is done 
There's one small thing for each and everyone! 

One small thing, so much we can create 
You and me, we started something great 
It's so amazing, look around 
At all the happy sights and sounds 
One small thing is big, it's true 
You did this all for us 
I just wish there was one small thing 
An extra special kind of thing 

That we could do for you
One small thing!",One Small Thing,2017
Rainbow Dash,"I know the world can get you down
Things don't work out quite the way that you thought
Feeling like all your best days are done
Your fears and doubts are all you've got

But there's a light, shining deep inside
Beneath those fears and doubts so just squash 'em
And let it shine for all the world to see
That it is time, yeah, time to be awesome

Ah, ah ah, ah, awesome
It's time to be so awesome
Ah, ah ah, ah, awesome
It's time to be so awesome

You've no idea how hard it's been (it's time to be so awesome)
This dull routine we've been forced to do

Don't let them rob you of who you are
Be awesome, it's all up to you (awesome)

I feel the light, stirring deep inside
It's like a tale still yet to be told (it's time to be so awesome)

And now it's time
To break the shackles free
And start living like
The brave and the bold

It's time to be awesome
Let loose, be true, so awesome
It's time to be awesome
Go big, be you, so awesome

We used to soar through the clouds in the skies

Elaborate schemes we would love to devise

We rescued our treasure and stored it away

Saving those gemstones for a rainy day

We see that light
Filling up our skies

So take the Storm King's orders and toss 'em

'Cause it's the time to let our colors fly

Hey Scallywags, it's time to be awesome

Hey
Hey
Hey

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

The young king sings a song for the lover, the leaver, the lonely alike
Young love waits, if I can't, then I'll meet you at 
The gate of Saint Peter when the fever takes my mind
My God she came singing my name, sounded like rain on the mountain where I burn alive
Young flame burn soft as a candle lit between 
Our two hearts just beats apart in the dark

Spent my summer riding high (high) on the whiplash
Head back
Blowing through the leaves

I'm at the Fever Pitch
Not quite but nearing it
Can't feed the fever yet I'm saving up my daily measurement

I'm at the grocery store
I'm buying eggs and toast
I'm looking at you and not where I walk, 'bout broke my nose facing doors
Don't let the fever get you
Got got already
Lost my soul in the seventh heaven making out on aisle eleven

All you ever needed were lines you could believe
Sing them to me sweetly
Only just a dream

With them heels in the dark
Kick 'em off
Let's talk
Let me get to know you
Well I don't know nothin'

I think I could get you in a minute or two
Yeah if I could get a minute
Four, five at the limit
I think I might make you

Kick me under the table

And I think I came for that
What comes with it?

Rainbow Kitten Surprise,"I got some radio wires soldered to my heart
You're the only thing that's coming in
I'm getting static from my better sense
Nothing on the fm
See, I've been praying for a signal
A sign that you haven't sent
You might be an angel falling from the heavens
Or a stranger from a garden party drunk and roaming ever since

I've got a radio heart and you're the only thing that's coming in
Static from my better sense
Stagnant on my betterment
I'm praying for signal or a sign that you haven't sent

I keep my bags packed
I don't wanna leave, just don't wanna leave last
I've been praying for your touch, your glance, your hand

And he's a better kisser than you'd think, mom
He's a better listener than most
We took pretty pictures by the sea, mom
Fell in love and sailed off
And when the son of man had me in his clutches
The son of man had me in his clutches
The son of man had me in his clutches
The sons of men pulled me to the touch and I loved it

I hate you more than I miss you
That's not true, I'd hate to miss you

I said to the devil, ""devil do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?""
He said only ""sundown, Sundays, Christmas""

Some day's end when I need a few friends
Now and again I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been

Don't get me venting on friends who resent you 
'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless they fell into hell 
Where you both hang with nothing to do but

You could let it all go, you could let it all go

Can't be bothered better handle your shit
Keep about your wits man, keep about your wits
Know yourself and who you came in with
Can I sit down I've been hustling all day
I can't even count how many souls I've made

And you don't want no help, oh well
