Gemeliers,"No he perdido la esperanza durante todo ese tiempo
Tú me das la fuerza para seguir 
Prisas, noches sin descanso 
De un hotel a otro aeropuerto 
México, Milán, Sevilla o Madrid 

Y he surcado siete mares
Amarrado en tantos puertos 
Con la tinta de mis versos dibujé dos hemisferios 
De equipaje llevo tu aliento 
Bajo llave dentro del corazón 

Gracias por ser el aire que me ha dado la vida
Por cada lágrima viva que has derramado por mí
Gracias por cada beso incendias la luna 
Por la bendita locura de soñar junto a mí 

Ai ai ai ai ai ai 

Yo no me doy por vencido 
Ya lo ves amiga mía 
Siempre lo mejor está por venir 
Encender mil y una noches en un carrusel de sueños 
Yo prefiero decírtelo así 

Y he surcado siete mares
Amarrado en tantos puertos
Con la tinta de mis versos dibujé dos hemisferios 
De equipaje llevo tu aliento
Bajo llave dentro del corazón 

Gracias por ser el aire que me ha dado la vida
Por cada lágrima viva que has derramado por mí
Gracias por cada beso incendias la luna
Por la bendita locura de soñar junto a mí 

Gracias por ser el aire que me ha dado la vida
Por cada lágrima viva que has derramado por mí 
Gracias por cada beso incendias la luna
Por la bendita locura de soñar junto a mí 

Gracias por ser el aire que me ha dado la vida 
Por cada lágrima viva que has derramado por mí 
Gracias por cada beso incendias la luna
Por la bendita locura de soñar junto a mí

Gracias por ser el aire que me ha dado la vida 
Por cada lágrima viva que has derramado por mí 
Gracias por cada beso incendias la luna 
Por la bendita locura de soñar junto a mi 

No he perdido la esperanza durante todo este tiempo
Tú me das la fuerza para seguir",Gracias,2017
Gemeliers,"No me ignores
No pierdas tiempo en otras canciones
Tú sabes bien que estoy aquí como un idiota
Pudiendo estar con otra, ay

Suena el teléfono y me late el corazón
Puede que seas un aumento a la tensión
Y no me importa que me llames
Si tú no eres, no me vales
Solo tú les das sentido a mi canción

Llega un mensaje y no lo puedo resistir
Qué no daría yo porque fuera de ti
Y así acabar con ese impulso 
De estar cada dos segundos
Revisando a ver si te acuerdas de mí

Y ya no puedo más, no más, no más
Con este sufrimiento de esperanza y tú apareces
No logro respirar, te vas, te vas
No hay nada en este mundo que compense que no quieras hablar
Por eso digo

No me ignores
No pierdas tiempo en otras canciones
Tú sabes bien que estoy aquí como un idiota
Pudiendo estar con otra
Pero tú te me apareces y no pienso en otra cosa y digo

No me ignores
Descubrirás que existen mil razones
Y cuando me dejes ser parte de tu vida
Yo te entregaré la mía si tan solo me dejaras de ignorar

Pasan los meses y no das una señal
Con cada luna yo te pienso más y más
Es que la gente no comprende
Siempre el ego se suspende
Ven amor, hoy me equivoco de verdad

Si es que al final vas a volverte a aparecer
Sigues jugando porque no vas a perder
Le das lo justo y suficiente, 
Para estar siempre en mi mente
Porque sabes que así yo voy a volver

Y ya no puedo más, no más, no más
Con este sufrimiento de esperanza y tú apareces
No logro respirar, te vas, te vas
No hay nada en este mundo que compense que no quieras hablar
Por eso digo

No me ignores

Tú sabes bien que estoy aquí como un idiota
Pudiendo estar con otra
Pero tú te me apareces y no pienso en otra cosa y digo

No me ignores
Descubrirás que existen mil razones
Y cuando me dejes ser parte de tu vida
Yo te entregaré la mía si tan solo me dejaras de ignorar

Solo te pido una vez
Baja la guardia por un día
Solo te pido una vez
Para mostrarte lo que haría
La luna y el cielo, yo te las daría
Solo con tal de lograr

Tú ya no me ignores
No pierdas tiempo oyendo otras canciones
Tú sabes bien que estoy aquí como un idiota
Pudiendo estar con otra
Pero tú te me apareces y no pienso en otra cosa y digo

Gemeliers,"¿Y ahora que vas a hacer? 
Si tienes al mal y al bien 
Y quieres probar algo nuevo 
Y siempre se puede aprender 
No te sientas mal por querer conmigo y con él
Imagínate
Un ángel y un demonio 
Y yo metiéndote 
Ideas que te asustan pero quieres ver 
Y caer en el juego 
De un infierno en las nubes 
Y un paraíso en el fuego

Revelando misterios

Vamo' alzando el vuelo 
Recomiendo cerrar los ojos 
Pa' que no te atrape el miedo 
Vuela, vuela, más alto 
Agárrate, de mi espalda 
Agárrate, un malo desvistiéndote 
Y el bueno complaciendote 
Ya lo sabes 
Y ahora como si números impares 
Soñaba con 1 
Y te llevaste a 2 
La culpa solo vive en la razón 
Y perdemos la razón

Gemelli DiVersi,"Mary...è andata via
l'hanno vista piangere
correva nel buio di una ferrovia
notti di sirene in quella periferia
si dice che di tutti noi ha un po' nostalgia
ma lei se ne è andata Mary....

Si sente sola Mary
ora ha paura Mary
l'ho vista piangere poi chiedere una risposta al cielo Mary
e ora il suo sguardo non mente
ha gli occhi di chi nasconde alla gente
gli abusi osceni del padre ma non vuol parlarne Mary
e cela i suoi dolori in ogni foglio del diario che ora ha tra le mani
e guardando vecchie foto chiede aiuto ad una preghiera
sui polsi i segni di quegli anni chiusi in una galera
la madre che sa tutto e resta zitta
ora il suo volto porta i segni di una nuova sconfitta e
l'ho vista girar per la città senza una meta
dentro lo zaino i ricordi che le han sporcato la vita
tradita da chi l'ha messa al Mondo
e in secondo sul suo corpo
i segni di un padre che per Mary adesso è morto è
stanca Mary non ha più lacrime ed ora chiede al destino un sorriso
chiuso in un sogno la sera ma....

dicono che Mary se n'è andata via
l'hanno vista piangere correva nel buio di una ferrovia
sanno che scappava notti di sirene in quella periferia
non bastava correre si dice che di noi tutti abbia un po' nostalgia
ma lei se n'è andata
Mary che cammina su sentieri più scuri
stai cercando sorrisi sinceri oltre i muri di questa città
oh Mary camminando su sentieri più scuri sul diario segreto scrivevi
""quella bestia non è mio papà""

ora ripenso a quando mi parlavi in lacrime
dicevi questa vita non la cambio ma ci sto provando sto pregando ma
sembra inutile e abbracciandomi dicesti tornerò....

hey guarda c'è Mary
è tornata in stazione
sai stringe la mano a due persone
il suo bel viso ha cambiato espressione
senza più gocce di dolore
ora la bacia il sole bacia il suo uomo e la bimba nata dal suo vero amore
con quel suo sorriso che da senso a tutto il resto protetto
da un mondo sposrco che ha scoperto troppo presto
ha un'anima ferita un'innocenza rubata
sa che è la vita non una fiaba ma ora
Mary è tornata una fata

cammina lenta ma sembra che sia contenta, attenta
una sfida eterna aspetta ma non la spaventa
era altrove e suo padre ora ha smesso di vivere Mary
fissa la sua lapide versare lacrime è impossibile 

Si chiedono ma è Mery quella in fondo alla via??è riuscita a crescere
tornata con il giorno in quella ferrovia fresca di rugiada parla di sè
Mary senza nostalgia stanca ormai di piangere
lei sa quanto dura questa vita sia
ma lei l'ha cambiata
Mary camminando su sentieri più scuri
hai trovato sorrisi sinceri oltre i muri di questa città
oh Mary camminavi su sentieri più scuri
sul diario segreto scrivevi ""quella besta non è mio papà...""",Mary,2002
Gemelli DiVersi,"E allora eccomi qui adesso resto per un po' da solo meglio così io per il mondo oggi non ci sono e voglio restare con me stesso a pensare se solo adesso mi fermo ancora mi sembra di sognare una foto coi miei attrae il mio sguardo in quello scatolone ricordo sai era la mia prima comunione un caldo infernale un pranzo con poche persone quel vestito nuovo rotto poi giocando a pallone e ancora eccole qui tra mille foto impolverate vedo così le mie emozioni immortalate troppi ricordi momenti incancellabili mentre una lacrima disegna un solco tra I miei brividi guarda mio padre coi baffi siamo nei settanta quel pancione mia madre lo porta assai contenta le foto alle elementari in bianco e nero e a colori guarda questa non ci credo a me lo sai sembra ieri... 
Cerco su ogni volto un ricordo e sembra che il tempo non sia mai trascorso e un brivido chiude lo stomaco rimango incredulo e so che le emozioni non muoiono mai...
Vedo gente con noi persa lungo questo mio cammino giuro che mai avrei riconosciuto quel bambino e che cambiamenti tra gli amici e parenti con le mie pettinature quando stavo sui venti mi fermo un attimo qui o meglio mi si ferma il cuore quando a un tratto così ritrovo il primo grande amore resto senza parole sai che eri bellissima guardando dietro c'è un cuore due frecce ed una dedica \""Staremo insieme per sempre tu sei la mia vita\"" e un sorriso innocente per poi com'è andata troppo distanti ma troppo simili sono I tuoi occhi a suggerirmelo qui non hai alibi ritrovo serenità quando rivivo quei momenti in tutta sincerità anni rivisti in pochi istanti guarda questa è l'arena ero a vedere Vasco la metto sul comodino accompagnerà questo mio testo
Cerco su ogni volto un ricordo e sembra che il tempo non sia mai trascorso e un brivido chiude lo stomaco rimango incredulo e so che le emozioni non muoiono mai
E non so se sorridere io non so cosa può succedere so che voglio vivere fermando il tempo e guardarlo in un fotoricordo
E in sottofondo mettere buona musica questa la voglio me la stacco dalla pagina è la più vecchia c'è tutta la comitiva sembra persino che anche il sole sorrida quanto sembriamo diversi sempre gli stessi alcuni si sono persi ma noi ci siamo ancora e allora scatta subito così per sempre avremo accanto il nostro pubblico

Gemelli DiVersi,"Hey
Come ti chiami te?
Nicole Merli
Quanti anni hai?
Due e mezzo
Nicole chi c’è?
Zio Spazio, Zio Grido, Zio Strano, Zio Thema
Poi?
JAx
E il beat chi lo fa?
Papà Ale su le mani
Ogni singola frase si infiamma
Quando lo snare frusta il pentagramma
La fotta è sempre tanta
Solo falle nel terreno a ostacolare ogni mio passo
Sempre forte nel mio campo e duro fino all’osso
Duro dagli anni delle adidas senza i lacci
Io duro negli anni come scioltomi dai ghiacci
Io duro da sempre come il sole dall’origine
Il timbro è scuro nero come la fuliggine
Il foglio bianco io lo sporco con spremute di cervello
E le minchiate io le sparo con l’uccello bello
SF senza false modestie
Zio siamo fuori nella notte come bestie
Io giro col meglio gli altri stiano al loro posto
Hannibal Lecter oggi è pronto per il pasto
Dolce di gusto butto sempre sangue amaro
E ogni affronto a sta faccenda va pagato caro

Niente giri di parole vado nudo e crudo
Da troppo tempo ingoio merda adesso sono stufo
SF è il codice se vuoi te lo traduco
Io sono super fresh tu sei fottuto
Con il suono del futuro sfondiamo le casse
Sempre forti sempre fatti sempre fuoriclasse
Sempre veri sempre fieri oggi più di ieri
Con i miei scleri i miei problemi i miei polmoni neri
Con la mia compagnia della periferia
Che mi ricorda che la strada è ancora casa mia
Ma non ci trovi coi cannoni a far gli imitatori
Noi siamo quelli che hanno il logo coi tre pomodori
Tu non c’avresti scommesso nemmeno mille lire
Per te saremo spariti come le letterine
Diec’anni dopo ancora in gioco adesso chi è che ride?
SF: vuole dire senza fine

Sono partito da zero
Scrivo il mio nome nel cielo
Ma sono ancora dov’ero
Io non lo sento più
Quello che dici tu
Chi mi conosce se ne fotte di te
SF vuole dire senza fine
SF vuole dire senza fine
SF vuole dire senza fine

Sempre fatti per natura infatti siamo fuori
Dal tuo giro ma ci trovi sotto i riflettori
Sei finito non molliamo siamo gladiatori
Solo fighe nel backstage dillo ai calciatori
Sono figlio di operai cresciuto a calci in culo
Sono frutto di un’Italia andata ormai a fanculo
Sono finto sono figo come dite vuoi
Come scrivo come vivo sono fatti miei
Capolavoro al pomodoro per la music hall
Suona spesso ancora adesso nell’i pod
97-09 crepe sulla nazione
Big dogs di regione in regione dove
Senza filtro su disco come su palco
Io solo fatti capisci? Questo è quanto
Senza freni sempre in piedi ora e più che mai
SF senza fine siamo solo noi

SF sono fiero squadra favorita
SF cambia senso dalla prospettiva
A te sembra facile senza fatica
E che saremmo falliti senza fresca e senza figa
Invece siamo SF e dominiamo sta seconda fase
Anche se un po’ siamo fottuti dalle nostre pare
Io sono folle sempre fumo super fruitore
Spendo fogli sulle foglie sono il fondatore
SF la mia luce splende forte in questo sonno farmaceutico
Scrivo fogli sfonda porte sono famoso per essere sempre in forse
Col suono favoloso so fare saltare folle
Sono felice di rappresentare chi se ne fotte
So fare senza futuro come diceva Rotten
Senza fine alla faccia dei detrattori
Anzi sulla faccia come porno attori

Facciam saltare teste senza fucile
Passiamo troppe notti senza dormire
Con noi rimani sempre senza cartine
Ma SF vuole dire senza fine

Gemelli DiVersi,"Chissà se esiste un posto al di là delle stelle
Dove non conta di che colore sia la tua pelle
E la gente dice liberamente quello che pensa
No sopravvive ma vive la sua esistenza
Perché a vent'anni ogni giorno è un giorno di festa
Poi il tempo passa e ruba la spensieratezza
Restano solo i ricordi di gioventù bruciate
Le calde notti d'estate e l'eco delle risate
Ma poi arriva l'autunno e si ritorna in città
E con l'età aumentano le responsabilità
Rubano il posto alla ribellione adolescenziale
La vita cambia anche la gente che non vuol cambiare
Ma io non lo so fare e lascio bruciare la fiamma
Chiedo alla musica liberami da questa gabbia
Tienimi sveglio quando la città si ferma
E volo anche coi piedi per terra

Quando si accendono le luci dei lampioni
Guardo fuori e viaggio con la fantasia
Costruisco un'astronave di cartoni
Come da bambino e sogno di volare via
Allora vieni con me
Vieni via con me
Voliamo al di là delle stelle
Chiudi gli occhi e vieni via con me

Ci immaginiamo mondi nuovi aldilà delle stelle
Per sentirci meno soli in queste notti fredde
Mentre basterebbe
Rispettarci un po' di più gli uni con gli altri invece di farci la pelle
La razza umana non impara dagli errori
Inverte la scala valori
Qua mica vincono i buoni
Spettatori di orrori
Ogni giorno sempre peggiori
Non trovi come starne fuori
E se provi fondi i neuroni
Anche se sbotti
Sembra che nessuno ascolti
Gli sbatti dritta in faccia la realtà chiudono gli occhi
Paura e tenebre fiducia in cenere 
Chi dà valore ad un sorriso viene preso per un debole
Ognuno sta al suo posto ingoiando il rospo
E vale tutto perché tutto ha un costo
Abbiamo una finestra sempre aperta sul mondo
Ma ci stiamo allontanando un po' ogni giorno
Come stelle nel cosmo 
Quando si accendono le luci dei lampioni
Guardo fuori e viaggio con la fantasia
Costruisco un'astronave di cartoni
Come da bambino e sogno di volare via
Allora vieni con me
Vieni via con me
Voliamo al di là delle stelle
Chiudi gli occhi e vieni via con me",Al di Là Delle Stelle,2012
Gemelli DiVersi,"Quando ti guardo vedo un anima che brilla
Perché tu ogni volta tu riaccendi la scintilla
E a giudicare dalle foto di famiglia 
È la stessa luce nello sguardo di quando eri bimba
Se fossi nata sottoforma di una stella
Saresti quella che mi indica la rotta
E se fossi nata anche solo una caramella 
Saresti una di quelle che mi frizzano in bocca
Se fossi un colore non saresti il nero
Ma saresti l'arcobaleno
Con un tocco magico il cielo resterebbe sempre sereno
E se tu fossi solamente una canzone
Saresti l'inno di una rivoluzione
Doneresti buon umore alle persone
Il resto della musica sarebbe una cover

Questo universo si muove intorno a te
Qualsiasi cosa
Tu che nemmeno ti accorgi di come sei meravigliosa
Perché sei come sei
Tu sei come sei
Tu sei come sei
Lo sai meravigliosa
Lo sai meravigliosa

Invece io ho qualche rotella fuori posto
E sopportarmi è dura
Me ne rendo conto
Perfino quando mi ritrovo tutti contro
Testardo fino in fondo
Non te lo nascondo
Io che ogni giorno corro in una strada nuova
Mi sono accorto che tu sei la mia fortuna
E se tu fossi solo un abito alla moda
So che per me saresti stara fatta su misura
E se non fossi mai venuta qui
Sarebbe stato tutto inutile
Io che ero nelle sabbie mobili
Ora passeggio tra le nuvole
Tu non ci credi se ti dico sei perfetta
Ascolta con il cuore non più con la testa
Tu vuoi la verità
La verità è questa
Mi piaci perché sei semplicemente te stessa

Questo universo si muove intorno a te
Qualsiasi cosa
Tu che nemmeno ti accorgi di come sei meravigliosa
Perché sei come sei

Gemelli DiVersi,"Che cosa sono 'ste facce da funerale?
""Spaghetti Funk is dead"" mi ha detto un infame
Ma per la strada c'è chi grida: ""Stai male""
Spaghetti Funk is back, che lecca totale
Qui non ci sono falsi e non ci sono scarsi
Se muore un suono si fa il nuovo e non ci sono cazzi
La tua roba fa cagare, per me è lassativa
Questa roba manda a male come la sativa
E quindi sta sicuro che non c'è nessuno che lo fa così
Ditemi di: ""No"" e andate a fare in culo, tutti contro il muro come la police
Io vi schiverò mentre vivo sfrecciando a duecento all'ora
Generazione nuova ma ne vuole ancora
Da questi zombie che sfondano le tue casse
Ed è sicuro come morte e tasse

Io preferisco i truzzi ai primi della classe
Il rispetto dei palazzi alle recensioni a 5 stelle
Preferisco chi lo sente a pelle piacere alle pischelle piuttosto che a XL
Cambia la moda e io ne esco indenne sarò il primo sessantenne primo a TRL
Ero un bimbominchia, carne da mattatoio
Per questo io dirò: ""Bella zio"" finché muoio
Con questo vizio di farci e di autoglorificarci
È così facile odiarci, e mo potete sfogarvi
Ho la major, i media, l'invidia
Posso non cagarvi come la Marcuzzi senza Activia
10 dischi tutti in culo alla critica la figa di classe e pure la classifica
Nel paese che limita chi non milita, Spaghetti Funk dalla culla alla clinica

Metto la voce dove non c'è luce per riconoscere bugie nelle tenebre
Sono il contrario di quello che si dice come la fenice risorgo dalla cenere

Il nuovo rat pack, life after death and Spaghetti Funk
Yes-man! We are back in black
Ottava meraviglia, mi faccio mamma e figlia
Sono hot, hot, hot, o Ice come Vanilla
Sono amato worldwide più della pasta di Antonio
Un giorno nel mio lifestyle, ti manda al manicomio
Ho fatto più sex scandal di John Terry
Ma su 'sto palco ribalto come Joe Perry
Tu che mi davi per spacciato come in plaza la ganja
Ora manda 'sta boccia, ho una gamba di mancia
Teen idol, io, poco credibile
Fossi un cesso sarei un idol per le critiche
Ma sono il diamante più grezzo in terra di Mandela
Se non ti piace 'sto pezzo, suona 'sta vuvuzela
Mi faccio un Montenegro dopo una coca con Jack
Adesso puoi crocefiggermi come lui: I'll be back

C'è chi ha ucciso i Kennedy, chi invece ammazza il beat
Chi ha impasticcato Marylin e fa ipotesi su un true MC
Spaghetti Funk è ""D"" con ""E"" con ""A"" e ""D"", è l'ABC dell' R-A-P
La storia in Italy, come in ""Asganaway"", top di gamma, dope rhyme
Top ganja, Space Uanna top swagga, ""No limit"" si legge: ""No danger""
Spaghetti Funk è oltraggio alla legge e non ci sono cazzi contro un leader
Faccio sogni dove sono tutti i giorni Martin Luther, brotha, volevi l'SF morta e sepolta
Ora ci sarebbe molta meno gente che ti ascolta
Auguri, soffia il candelotto su 'sta torta
Anzi ascolta: risparmia il fiato parli e basta
L'invidia è la tua para, cambia il pusha

Come manichini in un crash test
A novanta contro il muro in una gara di burlesque
C'è paranoia dove vivo
Monti ci rende zombie president evil
Qui se la danno a gambe come Schettino
Con il bottino come Bettino

Generazione della disperazione

Se per un concerto mi sposto su ruota
Do i soldi all'autista l'opposto del Trota
Siamo un popolo che non si informa
Che si accontenta della pappa pronta
Che si lamenta ma che non fa una rivolta
E pensa non ci sarà più il futuro di una volta
Alle persone manca l'aria
E diventano pazze come le cartelle di Equitalia
Io vorrei i padroni della lobby bancaria
Tutti puniti come a Naia

Perché la vita è una, non avrò paura 
Di una fregatura in più, anche se a volte è dura
Non avrò paura come mi hai insegnato tu

Di una fregatura in più, anche se a volte è dura
Non avrò paura come mi hai insegnato tu

Before the summer’s gone
Winter's here

Stavo sparando contro le lattine
Vuote come me, come le mattine
In cui ti svegli e non sai dove sei
Mi ritrovo solo, stanza 106
Sto spappolato dentro un ascensore
Che va al decimo piano
Vorrei il tuo cuore in mano
Stringerlo piano
Avere un pezzo di te che sia mio per sempre
Invece ti guardo ma da una lente
Farti sparire sotto le coperte
Ti canto nelle orecchie una mia strofa e ti diverto
Ti chiamo sotto effetto di qualche stupefacente
Ascolto la tua voce, stupefacente
E il cielo si apre in due con un lampo
È come se mi abbassi la lampo
È come quando il peso è tanto
Tutti gli altri vanno ma tu resti con me

Se questo cielo si fa Baghdad
Ti svegli con le bombe all'alba
E in mezzo a questo fumo tu mi cercavi
Ciò che cercavi non c'è
E ora che il cielo si fa Baghdad
Vorresti solo farne un'altra
E in mezzo al fumo dove io ti cercavo
Ciò che cercavo non c'è

A me e te ci dovrebbero ibernare qui
Seduti così, non spiccicando una parola
Con le gambe a penzoloni al mondo
Nel fiume scorrono i pensieri
Non li fermi, se ne vanno via
E qualcuno li dimentica
Io ti sollevo tipo bimbo, tipo Lion King
Se siamo liberi allora nel dubbio avvinghiati
Stringimi finché fa male (ehi)
Fammi vedere fino a che punto vuoi vedermi affogare (giù)
C'è il mare grosso dietro le cabine
Gente come me sempre col cappuccio in the panchine
Sì che faranno tutto questo e anche il resto
Mille volte ancora
Solo per il gusto di volare ancora
In alto, in prima fila con due stracci addosso
Becco scalfito delle aquile, la parte fragile
Momento esatto in cui saltiamo insieme con le braccia in aria
E non riatterriamo più

Am I going down

Am I having doubts
Life is not always showing
Am I safe and sound

See I'm living all alone

When all the cards ain't there
And I'm starting to dig
All the voices inside my head

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time

I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign

Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Of many things
Of how my life used to be
I'm doubting me
Before my world started sinking
I don't wanna drown
I used to feel so free
But now my back's against the wall
Can't see light at all
Every time I try and play pool
It takes my ball
And I don't care about nothing at all

Bang his hat, learn his shakes
Master his swagger in the bathroom mirror

Look his moms in her face and promise he's straight

Then he leaves the house that love built that
HUD renovated that section 8 pays for
Well let's pray for em, let the beat play for em
Put his struggles on display for 'em
Cause he gotta go and face the drama
With a different face from the one that he use
To face his momma, if you look close you'll see
It consist of a smile that hurts, an ice grill, and a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father, another criterion
That's no different from a young Liberian
Who let the delirium weary him, living in the inner city
Out of his mind, liria reconcilia
I'm cool, I don't foretell best
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't Cornel West
I am Cornel Westside, Chi-town Guevara

I go crazy and I lose my mind
Trade my world and I'd give my life

'cause it feels so right

And every day you make it clear that you don't want to be replaced
Just by them little things you do, just by them little things you say
Five years done past and we done went through some drama
From court dates to miscarriages to you losing your mama

That you're my one and only
Baby oh I'm going crazy
I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more

Memories ease my pain
I keep hearing you laughin, screamin, callin my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

My only sanity in these walls
Is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind

We share a life in one dimension
Our problems always seem to cloud the sky
But we don't pay them much attention

And with every day
We drift apart
I can feel it in my heart
That man is not the man I used to know

And though a part of me still needs him so
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly

No angry words and no heart-rending scenes
And we should take it as a warning
We keep on going through the old routines
Exchanging kisses in the morning

And with every day we drift apart
And the fear is in my heart
I read the signs and I should be mature
And yet a child could not be more unsure

There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly
Our passion's just a distant memory

And in its place a dull frustration
A cold indifference where there used to be
At least a frequent irritation
But a feeling still

Of tenderness
And of pity, so I guess
I'll be the woman in his arms tonight
If he should need someone to hold him tight

He's like a child
But I feel my love die
Slowly
That man is not the man I used to know

The ultimate expression of who I am
Incredulous
The barren definition of a dying man
Presumptuous
To assume that a tomb is not the body you’re walking in
In all of us
Is a sin that begins and doesn’t end until we siphon the last breath.

I am alive inside of your truth
I am your proof

We are all the light of the sun and the moon
And we will be the same as one
You are just a reflection of all that you see
And you are always alive in me

The fatal flaw of a forgiving God
Dismissive
Reactionary to all the laws above

Into the wake of mistakes and see the cosmos exploding

Deranged
And a sense of abandon

Quel locale pettinato ci sembrava un puttantour
Immaginiamoci Corfù, poi after al Cocoon, yeh
A Pamplona non ce regge la corsa coi tori, eh
Questa curva, troppa gente, ormai un mazzo di fiori

Un cane chiuso in auto d'estate
Un'onda in mare che non sa nuotare
Un vino rosso che non si può bere
Ma nient'altro da stappare
E tu sei ghiaccio dentro a un bicchiere
Ci siamo senza rimanere
Chiedo il conto al cameriere
Ma tu sei già andata via
Ma tu sei già andata via
Ma tu sei già andata via
Via
Ma tu sei già andata via

(Baby)
Sono le sei, fuori sta diluviando, te dove sei?
Sto aspettando il sole sembra il '96
No davvero, non è tutto ok
Tu non ti preoccupare, fai come ieri
Asciuga il mare dei tuoi pensieri (wow)
Altro che Malibu
Vinco io se facciamo gara a chi ce ne ha di più
Bevo questo, bevo quello e poi
Mi giro e ti mando un bacio pure se non vuoi
Che non credo alle favole
Mi dici ""Sì"" ma mi sa è lo Chardonnay
Fumiamo questa e restiamo abbracciati un po'
Tra un orgasmo e un attacco di panico
Sono apatico, sì, sono empatico
Come la notte d'estate no?
Forse il prossimo anno imparerò, imparerò

E mangiamo le pasticche dentro allo stadio
Una sciarpa che ci abbraccia ripescata dall'armadio

Un cane chiuso in auto d'estate
Un'onda in mare che non sa nuotare
Un vino rosso che non si può bere

Ma io non cambio mai
E pure se dici che sbaglio
Non cambio mai, no, non cambio mai

A sedici anni mollavo la scuola
In bocca una canna, bocciato di nuovo
Ho detto a mamma ""là non ci torno, è la mia parola""
Poi lei in ventiquattr'ore mi ha detto cos'è l'amore
Prendere il cuore e trasformarlo in un oggetto senza valore
Dalle scritte sui diari, a quelle sui binari
Imprinting musicali, gli istinti suicidari
Le droghe, l'alcool, l'erba, l'apatia e i medicinali
L'amore per questa merda e i vostri dischi tutti uguali
L'avevo promesso
Fin dal primo giorno che sognavo che sarei stato lo stesso
Anche se fossi caduto dal sesto piano
Non mi chiamare più a quest'orario
Non so rispondere al questionario
Quello che so è che ho perso svario
Non puoi convincermi del contrario (del contrario, mai)
Forse ho perduto troppo spesso
Mai stato un venduto sottomesso (no)
È stata la prima cosa che ho promesso (cosa?)
Essere vero è l'unico compromesso (ciao, ciao)

A sedici anni la fica e le droghe
Poi noto l'invidia che rode
Che tutta la vita è una frode
Chiunque fatica non gode
Ed io non ho imparato preghiere
Ho scritto intere pagine vuote
Senza mai farmi vedere
Coi drammi grammi e il bicchiere
Antisociale, eremita
Da dove vengo non c'è scelta
Avere talento è croce certa
Devi incrociare le dita
Io tossico terrone
Il prossimo che muore
Fallito con un litro di monossido nel cuore
Anni di buio, fatti di brutto
Attacchi di panico, pacchi di fumo
Carichi in studio per chiudere i brani
Eludere i piani di studio
Poi tendere all'eccesso
Spesso perso nell'alcool
Per essere me stesso
Non ho chiesto nient'altro
Le notti senza lei
Il beat in repeat
Fino alle tre e mezza in play
Pensa senza che sarei
Vendo sogni al dettaglio
Sogno soldi a ventaglio
Sbaglio, sto a repentaglio
Come chi vende a dettaglio

Ho messo tutto a repentaglio

You'll hold me down

Out of luck 
Have trouble trying to wake myself

Dragged me up to better health

I'm not afraid to lose

I could look at you for years

You're so easy on the eye
And you ease my troubled mind
You're so easy on the eye

I watch you from the road
Restless under a suburban sky
You have no idea what you do to me
You make me wanna stay

You're so easy on the eye
And you ease my troubled mind
You're so easy on the eye",Easy on the Eye,2005
Gemma Hayes,"My dirty joy, my laden back
My will to live is under attack
I have the days when it comes easy
My blue eyed boy got show and tell
I need your laugh to make me well
No light is coming through my window

Gotta meet you face to face
Convince you that I'm not so strange
Just happy sad
I'm broken down
But I'm okay, upbeat when you come around
I'm happy sad and it comes easy to me
I'm never one or the other

You have knocked me off my track
One lap to go and now I'm last
You know I used to be so eager
Get up, get up, get out of bed
The brightest day that ever led
You know you make me want to try harder

[Chorus]

My friends are few, but that's okay
'cause when you're around it all just fades away
My sadder boy

I'm happy sad
I'm broken down
But I'm upbeat when you come around
I'm happy sad
And it comes easy to me
I'm never one or the other

Gemma Hayes,"I will welcome any stranger
For strangeness is a welcome guest
And I will make a bed for him to rest

We will arise there after
Fall around the place in drunken laughter
And never look back again

Weighed heavy on our chest

Gen,"Dance in Sand and Sea
So here we are, or rather, here I am, quite alone,
I'm seeing things that were shared before, long ago 
My memory stretches and I am dazed: you know I know
How good the time was and how I laughed 
Times have changed, now you're far away, I can't complain:
I had all my chances but they slipped right through my hands - like so much sand;
I know I'll never dance like I used to

I'll just wait till day breaks upon the land and the sea.
Hoping that I can catch all of the memories,
Then I must crawl off upon my way, all of me
Listening hard for the final words.
But there are none; the sunrise calls, I've lingered on
Too close for comfort and I don't know quite why
I feel like crying 
I know we'll never dance like we used to.

I look up, I'm almost blinded by the warmth of what's inside me
And the taste that's in my soul,
But I'm dead inside as I stand alone 

Dance in Frost
I wore my moods like so many different sets of clothes
But the right one was never around;
And as you left I heard my body ring
And my mind began to howl
It was far to late to contemplate the meaning of it all:
You know that I need you, but somehow I don't think
You see my love at all

At some point I lost you, I don't know quite how it was;
The wonderland lay in a coat of white, chilling frost
I looked around and I found I was truly lost:
Without your hand in mine I am dead 
Reality is unreal and games I've tried just aren't the same:
Without your smile there's nowhere to hide
And deep inside
I know I've never cried as I'm about to 

If I could just frame the words that would make your fire burn
All this water now around me could be the love that
Should surround me.

Looking out through the tears that bind me
My heart bleeds that you may find me .. or at least that I can
Forget and be numb, but I can't stop, the words still come:
I love you",Lost,
Gen Horiuchi,"I have never felt like this

That only we are hearing

I don't know what's going on

Gene Ammons,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By Thy return sweet hour of prayer

Thy wings shall my petition bear

And since he bids me seek his face
Believe his word and trust his grace

And wait for Thee sweet hour of prayer",Sweet Hour,1962

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

In love with lovely you,
And pray my dream comes true.

I long to kiss you

It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moon Beams,1963

You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Back Yard,2006

Then let the fire start

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

When you and I had strolled away
And suddenly a storm grew nigh
Seeking shelter from the rain
We hurried down a little lane
Found a lovely spot nearby

T'was just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray

The raindrops kissed the flowerbeds
The blossoms raise their pretty heads
A purfumed ""thank you"" they seemed to say

Surely here was charm beyond compare to view
Maybe it was just that I was there with you?

Gene Autry,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

And I lied as I whispered, ""mañana""

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted “On Dasher” and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!”

Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross,2003
Gene Autry,"Santa works all day in his workshop
Making lots of games and toys
Then one day, he hops in his sleigh
To bring them to the girls and boys
Santa's just as nice as he can be
There's just one little thing that worries me.

If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh
In case of rain, will there be a train
That'll speed him on his way
If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How will Santa get around to us
If he breaks down on his way to town
Will they let him use a bus?
I sent him a nice long letter
And I hope it's not in vain
I'd really feel much better
If I knew he could fly a plane.

People say he has eight reindeer
For the sleigh he's driving here
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow
On Christmas this year.

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted ?On Dasher? and each reindeer?s name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.

They never let poor Rudolph

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered, ""mañana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered, ""mañana""
For our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white, by candlelight, she knelt to pray
But the mission bells told me, that I mustn't stay

With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can!""

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment when they heard him holler, ""Stop!""

But he waved goodbye saying, 'Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday.'

See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)

You know I'm so lonely (Come see about me)
I love you only (Come see about me)

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Somewhere you've seen
Too real to ignore

To the white of their fear

Changed hands, was sold
This heat of love has turned ice-cold

Like flames reaching out from the sun
We can't defeat it
Like flames reaching out from the sun

From the garden of love,
Been banished too long
And the balance will shift
Between the week and the strong
Once they would beg and they would plead
But now they demand
Divided by those that need
And those that command

The freedom bought,
Changed hands, was sold
The heat of love has turned ice-cold and
We never learn but we know too well
Heaven's died and gone to hell

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair

Made promises to meet again
But her friends down at the French café
Had no English words for me

She'll leave you lost one rainy morn, you won't be the same

The streets that I walk on depress me
The ones that were happy when I was with you 
Still with all the friends I know and with all the things I do 
It's so hard being here without you being here without you",Here Without You,1967
Gene Clark,"I'd like to love you 
With all of my heart
You've had me on your trip 
Right from the start
And when you looked at me 
With love in your eyes
I knew I'd want you, oh yeah.

I'd like to hold you 
If you want me to
I've found somethin' new girl 
Just by lookin' at you
And it's in your smile 
And it's in the way 
I knew I'd want you, oh yeah

I meet so many people
I feel I don't know
But I felt so close to you
When you said hello

I'd like to love you 
And together we'd find
The place we've been looking for 
Where we'd have peace of mind
And there we'll be happy 
And there I'll know why
I knew I'd want you, oh yeah, oh yeah",I Knew I'd Want You [Remix],1967
Gene Clark,"If I need you to me your everything
If I have you if I love you just the same 
If your here the night is likely going to fall 
If your gone I'll see the daylight in that song

If I stand alone understanding what is now 
If I ever need someone to show me how 
If the daylight can be hidden by the sun 
If your gone then I'll know why I miss someone
 
If I love you if I know how much I care 
If I find the things you wanted anywhere 
If I know you I may never know your name 
If your gone then there is nothing that remains",If You're Gone [Remix],1967
Gene Clark,"Is yours is mine 
Inside misunderstanding lines you have gone 
Maybe there's time for something more than what we've done 
Wishing not to hold you down with iron binds 
Is this day and this time 
Is yours is mine 
I walked along the walls and there I saw your name 
I choose to spend my feelings chance, play the game 
The stormy weather passed and left me here to find 
That the rain and the shine 
Is yours is mine 
Is yours is mine",Is Yours Is Mine [Remix],1967

Don't let 'em bring you down

Gene Clark,"The warm wind will not blow tonight
For the the fog enshrouds 
The landing light
As she said she might have heard 
A bell tolling
Though a gold ship 
Sails her clouds and dreams
Through the crashing seas 
She finds it seems
That the shore she's looking for 
Is hardly showing
Oh what is this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone, 
Bringing her, her everything
Her paralytic agencies
Twist their tongues into philosophies
As petite Colombe asks only 
What she's been stealing
The tapestries that drape her walls
And the heroes she has witnessed fall
While the hallway leaves them 
All blank to the ceiling 
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone, 
Bringing her, her every dream
Beneath the deep and broken wall
The reflecting glass of time it falls
Through the crack she said 
She heard the ocean calling
The foghorn cries profanity
At the master of insanity
As she watches ruins, needing me and sobbing
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone, 
Bringing her, her everything.",Only Colombe [Remix][#],1967

I thought that maybe you'd see me 
Knowing there'd be changes 
Is this the way it was to be

Was it only something that we had to say 
Last night I remember 
You looked as though you really cared 
Today not the same one 
You had another face prepared 
The magic of those things we'd seen 
Vanished with the words that we were supposed to mean 
I called up your name and 
Maybe its true that you don't know me

So you say you lost your baby 
Do you know that your the one 
With the stand to watch the trials go, 
From here to there behind the scene 
Throw your troubles to the moon trolls 
To swallow up like stormy dreams 
Take an entrance to a stand-off, 
Looking if there's such a strife 

And you say you lost your baby, 
Wondering if its in your life 
Well you fly your banners Mondays, 
That take a rise and fall in one 
Ask the questions of the pilgrims, 
As they come to pledge what's done 
Claim a tabernacle hillside

I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone 
Cause she is moving somewhere far away not slow 
And though I tried so hard to please her 
She said she really had to go 
Even though this time it really hurts me bad 
I've been through similarities 
It's not the first break I've had 
And I just can't let it bring me down too low 
And though I tried so hard to please her 
There must be something more to know 
Never thought that we would end this way 
It seemed that everything was going fine 
Still with all the things that I can do or say 
It won't change the fate I know so well is mine 

So I'll stop and look right past the pain

While she is moving somewhere far away not slow

She said she really had to go",Tried So Hard [Remix],1967
Gene Clark,"You know I'm wanting to see her
I've looked all over town
Because I really did need her
That it was going 'round
Kinda gives you the feeling you've been used
When its only a matter of things that's been confused
Well now, she wasn't no loser
If you will investigate
But if you're thinking to choose her
You better think when its late
I'm beginning to feel she's not around at all
Had me running high strung, feeling small
Nobody could find her though they looked that day
What kind of thought had designed her
Go on out on a cloud
They say that's where she would stay
Well, I couldn't believe her
No, I couldn't believe her
I couldn't believe her
No, I couldn't believe her
I couldn't believe her",Couldn't Believe Her,1967
Gene Clark,"On the streets you look again
At the places you have been
Or the moments that you thought
Where am I going
Though the walls are like the dead
They reflect the things you've said
And the echoes in your head continue showing
Near the castles you can build
Out of dreams you half fulfilled
Won't keep out all of the ill wind that is blowing
And you look still for a trace
Of an opening in a place
Where you find the life that you were used to knowing
You can walk out in the night
And be sure that its alright
To exaggerate the world that's only being
You can watch Regina dance
Through the crystal panes of glass
Yet you know that there's so much that she's not seeing
Still you hold one precious thought
After all this time you've sought
That she might be just protecting what she longs for
And her eyes are veiled with black
Cause she plays she can look back
At the love she wanted so but says is no more
The lights go on, commence the cold
As your senses will be sold
To the parrot watchers mimicing no reasons
To pretend that what they are
From the fact completely far
While the truth may be betrayal, lies and treason
Build their towers in the sand
Down the roads at their command
When the kingdom is the innocence they're stealing
And infection easily spreads
To the searching, twisted heads
As they team up to tear down each others feeling",Echoes,1967
Gene Clark,"She was an elevator operator she had  her ups and downs
She got so high so very fast it took her all day to come down
I'm gonna put you straight to her right now
She's very busy but I'll explain somehow

She was one of the girls that you make feel 
That you were up to stay

She took you down all the way

I'm gonna have to get along without her now",Elevator Operator,1967

I could feel you close to me across the room
Last night, oh all right

What went down there I knew could never leave me
It was that feeling, girl, I got from you
Last night, oh all right
I found you

It's been much too easy to remember sometimes
How empty handed loneliness can be
But when you were there to ease my mind
There was so much of something that I need

And a song so sweetly sounding
And gentle souls who think not to defeat
As across the waves they are bounding

And then the thoughts of all the days this time
They have been confined without reason
And in the matters of their health and wealth
They cannot be defined but as treason
But go where and find the better life
As in the name of love you have freed them
And those you need not you have left behind
And those you keep in mind you know to heed them

So many different places
I remember there's more than one kind.

From a place that I can call my home
Down the road that I must call my own
I see no easy way

I don't mind seeing what I'm being shown

I watch them out of sight

Gene Clark,"I came into town on a Monday morning
The tall buildings breaking up the city sky
The streets were wet it had just been pouring
Like the clouds above the storm just had to cry
I trained my eye on a police cruiser
I watched and I gulped as he passed me by
I looked around to see the street lights changing
And a voice down deep inside me asked me why
Running through my thoughts
Were the memories of the days that I had left behind
Way down in my soul were the hope
That better days were always there to find
The fog rolled in and the lights grew dimmer
And the sound of the city streets seemed amplified
In the misty morning when it had just been pouring
Like the clouds above the storm just had to cry
Like the clouds  above the storm just had to cry",In a Misty Morning,1972

To go up to my white walled room out on the end of time
Where I can be with my love for she is all that is mine

I laugh with her, cry with her, hold her close she is mine
The way she tells me of her love and never is she trying

Cast adrift upon a wave
To be living and make life begin

Like the ancient mystic ship
Bounding seaward toward the sun
Becomes a cosmic dancer in the wind

Stars that shine and rains that swirls
Sparkling sands of endless worlds
Driven by the thought that men are free

Love that makes and breaks a man
Memories fade and new ones stand
And another ship bounds through the sea

Like in dreams sometimes it's so confusing to change
When you move from where you have been
To where you have come
Like in life when you look in to a child's eyes
They see it's all very clear
It's near and then gone

Before the simple rhymes of men were sung

Keeping by his side

Left me coming down with only lonely Saturday
I could take a walk uptown
I could have a drink or two with some old friends of mine
But they'd ask me how she's been
I don't think that I could take it I would die inside
I can live without a lot but living without her has something new to say

To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach

Down on the range where they graze

My face torn by sand storms and pride
Loyalty riches and inner bred ditches ?
Was the brew that I drank as a child
So rebellious a lover
Don Juan as a my cover
They die cast my type called me wild ?
And I just ride in from a hard southwestern drive
The hanging tree is waiting for me to arrive

Structured political our children they ridiculed
They teach them of sins and to lie
Their schools build't by fools but by breaking the rules
Like A fox I am forced now to hide
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive
My lips parched and bloodied
My face torn by sand storms and pride
Pepper tree spreads taking many mans heads ?

Sitting silently at will
Like some prophecy forgotten by an age
With no guns before its gate
The mysterious estate
Lies waiting for its history's dawning page
With the raging of the sea before its height
And the strength of those whom see beyond their sight
Oh, the smithies anvil rings
And the symphony it sings
No voice nor poet's pen can put to tune
And electric lines of force
Ring around the humble lives
Of the souls that hear the master saying soon
With the clouds that gather near disturb the night
Striking flashes of a difference, fleeing fright
No slight of tongue nor hand
Can so boldly there withstand
When the spirit of it's truth shall speak the time
And no ignorance of life
Can be held within the sight
Of the buttresses of ageless binds of time
The communion of the forces take delight
With the fear that no   tongues may read nor write
White Light
Oh the village of the hill
Sitting silently still
With the strength of ages past they're still at hand

And to hear of those enlightened by the lamb
With the powers of the wind both fierce and light
And the waters of the storm went through the night",White Light,1997

Why ever should we be somewhere
Where there's nowhere to go

Gene Clark,"I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would've stayed home,
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone.
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with ev'ry breath,
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death.

I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain,
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
Whose tears are like rain,
Who eats but is not satisfied,
Who hears but does not see,
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me.

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud,
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood,
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass.
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass.",I Pity the Poor Immigrant,1998
Gene Clark,"When I was a young boy evening sun went down
Stand off by the railroad tracks 
And I'd listen for the sound
Of that Kansas City Southern man 
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was outward bound
Well I'd dream about big cities
And the pleasures I would keep
Long about twelve-thirty through phase of my sleep
I'd hear that Kansas City Southern man 
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was outward bound
Well now I've been in a couple of places
Seen a couple of things
Whenever I think back in time
My memory rings

Gene Clark,"Struck by the sight of waking dreams
At hand our time's before our eyes
Called out to look beyond what seemed
To hear the woe an angel cry
In the distance the sun rose 
Near we heard a clock chime
But the breeze murmured not yet 
For there still is just a very little time

Our faces drenched by pouring rain  
We laughed as closely we had clung  
Our senses keen from lack of pain
Our souls the streams of songs we sung
Now the shadings around us 
Judged yet not by our sight
In the light of our questing
The truth came through more clearly into sight

Around the eyes of disbelief 
Intoxicated by their doubt
Moreover offered no relief
Afraid to look for finding out
Yet some danced and some sang songs
And some live for today
And around us the windows
Of wonder were unshuttered on our way",Opening Day,1998

Breaks me down to see you in the pains of fear 
The depths of your stone true eyes 
Are reflecting every burden of this life we bear 
My words can`t slide the truth to you 
Tomorrow every trial of life is going to fall 
 
I can only make guesses 
On some of my past addresses 
And tell you what my broken memory recalls. 
 
The first time I saw you 
My heart became the ruler of my mind 
The shadows of your motions 
Lingered way beyond the statements I intended timed 
The tears you hold from flowing 
Are the blood of the saints that shield the broken heart",Past Addresses,1998

When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind     
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind  
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be  
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time
               
I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand

The sea of time has tossed about
And I know that there's only one skipper

See within and then without
Silently the truth speaks more loudly
Than what falls from my mouth
Seems my dreams are the wings of a spirit
This vessel sails can't fill without
From it's wind comes the light of inspiration
And the darkness of doubt
Gales of anger that wane into the calm.
Please take me drifting far away
From the wordy and worldly explanation
Of this space we call today.

Far above the the darkened waters far above the troubled sky

Of the sea beyond the stars
And the sky beyond the sunbeams and the world  beyond your dreams
Have you seen the old world dying
Which was once what new worlds seem
Have you seen the silver raven she has wings that barely gleam
They barely gleam they barely glimmer
As she circles past the sun
And she tries to tell her sister that her trials  have just begun

Fields of corn on early summer mornings
Or late afternoons

Where life seemed not so soon

Your sweet loving tenderness
Easing my pride

Nothing is important lost, that's not easy to believe

To find what she was looking for
To identify, to really try
To  find herself  some hope
With the summer sun for laughing             
And the winter rain did pour
She was lovelier from learning
And from living, loving more
From her dancing love and young soul
And the gypsies in her dream
To the pulse of stark acceptance
When the winds began to freeze          
With no curfews left to hold her
And no walls to shield her pain
Finding out that facts were older
And that life forms are insane.
The presence of protection seemed
To fade, as did her doubt
That she now was no exception
Nor was the love who pushed her out
           
Though the streets cried out,
Go, homesick
Virtues strength of mind would ring
In the maladies of meaning
The sad song she learned to sing.
Now, her teachers and philosophers
And the poet's silver throat
Are the vessels which on wisdom's karmic  ocean she will float.

Just a child in love's crusade,
With the question in her innocence
Through the lies her eyes betrayed?",The Virgin,1998

Am I so changed from some strange love that went before

You will never lose me

If the human race is
Full of happy faces
It's because they all love
That wonderous thing, they call love

He loves and she loves
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love too?

Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love
And that's what we both should do

[Repeat: 2X]
Oh I always knew, someday you'd come along
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong
Hear me, he loves and she loves
And they love, so won't you
Love me as I love you?",He Loves and She Loves,1997
