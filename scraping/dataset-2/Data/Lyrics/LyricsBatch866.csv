Pug Uglies,"Oh mama don't walk away
I'm a goddamn sore loser
I ain't too proud to stay

But I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

Oh mama don't leave me alone
With my soul sat down so tight it's like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you

I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind

To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing

Yes'n I try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad
To see you now with him
Is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can
An I will stand here

And burn in my skin
Yes I will stand here
And burn in my skin",Burn,2005
Puggy,"Remember when the nights had no end
The moon was made for us to keep
The winter came the cold the rain
And we did nor complain
We had our empty streets
And that's why

I wish I could build a world for you
I wish I could wish a world for you
And give your everything your heart desires
As everyone you know will tell you

Before the days could get away
We trapped them in out sleep
So they could never leave
The years were scared,
Never dared lay a hand on us
Time was hours to heave

Remember when the nights had no end
And life was all we had to eat
We stole the clocks and hid them all
Behind a crooked lock
And kept out empty streets
And that's why",Empty Streets,2010

Is a day for which I care

No no you're not alone
When there's someone you can hold
Someone who is there

Pulley,"Great aspirations often fall too short to fly.
Life alone can take us on its twisted path
As we wander down this road not all sure where to go.
Sometimes the scenery can just bore you to death.

As I sit down to write, another day has passed me by,
They all seem the same anymore with so little time to live,
And so much time to kill, how's it
That I still find so much time to be bored?

Am I wasting time, is my purpose being served,
Am I part of a bigger master plan?
Today is all I have, can't change yesterday.
Strolling down this road again,

Life has made me cynical, it's taught me about its pain.
Is the little blue man using me for him?
I guess I know the answer already,
So does he, but when he goes he'll know if his sin was sin.

I guess for now the only answers
That I'll get will be the ones I can figure out myself.

On my notes tell me what they'll mean.

Splitting up the difference between one and two
Doesn't make a difference between me and you
What the signs they say the trucks are weaving back
And forth on any day but Sunday at four o' clock
And the meter's running too late
Now put your quarter in and you know you won't be found.

I know inside that you're afraid of me
I've become all the things
That I said I would be something more

I've seen it before.
The sun won't make things any brighter no more.

Like this is for sure. look through the window,
The clouds they look back,

Reflections all pass by the moments I've lapsed.

There's another night to fear.
No sleep for days, no pills to take,

Like the nothing before. the t.v.

Set it occupies my wasted time,
Until anxiety it finds me and it starts to get me down.
So I sit here and I sink a little deeper
I am crippled by security that keeps me safe and sound.

The t.v. set my only friend my artificial sun,
On for hours on end. my window on a world,
I just don't see my simulcast life of monotony
New generation futures in my hands,

Infrared remotes obeying my command.
Another night of nothing,
Just like the nothing before.
I got no ties that'll bind still I can't make up my mind,

I've got no place to go,
That I can leave this place behind neurosis starts to breed
I can feel it eating me,
Another visit from my old friend anxiety.

Get up, walk away, then I'm reminded
While I stay. I got no place to go to end all this dismay,

I can't bear to look at

Do you ever remember me
All those things we planned to be

Those times I held you late at night?
Now I am to you only a memory
Four years and counting that's all I am
It's just wasted time gone by

I can't explain the way I feel inside
This loneliness grabs me and won't let me go
And I've got nowhere to hide
I was twenty two years old

And didn't have many friends
You'd taken everything from me

Money standing in our way,
Where can we turn now?

Knowing things won't change.

Pulley,"So we trade our lives in for that fragile piece of mind
That tells us everything is gonna be okay.
We work our lives away and keep our savings saved,
And wait inside for a rainy day.

But all that time the sun is shining.
All those days are lost we convince ourselves
We need a purpose, and when it's not too clear
Why all of us are here we follow the path that's made for us.

And we'll sit around
And wonder what has happened to our lives
When we realize that our purpose has no purpose,
That the lives we could have had we all left for dead

When we let our lives be lived for us.
I once knew a girl who wanted all the world
But she settled for the simple life instead,
After years of nine-to-five,

That yearning feeling died she joined the ranks of the living dead.
And all that time the sun was shining all her days were lost,
She'd convinced herself she'd need a purpose,
And when it wasn't clear,

The reason she was here she followed just like a lot of us.

So I asked him 'how far?' he said 'as far as you'll go,'
I just couldn't say no.
It was a Thursday in December or was it September,
The last thing I remember was the cloudless sky above.

He said he saw a good friend die,
I never thought to ask him why.
I could have sworn I heard him say he knew who did it.
We headed off into the dead air of the desert

To a place I've never known.
He looked into the sun that shone above us
Then he smiled and spoke how good it was.
Yet things change and they stay the same.

Home sweet home,
There was a stillness as the light set behind us
The last thing I remember was the laughter in my ears,
Fearless yet fearful I stared into his eyes

I can't make a decision for the life of me

Losing my bout with this life no doubt
Or am I really just succeeding?
I'm a afraid of getting older, I feel it getting colder
Just please don't give me eternity

Follow me on my wasted journey
I got two ways, I can bring you down
One's for leavin', two's for stayin'
Either way

Don't you ever learn from your own interpreter
That a lifestyle is begging for mercy
I can't understand when it's all in my hands
I don't see it, I don't feel it

As long as I remember, I will always treasure
Those times that I actually felt happy
But for now, I stand proud and never speak loud
And hide all my insecure feelings

Follow me on my wasted journey
I got two ways, I can bring you down
One's for leavin', two's for stayin'
Either way

Falling prey to your own bad habit
You realize it's time to get out
Happy now but not quite
I'm just a little too tired right now

Falling prey, falling prey
Don't follow me

Frozen feelings have always been your being
But the guilt always finds a way in
Not a tear flows through, not a thought
Not a sound and numbness overwhelms me

Solo now, I can only reach out for a stray flier
On my high wire and from the ground to the air
It goes totally unnoticed
Isn't it just like that, so typical

Pulley,"A different pain when the axe falls on you
Watching hurt from far away.
Can only make us blue.
My life is only mine
And no one really cares if every day,
I hit that peel and stumble down the stairs.
You don't know you don't know the pain.
You can't feel the same.
Many things I want,
That I will never get.
Go through my life without even a little regret.
Some things I need will never come to me
Even if I kneel and pray and squeeze my rosary.
You don't know the pain.
You can't feel the same.
In this life you're always on your own.
Nobody really hears a cry of pain
That sounds like it's alone,
Sounds like it's alone.

Long day...tired and sore, abused my body,
Troubled...I find no peace in what I'm paid.
Distracted...the TV takes me from my worries.
Absent...of any progress I have made.
I am nothing more than a dreamer, wasting my life.
Consumed with my passion,
Caught in a world of debts and decisions.

I'm not a creature in a circus freak show

Going places where I've only dream to go
Waste my time with that
Brighten up this picture one day
Make me laugh

Trying something
What has not been done before
There's nothing left to do
Not asking myself to do anything

What if once I've started building something up
Just to watch it fall, pick it up again
See the pieces right in front of me
Pick it up again, I'm on my way

And never watch it pass you by,
The carpets rolling out for you.

Should be only what you hear,

Never do anything that anyone would accept.

What we do today is what we used to do before.

It's been years and years
And years gone by without a solid plan

Digging deep for motivation, why it seems so hard to find
He's been living like this for, oh, so long
This way of life is stuck in his mind

A good kick in the ass is what he needs
No one hears his silent pleas
Although people around him would tend to agree
A life of living like this is a bad disease

A will for change is a thought desired
To achieve his goals, to take him higher
In his thoughts he seems to care
But laziness lingers in the air

A fresh breath not polluted with this disease
I can hear him screaming saying pleas, please, please
Help me now, take me by the hand
This rut I'm in, makes me so bland

A good kick in the ass is what he needs
No one hears his silent pleas
Although people around him would tend to agree
A life of living like this is a bad disease

I cannot help but feel depressed.
I doubt that anyone would miss me if I wasn't around,
I don't need to know about the things in life that I can't find.
I don't need to know about the things I left behind.
I'm just a lazy slob, I should go out and get a job.
But I won't cause I know that my rent is paid.
I'm a big procrastinator, I can always do it later.
My friends all tell me that I got it made,
It doesn't really matter. what I have to say,
No one's fucking listening anyway.
So until my days are done, or it's no longer any fun.
I'm gonna bore you to death. life is overrated,
I really want to be sedated.
But I change the channel, and I'm watching days of our lives.
It's so sophisticated, watching programs that I hated.
But I guess it's better than working 9-5.

For five vanished days.

Ridiculing and mocking everything I held dear.

Will be spinning,

Is your feet.

Making a mockery of our former emotions.

When you lived on Stanhope Road.
We listened to your sister,
When she came home from school,

And she had boys in her room.
We listened outside and heard her.

Alright.
Well that was alright for a while,
But soon I wanted more.
I want to see as well as hear,
And so I hid inside her wardrobe.
And she came round four,
And she was with some kid called David,
From the garage up the road.
I listened outside I heard her.

I want to give you children.
You might be my girlfriend, yeah.

When I saw you next day,
I really couldn't tell,
'cause you might go and tell your mother.
And so you went with Neve,
And Neve was coming on,
And I thought I heard you laughing,
When his Mum and Dad were gone.
I listened outside, I heard you.
Alright.

Oh I want to take you home.
I want to give you children.
You might be my girlfriend, yeah.

Well I guess it couldn't last too long.
I came home one day,
And all her things were gone,
I fell asleep inside.
I never heard her come.
And then she opened up her wardrobe,
And I had to get it on.

Oh, listen
We were on the bed when you came home,
I heard you stop outside the door.

""I was only about eleven when this happened. 
We were living in a big block of flats with a central courtyard. 
All the bedroom windows opened onto this court, 
And sometimes in the middle of the night,
In that building it sounded like a mass orgy. 
I may have only been eleven, 
But no-one had to tell me what all that moaning and yelling was about. 
I'd lie there mesmerised, listening to the first couple. 
Invariably, they'd wake up other couples,
And like some kind of chain reaction, 
Within minutes the whole building was fucking.
I mean, have you ever heard other people fucking, and really enjoying it?
It's a marvellous sound. 
Not like in the movies, but when it's real. 
It's such a happy, exciting sound.'

The whole city getting stiff in the building heat.

Oh babe oh I'm sorry 
But I had to make love to every crack in the pavement and the shop doorways
And the puddles of rain that reflected your face in my eyes. 

The day didn't go too well. 
Too many chocolates and cigarettes. 
I kept thinking of you and almost walking into lamp-posts. 
Why's it so hot (Peace garden!) 
The air coming up to the boil; rubbing up against walls and lamp-posts trying to get rid of it.
Old women clack their tongues in the shade of crumbling concrete bus shelters. 
Dogs doing it in central reservations and causing multiple pile-ups in the centre of town. 
I didn't want to come here in the first place
But I've been sentenced to three years in the Housing Benefit waiting room.

Tonight must be the night it ends
Tomorrow she will call her friends and go out on her own somewhere
Who needs this shit anyway?

And listen, I wandered the streets the whole night crying, trying to pick up your scent
Writing messages on walls and the puddles of rain reflected your face in my eyes.
We finally made it on a hill-top at four a.m. 
The whole city is your jewellery-box; a million twinkling yellow street lights. 
Reach out and take what you want, you can have it all.

and listen to the blood rushing in your ears
and the soft ""tick, tick, tick"" of your watch against the mattress springs
Patterns merge behind your eyes
Purple and green, glowing gently
and all is soft with furry darkness
You yawn once 
turn on your side
and fall to sleep again

They wait alone
they bathed your eyes 
when nights were cold

Just give us a kiss to celebrate here today""

Creeping slowly past the cooling towers, 
Deserted factories, looking for an adventure,

Maybe we, maybe we can touch the sky, do you think that we can, 
Do you think that we can, touch the sky, please, I know, 
I know it's not forever, but tonight I don't care,

I took you there once; I think it was after the Leadmill. 
The water was dirty & smelt of industrialisation
Little mesters coughing their lungs up & globules the colour of tomato ketchup. 
But it flows. Yeah, it flows. 
Underneath the city through' dirty brickwork conduits
Connecting white witches on the Moor with pre-raphaelites down in Broomhall. 
Beneath the old Trebor factory that burnt down in the early seventies. 
Leaving an antiquated sweet-shop smell & caverns of nougat & caramel. 
Nougat. Yeah, nougat & caramel. 
And the river flows on. 
Yeah, the river flows on beneath pudgy fifteen-year olds addicted to coffee whitener
And it finally comes above ground again at Forge Dam: the place where we first met.

I went there again for old time's sake
Hoping to find the child's toy horse ride that played such a ridiculously tragic tune. 
It was still there - but none of the kids seemed interested in riding on it. 
And the cafe was still there too
The same press-in plastic letters on the price list & scuffed formica-top tables. 
I sat as close as possible to the seat where I'd met you that autumn afternoon. 
And then, after what seemed like hours of thinking about it
I finally took your face in my hands & I kissed you for the first time 
And a feeling like electricity flowed through' my whole body. 
And I immediately knew that I'd entered a completely different world. 
And all the time, in the background, the sound of that ridiculously heartbreaking child's ride outside.

At the other end of town the river flows underneath an old railway viaduct
I went there with you once - except you were somebody else - 
And we gazed down at the sludgy brown surface of the water together. 
Then a passer-by told us that it used to be a local custom to jump off the viaduct into the river
When coming home from the pub on a Saturday night. 
But that this custom had died out when someone jumped 
Landed too near to the riverbank 
Had sunk in the mud there & drowned before anyone could reach them. 
I don't know if he'd just made the whole story up, but there's no way you'd get me to jump off that bridge. 
No chance. Never in a million years.

Yeah, a river flows underneath this city
I'd like to go there with you now my pretty & follow it on for miles & miles, below other people's ordinary lives.
Occasionally catching a glimpse of the moon, through' man-hole covers along the route. 
Yeah, it's dark sometimes but if you hold my hand, I think I know the way. 
Oh, this is as far as we got last time 
But if we go just another mile we will surface surrounded by grass & trees & the fly-over that takes the cars to cities.
Buds that explode at the slightest touch, nettles that sting - but not too much. 
I've never been past this point, what lies ahead I really could not say. 
I used to live just by the river, in a dis-used factory just off the Wicker 
The river flowed by day after day
""One day"" I thought, ""One day I will follow it"" but that day never came
I moved away & lost track but tonight I am thinking about making my way back.

A horror soundtrack from a stagnant water-bed
And it sounds just like this.
This is the sound of someone losing the plot 
Making out that they're okay when they're not.
You're gonna like it,
But not a lot
And the chorus goes like this:

Oh baby,
Here comes the fear again.
The end is near again.
A monkey's built a house on your back. 
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack
Oh here we go again.

So now you know the words to our song,
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along.
When you're sad, when you're lonely
And it all turns out wrong.
When you've got the fear.

And hen you're no longer searching 
For beauty or love 
Just some kind of life
With the edges taken off.
When you can't even define what it is that you're frightened of
This song will be here.

Oh baby,
Here comes the fear gain.
The end is near again.
If you ever get that chimp off your back.
If you ever find the thing that you lack
But you know you're only having a laugh
And here we go again.
Until the end.","The Fear [Live in Birmingham, October 31, 2001]",2006

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003

[Pumpkinhead]
Welcome aboard the Underground Railroad, I'm your captain
I'm gonna explain the reason why I keep on rappin
Why I keep on movin, doin shows in Manhattan
Knowin in my heart, that I'll probably never go platinum
See it's for the love, music is in my protoplasm
I can only wish but I don't have a genie and my name's not Aladdin
Fasten your seatbelts, we're takin off soon
I'm gonna rock rock on, on a rocket to the moon
Start a label up there, sign an alien rappin clique
Sell a million units, and get paid in amethyst
Cause on this planet, reality doesn't exist
You'd rather sell souls than to sign some real shit
But I refuse to put it in park so I'm shiftin the gears
Even though time flies, I'm 28 in years
That's about 10 thousand and 2200 months
Spittin heat for ten years and haven't been signed once
How I'm 'sposed to blow up, when independent labels front
Don't pay up, don't promote, your record label sucks
You got MC's out there that deserve to get put on
So for them, I'm gonna rock rock rock on

[Pumpkinhead]
At first, I wanted to paint, so I went to art school
Then I saw heads rappin, bangin on tables in the lunchroom
In a cypher, they were playin some hot beats
And these heads rappin was C-Rayz Walz and Mobb Deep
Yeah - I went to school with them dudes
And they dropped out, and eventually I did too
I formed a crew with a group named Doom, they call 'em Hydra now
And they even sound liver now
So me and Blitzkrieg, now we got Park Slope on lock
That's when I battled, this Puerto Rican cat named Block
And we battled, he beat me, I was impressed with his flow
He saw potential, so we broke bread and smoked 'dro
This ain't fake, trust me this is a real tale
Block had a group called Zooty Zoo and introduced me to Will Tell
We did a track with Medaphoar and shit clicked rapidly
Then Block said let's form the Brooklyn Academy
So we did, kids flipped, they loved our songs
We were like Pink Floyd, Run-D.M.C. and Cheech & Chong
Then Black Panther Marco Polo came along
So now we gon' rock rock rock rock on

I rock for Brooklyn, Park Slope, that's my home

I rock for the b-boys and the DJ's
I rock for MC's and writers, catchin tags on the freeway
I rock for my dad and my uncles, rest in peace
I rock for my grandma Isabel who's also deceased
I rock for those who died, and those who are alive
I rock for my mom and sis they helped me to survive
I rock for my wife, she brought our son in our life
I mean it so sincere that I'm sayin it twice
I rock for my wife, she brought our son in our life
I rock for him like when I rock him to sleep at night
I rock for the Ak, my family, in these dark days

Jetzt wird das alte Rudel aufgemischt, der Untergrund bereinigt
Alte Hasen gegen Wölfe, ich hab Hunger, will was reißen
Dieser Kampf wird mehr als blutig
Dieser Kampf wird legendär

Doch sie handeln nicht danach und wollen dabei, dass was passiert

Aber meine Motive sind nunmal anders
Und keiner kann mir meine Wege hier blocken, weil ich immer weiter komme
Wenn ich meine Ziele einmal angepackt hab und zubeiß
Weil ich keiner bin, der seine Beute mit den falschen Leuten teilt
Denn ich habe lange genug einfach alles versucht um den Alphas zu gefallen
Aber diese Hierarchie ist nicht so mein Ding gewesen

Ich wurd' berühmt, doch war im Ghetto am Start
Denn ein paar Featureparts konnten Mamas Rechnung nicht zahlen
Und wer Beef mit mir wollte, brauchte nur ein falsches Wort sagen
Deutsche Gangsterapper killen ist eine meiner Vorstrafen
Solang man funktioniert, sind sie alle hochzufrieden
Nun dann wurd' ich totgeschwiegen, doch ich war nicht tot zu kriegen
Hab's getan, während eure Drohungen nur Drohung blieben
Rap ist mein Haus und du darfst dir keine Wohnung mieten
Keks bellen und denken, so macht man Rapgeld
Aber keiner hat mit 19 auf sein Konto sechs Stellen
Fahrt mal eure Filme und seit endlich zufrieden
Bin ich auch, denn jetzt sind es sieben

Schon als kleiner Junge hab' ich diese krassen Parts gespuckt
Und auf Klassenfahrt im Suff durch den Maschendraht geguckt
Schlage mich fast nie, hab auch nicht jahrelang gedealt
Doch trotzdem mein Ruf hinter meinen Namen so wie Nils, Habibi
Treff mich und Erol Abi in der Street
Und der Status in der Szene wird ab jetzt radikal gefreezet

Und jetzt ist Promophasen-Kickdown, die Jagdsaison geht los

Punch Brothers,"The leading lights of the age all wondered among themselves what I would do next,
After all that I'd found, in my circles around the world, was there anything left?
""Gentlemen,"" I said, ""I've studied the maps, and if what I am thinking is right,
There's another new world, at the top of the world, for whoever can break through the ice,""

I looked 'round the room, in that way I once had, and I saw that they wanted belief,
So I said, ""All I've got are my guts and my God,"" then I paused, ""and the Annabel Lee.""
Oh, the Annabel Lee, I saw their eyes shine, the most beautiful ship in the sea,
My Nina, my Pinta, my Santa Maria, my beautiful Annabel Lee

That spring we set sail, and the crowd waved from shore, and on board the sailors waved caps,
But I'd never had family, just the Annabel Lee, so I never had cause to look back.
I just studied the charts, set the course north, and towards dark I drifted toward sleep,
And I dreamed of the fine, deep harbour I'd find past the ice, for my Annabel Lee.

After that it got colder, and the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night.
And the sea turned the colour of sky turned the colour of sea turned the colour of ice.

After that all around us was vastness, one glassy desert of arsenic white,
And the waves that once lifted us, shifted instead into drifts against Annabel's sides.
And the crew gathered closer, at first for the comfort, but each morning would bring a new set
Of tracks in the snow, leading over the edge of the world, til I was the only one left.

And as the going got slower, colder and colder, my crew drifted closer to me,
At first for the comfort, but then it was more like the icebergs rammed Annabel Lee
As the floes shrieked her hull, the shouting began, and a mast snapped off in the wind,
And I woke up much later, my crew disappeared, and they never were heard from again

After that it gets cloudy,
But it feels like I laid there for days, or maybe for months
But Annabel held me, the two of us happy,
Just to think back on all we had done

I told her {We talked) of the other new worlds
We'd discover as she gave up her body to me,
As I chopped up her mainsail for timber,
I told her of all that we still had to see.
As the ice {frost} turned her moorings
To nine-tails and the wind lashed her sides in the cold,
I burned her to keep me alive every night in the loving embrace of her hold.

I can't {won't} call it rescue,
What brought me back here to this old world to drink and decline,
Pretend that the search for another new world was well worth the burning of mine.
But sometimes at night, in my dreams,
Comes the singing of some unheard tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep,
Thinking Annabel Lee's finally made it to the top of the world.

Through the fog of an early morning
With nothing more than a coffee filling up her sails

Daddy asleep in the bed he made the night before
Instead she cuts through the morning like a man-of-war, mmm

Through a night of his own diversions
Hoping to blaze half a second of a glowing trail

Pours rum on his weary heart
Says,""Hey, I'm closer than when I started""

Leaves a crater on the bedroom floor

The ebb and flow of their hope and worry
In every verse of a living, breathing fairy tale

As Momma rises and Daddy sets
Just like they have since the night I met them
I hear the clock tick, the wolf who loiters at the door

Or feel what it's meant to symbolize

Just wants the best for itself and its family

But now I realize it don't have to be so hard

Punchline,"Yeah once again presenting  
Kid Capri 
Ras Kass the waterproof M.C. 
Punchline 

These fagot M.C's be on skis with the microphone though 
But it's all downhill hitting trees like Sonny Bono 
Name a nigga I couldn't burn and he probably created the Earth in six days 
I shot at Jesus with a tech fives times 
Hanging the pope with six strings  the name is Ras Kass 
Might eat a little pussy but I don't kiss ass homeboy 
I'm righteous and wicked and this acquisition of riches is like 
Selling bean pods and still fucking white bitches 

I rap crazy, you better get fifty niggas to blaze me 
Or ace me, been rhyming since 220 AD 
You feel gazy?, I'm top ten with the raps 
Off the list you scratch, like serial numbers on gats 
I lace tracks with ill lines 20 bar rhymes 
My verses got long sentences like jail times 
Press rewind, listen to jams when I cool out 
I only fuck a bitch in the park if she juiced out 
Going new routes to maintain my composure 
Anticipated while you still screaming to get exposure 
Rap soldier in the cipher I'm first to set it 
My lyrics get the U.S. Open without playing tennis 

Vindictive my voice pitch is beyond John Blaze 
I'm John Cremation, you conversation with aspirations 
Of me leaving blood stains from Earth to Venus 
Them so-called rap stars will still be living 
with they moma like an unborn fetus 
As soon as you step on stage I'ma destroy you with the truth 
Like the Ricki Lake show, don't come out the soundproof booth 
Or poof, plucked in your bubblegoose 
A lost angel, I strangle at an angle that's obtuse 

Yo, my styles viscous, put niggas before bitches 
Collect riches, bone chickens without trickin' 
And stay spitting mad rhymes in your direction 
Always repping get you open like seasections 
I rhyme greata set it off without Jada 
My flava' leave a nigga shook like vibrators 
Rap composer of the hit your styles over 
I make an M.C. cry just like Robin on Ophra 
Give you the cold shoulder guess who rhymes slicker 
I gross figures, shed light on shady niggas 
And write rhymes, roast niggas that take mine 
Gave birth to so many styles I should have my tubes tied 
One time, when rappers need concentration 
Embarrass I nigga, like getting caught masterbating 
I'm fascinating, I make you wallow in your sorrow 
Clutch the bottle you get your childish style fondled 
My rap tactics make you want to go home and practice 
Match this, drop jewels like Biago Rackis 
I come rough for all niggas that front 
I'm all that five mics and quotable for the month 

I be on some bullshit like the unamits and vigorous rhyming 
And until Buchwhick Bill starts dunking on Kobe Bryant 
I'm applying pressure, check out my melody 
The eighteenth letter, the first letter 
the nineteenth letter for cheddar 
And get a barrette explosive tip shredders to make the rum-redder 
To make the deader then Coretta 
Scott King's husband who had a dream 
I get in you with no Vaseline 
And burn rubber so I tap that ass like Savion Glover  

That the sedative cause your shits repetitive 
And played out, tried to run game but it got rained out 
Wasn't thinking about this style until we came out 
Took a detour when some of y'all went the same route 
Thoughts about doing Punchline make me tickle 
When my flow changes like pennies, dimes and nickels 
Organized rhymes we make the girls realize 
We humiliate niggas like a small dick size 
Now you want to click nines, front and sip wines 
Take mine, can't mess with Ras and Punchline",One on One,1998
Punchline,"I try to find the words to say to you but I can't find them; so I'll just keep my mouth shut. I can't say what will make you go way because I don't want you to leave. But I can't see you and you won't hear me. I can't hold you anymore. To my surprise I open up my eyes and I hear your voice and I hear your lies, but I still want to be the one you dream about when you're lying in bed and you scream and shout that I should have been the one that was there and you should have been the one that cared, but I guess its too late and we're on bad terms but I've got to admit that it still hurts.

Maybe if I hadn't chased her to the door, then maybe she would have come back for more. All that I can say is if only, maybe if I quit saying maybe all the time then you'd be back and you'd be mine. Now I'm lost. I've been down this path before, but it hasn't been a while. I sit here and just think, about my life and how I never seem to win.

Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.

And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

I walk in the air between the rain,
Through myself and back again.
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying.
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here we always stand up straight
'Round here something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house, takes her clothes off,
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here we're carving out our names
'Round here we all look the same
'Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here she's slipping through my hands

Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head.""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head.""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling.""

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping.
She says she's tired of life;
She must be tired of something.

'Round here she's always on my mind
'Round here (hey man) I got lots of time
'Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very very very very late

Will you catch me because I'm falling down on here

Marked their facial expressions
Forgotten are emotions
And only hunger remains
Silent they are reeling

Breed of the demised
Signs of transistoriness
Deep inside

The names they had once
Besides after death
Names have no consequence
They won't recognize
Parents, children and friends
Memories are extinguished

Appearance are deceptive
They're able to crunch a thighbone

Eager for booty and foaming

I butcher them for fun
Or shoot them with my gun
I choke them with a string

When I murder I always sing
I scalp and take their hair
But before I ask them to be fair

I hack them and I slay

The day that I buried my family car
In the scrapmetal wrecking yard

And I've said so many goodbyes
In the 25 years that I've been alive
And I don't know why this one was so hard

And everytime when I go back to my apartment
All I wanna do is get stoned
And I'm sick and tired of blacking out on my carpet
And waking up all on my own
So I brought you home

You started falling apart
6 months after you moved in
And I shoulda known from the start
That things would be different

It's not something that I can fix
If I could do anything you know I would
If this fucking vacation would come to an end
Maybe then you'd be normal again

Last week when I went back to my apartment
You were lookin' so stoned
The day after christmas you acted so different
You just wanted to be on your own
So I bought you medicine, went to the vet and
Cashed all of my savings and loans
But it was too late. You were letting go

Woah oh oh

And nothing I say will make it ok
You just sleep in the heat and repeat
You're wasting away. And nothing I do is gonna save you
I'm trying my best but you can't even
Look at me or talk to me or tell me what's happening to you

Yesterday I went back to my apartment
To see how you've been holding up
You hadn't been eating, I thought you were sleeping, but
You're not waking up

Got bouncing beans, mashed money
In this cultural agri clash
Cows bite the grass like
It's covered in honey. Snuggles
The bunny, Sunny at last
Farmer gotta 45, that's a rabbit
On the runny path, fresh greens

The earth is a treasure box you might not be able to be
Payin' it back

Whenever he leaves his home behind hes like in a zoo in
A Cadillac cage
There's another side to what you think you own you better
Check it out cause

Them demons is always hungry and their voices might turn loud!

No, I'm going to hell

Hast do nichts dabei gefühlt
Was nahm dir all die Skrupel, all die Scham
Do hast gewissenlos gehorcht
Mord befohlen, ausgeführt
Das Gas war leise, nur die Schreie laut
Die Bilder machen fassungslos
Gruben voller Leichen
Voller nicht erfüllter Hoffnungen
Do hast als Richter, Henker
Ihre Zukunft geraubt
Wie kann ein Mensch zum Unmensch werden
Das höchste Gut mit Füßen treten
Chorus:
Leben- mehr als nur zu überleben
Leben- das ist Ursprung und Ziel
Leben- als kleiner teil des großen ganzen
Lebenswert zu sein
Daß I'm Namen einer Politik
Daß I'm Namen einer Religion
Menschenverachtung uns I'm Kriege führt
Und daß der Wahnsinn triumphiert
Wo ein Leben nur als Opfer dient
All das blieb uns bis jetzt erspart
Wir kennen nur die Bilder
Das genau ist unsere Chance
Wenn wir begreifen, wenn wir lernen wollen
Wie do und ich und wir gemeinsam

Geschrieben
Doch sie traut sich nicht,
Schickt ihn nicht ab

Nicht mag
Noch mal erträgt sie die
Blicke nicht
Die sie durchdringen, als wär
Sie nicht da
Was hat sie getan, warum straft
Man sie so
Und es fehlt nur, daß er
Lacht
Sie sieht makellos magere
Models
In Hochglanz, die Männer verzückt
Und verrückt
Sie träumt sich in
Liebesromane
Sinnlich und schön begehrt und
Beglückt
Sie sehnt sich nach Nähe,
Geborgenheit
Doch sie scheint nur als
Zaungast genehm
Warum kann sie denn keiner, so
Wie sie ist
Nur mit anderen Augen seh'n
?
Doch wer glaubt schon, daß Wunder
Geschehen
Und sie steht wieder allein vor
Dem Spiegel
Und sie weint hilflos in sich
Hinein
Und sie flucht mutlos - dann kocht
Die Wut hoch
Dieses Scheißleben ist wirklich
Gemein
Sie ist nun mal kein
Barbiepüppchen
Ihre Stärken sind leise,
Verdeckt
Die tollen, die ganz coolen
Typen
Fragen nie, was sie tut, wo
Sie steckt
Die Gleichgültigkeit und die
Hänselei
Hat sie immer geschluckt, nie
Verdaut
Daß sie wertlos und keinesfalls
Liebenswert sei
Hat sie irgendwann selbst
Geglaubt
Und sich schließlich nichts mehr
Zugetraut
Und sie steht wieder allein vor
Dem Spiegel
Da neulich I'm Bus, dieser junge
Mann
Mit Brille und nicht so ganz
Schlank
Er lächelte nett und er sprach
Sie an
Sie wies ihn ab ""NEIN"", vielen
Dank""
Vielleicht geht es ihm jetzt
Wie ihr
Hinter einer verschlossenen
Tür
Und sie steht wieder allein vor

Pur,"Es ist schön, Dich zu kennen
mit Dir zu reden oder auch Musik zu hören,
sogar Schweigen ist nie peinlich zwischen uns.
und das ist gut so.
Heucheln und Lügen ist sinnlos,
weil wir uns gegenseitig fast wie Glas durchschauen.
wir machen uns schon lange nichts mehr vor,
und das ist gut so.
do hast in meinem Arm geweint,
so manche Nacht mit mir durchträumt,
die letzten Zweifel ausgeräumt,
ich kenn' Dich und do mich.

do bist nicht hart I'm Nehmen,
do bist beruhigend weich,
Dich nicht zu mögen, ist nicht leicht.
do bist kein Einzelkämpfer,
do bist so herrlich schwach,
vertrau mir und benutz' mich,
wozu sind denn schließlich Freunde da.


Ich les' in Deinen Gesten,
und freu' mich, wenn Dein echtes Lachen klingt.
die Brücke zwischen uns ist gnadenlos belastbar,
und das ist gut so.
Wir kosten nun Nerven,
tauschen Ideen und manchmal auch das letzte Hemd,
philosophieren und saufen, und werden uns nie mehr fremd,
und das ist gut so.
wir haben uns versöhnt, verkracht, so manchen derben Witz belacht,
uns gegenseitig Mut gemacht,
ich brauch' Dich und do mich.

Ach, warum gehst do denn nicht ran?
Ich vermiß dich so.

Wie weit die Kraft doch reicht.
Wenn ich am Boden liege,

Seelen aneinander reiben.

Abgestürzt gestrandet neben dir.
Mein Glück, daß do Bruchpiloten magst.

Der nicht mal angefangen hat
Das Frühstück steht da wie verlor'n
Nicht angerührt
Und do bist durch die Tür.
Spür' die Träne I'm Gesicht
Laß es kommen
Wehr' mich nicht
In mir drin ist es so leer
Warum ist ein leerer Kopf so schwer?

Mit dir alt zu werden
Scheint ausgeträumt
Schmilzt wie Butter in der Sonne
Und der Tisch wird abgeräumt.

Es tut weh - einfach jedes Mal
Es tut weh - heut' ein bißchen mehr
Weil ich weiß
Alle Tränen der Welt
Und Versprechungen
Die man eh nicht hält
Bringen dich nicht mehr her.
Wir wollten alles und noch mehr
Doch daß es so zu Ende geht
So ganz gewöhnlich
Tut am meisten weh.
Do stehst vor mir und fragst mich: Wie heilt man Gefühlslegasthenie?
Ich weiß nicht mal
Wie man das schreibt und sage nur:
Es tut mir leid.

An plus up on my block, now it ain't gon' stop

Now I dash down the block but I keep my game tight
When I'm in the Rover, I gets the guests the same night
You try skeezin me, should be try pleasin me

While I write the words to rhyme
Just what I am thinking, and just what I should say
If I have to go, I'd rather stay

Colorado canyon girl who set me free
Brown eyes in the morning looking back at me
And just for that one moment, you're all that I see
Searching for some other place to be

More than anyone can try, I hope you'll see that I belong
Standing right before your eyes
If you can take the time to find where I went wrong
Then I think you just might realize

So sew your skirt lace and I'll go home
But not quite where I started from
And take it so you'll feel it, and take it so you'll know
Take one long last look before I go

Call me, tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't see things quite your way
But I think that I could show you
Things that lye below your thoughts and words
And your gardens and your stained glass day

Times you come to me and said you don't know why.
I think that there might be something wrong
You could change your thoughts before I go
But then you'd know that you were right where I wanted you
And you didn't know

You were meant to worship and accuse (chose)
Anything you want but now it looks like you will lose
All the things you needed when you were the one
Can't be found you know they've just begun
To crumble all around you
And you see them tumble down without a thought or care for you
Oh what you do

I can still feel all your sunlight shine before the dawn
First light morning feeling's got me losing so much sleep
I just can't say how much I miss you when you're gone

‘Cause I get a feeling something like a summer wind
When you love me like a sister, then you're gone again
But there's so much light shining in your eyes
That you just can't help but keep a love alive

Now I hear some other loving sunshine brother's
Left you crying and you're all alone
So dry your eyes and try and say your goodbyes
‘Cause you're old enough to get back on your feel all on your own

Don't you kind of get a feeling like a summer wind
‘Cause he loved you like a brother, now he's gone again

And you sure know how to keep a man alive

Well you can stand right there and tell me something's wrong
It's so hard to know your problems when you're gone

There's not much more I can do to try and make things right

Ball that spins in space

To find a common ground
It's still love

If the time meets far
Really makes a difference when they
See the days go dark

There it comes still happening
They go by but not to dare
To let a hopeless heart now
That we care

To let a hopeless heart now
That we care, (care)

Anything can change

To find a common ground

Trying to convince you that black was white again,
Oh you say you know
I know you don't

I've got a picture in my mind,
Sat on a chair near a broken blind with you,
A little scene left way behind,
Sat in the church of the broken spine with you.

Lay back watching football with no interest at all,
Why can't I just never see it through,

Tell me if I could be like I was last night again,
You could be wrong and be oh so right again,

Another one made twice the fun,
But you tried to do some digging and got buried,
Well its happened twice before
And you know it'll happen more,
Now I can't feel my legs like I'm being carried.

It doesn't matter if I
Try counting out on all my five fingers
Where I'm supposed to go
I tried hanging round with all the dead ringers
People I used to know.

I want you to know that I need it more.

Are the saints still alive since the last time?
At the end of the line
Was I cruel to be kind in a past life?
Sharpen up your knives.

Every day I chip at stone while you are on your way,
Up to the stars, up to the stars.

Any map in any station, pick a line and go !

You've always got the street lights,
Shining on your hard times,
Don't it make your shoes shine,
Starin at the street lights.

Hey street lights won't you save me?
Bringing down aircraft with your eyes don't amaze me.
The former number one contender
Squealing on a spike,
You keep screaming no surrender, go and ride your bike.

You've always got the street lights,
Shining on your hard times,
When the top one hundred earner's coffins have been nailed.
When you stop the lovely sisters opening your mail,
And when the reason you're drinking isn't solely to get wrecked.
It'll be hard times for something

They'll turn the lights out when I die.

And it's good to know you're with somebody half as good as me.
They'll put a statue up outside,
And I can watch with pharaohs eye's,
And then they'll all know I was somebody.

You've had your time now it's just about,
That time to give it in, 'cause someone's waiting to step right in.

Just standing in your pool of shade venere.
Here I am, still yellowed by the summer,
Still sufferin in silence loud and clear.

Well I catch the train, it takes me back
We leave the rails and the carriage snaps.

There I was, just lying in the kitchen,
Just listening to voices through the tiles.
And they said the one thing you can count on,
Is you can count on nothing here my child.

Well you dig my grave, and pat my back,
And I turn grey, on the beaten track.

But you hardly notice.

What do you say when they roll a grenade
And it almost takes your breath away.

And it all goes pear-shaped.

And it feels like we've got to shelter from the rain

You say that you can, but I'm more of a man
You can't hold me down
You say that you will, but I still got the will
You can't hold me down

And if everybody's mobile, why don't nobody move?
Just your Intel, hard-sell lifestyle disrupting your groove
I got a face down ball gown angel
I wish she were mine
And this analgesic love song that makes me drive blind

And it feels like I'm home again
And it feels like we've got to shelter from the rain

You say that you can, but I'm more of a man
You can't hold me down

At the dawn of the setting sun
All the seasons mingle into one
And everyone gets blood from stones

Puretone,"I got two pale hands up against the window pane
I'm shaking with the heat of my need again
It starts in my feet, reverbs up to my brain
There's nothing I can do to revert the gain
I'm looking down to the street below
There's nothing in the way, they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too hunger for the beast below
Listening to the radio I feel so out of place
There's a certain something missing that the treble can't erase
I know you can tell just by looking at my face
A word about my weakness

I'm totally addicted to bass
Wow woah ho
Totally addicted to bass
Wow woah ho

There's nothing I can do to be cool
I don't sleep 'til I've had my fuel
It frustrates if I am deprived
A hunger that grates from deep inside
I feel like I'm doing time
Imprisoned by dependence on a rhythm sublime
In my mind I must overcome the need to define
The solitary silence of a faceless crime

Standing by the stereo I'm feeling so alone
My back against a speaker and I'm moving on my own
Surrounded by so many and they're staring at my face
They're picking up my problem

I'm totally addicted to bass
Wow woah ho
Totally addicted to bass
Wow woah ho

Your bassline is shooting up my spine (wow woah ho)
Your bassline has got me feeling fine
It's filling up my mind

Your bassline is shooting up my spine (wow woah ho)
Your bassline has got me feeling fine
It's filling up my mind

Sunrise at my window, I look down on the street
People I see everywhere are tapping their feet
Suddenly I realise in a look that I was wrong
Everybody's groovin' to their own song
Down at the scene below
There's something in the way they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too hunger for the beast below

Rhythm's running over me to wash away my fears
The backbeat of humanity it sweetens my tears
There's something that's connected us down throughout the years
No need to feel so lonely, everyone's addicted to bass
Wow woah ho
Everyone's addicted to bass
Wow woah ho

Your bassline is shooting up my spine

With a reverence incurred
There was an echo far and faint
Beneath the air remained
You were young and you'd stare
Where my limbs hung far and fair

It's like when you lie down, the vein's growing slow
You push and you pull but you would never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

There was no light and I swear

I heard the planes moaning back
I saw the thunder roll or black

Purple Popcorn,"Uh,(don't cry) just follow me for a second 
Le let me take you all some place

(Verse 1)
I remember When I was young my momma said she was goin out
You see the problem is she was always going out
Grandma mad 'cause my mama left us in the house
She was grown but granny thought she was showin out 
Know you sayin damn they ain't shit to be mad to
My momma told me well that she did what she had to
But see I ain't like that she was datin them bad dudes
So everytime she went out I gave her an attitude
Yeah I was straight throwin a tantrum
Try to mess up her plans I was hopin she canceled
But ain't nobody told her what she could and she can't do
Yeah ma I was a handful so yeah
I cried and I cried and I tried to show her my side
But she wasn't hearin her kid took the key to the crib
Out the door she wavin bye bye
She had me thinking that my tears meant nothin'
Years later found out it means something
You see all those nights mama left me alone
I had to learn how to stand on my own (2 feet)

(chorus)
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride
And don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride (don't cry because its okay)

(Verse 2)
So now I'm grown up rap performer
Give thanks to the mirror where I practiced so much
Thanks to my grandma after so much
Sacrifice I feel so loved
And thanks to my auntie ann 'cause I be damned
If I ever said can't when I probly can
To my brother my blood my right hand man
Won't hesitate to put my life in yo hands
And this is to my young sis, 2 'cause nothing could stop you
Roy hand and troy p I ain't forgot you
My uncle joe and serita even my pops to
If I'm on top then we on top too
Chris and be you know that I got you
Will and ill see you know that I got you
The whole 6-4 you know that I got you
Black get yo hustle on I can't knock you
See-l slim and k be 
Niggas in the hood that failed to pay me
I still got love for you niggas don't know why
So I know the meaning of when mama said don't cry

(chorus)(2x)
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride

[Movie Quotes Intro]
Well this is the effect, all these films beginning ???
The kids are very impressionable.  Three?
They see all these films and they want to imitate their heroes.
What heroes though?
All they see is robbers, rapists, muggers, and murderers.
I'm impressed, you're a killer.

[Mr. Lif]
Yo
The plans' covered in asphalt
The Lord told me that its man's fault 
For perpetuating detrimental ways of living we can't halt
Everything inside ya move
You're caught inside a homicidal groove
Where only the idle loose
By violating one of life's most vital rules
Thou shalt not
But hell is a foul spot, where many are misinformed when they are taught
And thus cherish the untrue
Then die for the lies that they clung to
Del and I were there when they hung you
And as you swung to and fro 
We asked, (where did the humane humans go?)
With none in sight
We're left to focus on the same stunning fight
That spites the same force that put the sun in flight
So I summon night
The lack of light left some in fright
And living in fear
With something they couldn't bear
I promise to tell the truth and the whole truth
I solemnly swear

[Chorus 3x]
Left
Right
Up
Down
Diagonal
Three-hundred and sixty degrees

[Dj Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Progression, the lesson
I figure out which direction, then jettison
Minimalize perplexion
Flesh and bone, that's just a physical
I got a spiritual
Awareness, I have risen to
Its not mystical, something that I listen to
When these plastic motherfuckers try to get in-to
My cypher, I ciphen they blood like they split in two
Yeah, Del, repel, arduous
The purest, give 'em service
With no insurance
Evil
I see through, like cellophane
Knowledge of self, that's why people see Del is strange
They want to humanize the most demonic dudes
Apply harmonic rules
Decide, who is the guy
Americas'
Just like a pair of glove
Don't want to share with us
Anarchy, tear it up

[Chorus 3x]
[Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Mr. Lif then Del alternating stanzas]
The new era, brings terror
You wish the quality of life was better
Peep the dilemma

Yeah life's getting dimmer
Stomachs' gettin' thinner
But your souls keep you full, obesity is for sinners

The sentiment lingers
Low self-esteem hinders

I tell my people 'bout slavery, no one remembers

Maybe they ought to take a look in they mirrors

Like Michael Jackson, and they actions gettin' clearer

Beware, the imagery might scare ya

If you ain't close to the source, then you don't like prosperity

One or many waitin' in line for therapy

But everyone bear a seed
Pure as the air we breathe

TNT tucked in my 'rillo, hundred racks under my pillow
Different styles, I'm so versatile, nigga you know like I know

Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby
Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind

I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick, magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude

I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage

A midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off
You too girl if ya fuck with me
I'm gettin' head in the lane doin' sixty
About to crash like Teddy Pendergrass
Mama said a hard head make a tender ass
To all the dogs that bark a lot
Who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
We'll be creepin' in the parking lot
Motherfuckers don't know if I can park or not
Cause I circle like vultures, La Costa Nostra
Bumpin' all the baddest bitches like I'm 'posed to
What's yo name, what's yo number and ya culture
You need nuts in yo face like a poster

If you on the streets nigga then shit bang
If you on the block nigga then shit bang

If ya in a Range Rov then shit bang
If you in that six hundred then shit bang
If you on that Steel Horse then shit bang

And motherfuckers want to ask why I'm cocky now

I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches

So take a hit of that and remember that
Where my motherfuckin' niggas and my bitches at
In the late night hour hit the front to back
Check the motherfuckin' rims on the Cadillac
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight
And if the head right, nigga there every night

And lookin' for ass (In the late night hour)
This is for my people that's countin' they riches

This might be a nigga last record
But respect it cause I could do it all night playa
I'm all fight playa, you all spite playa
It's all right playa, a nigga might care
But to catch me you gotta do a light year

Baby go ahead please do the damn thang
We gonna get chu' high nigga
Our rhymes will get chu' by nigga
Tell me if I qualify nigga
To bail in like SuperFly
I want to get that, cop that, buy that, drive that
You want it too but don't know where to start at
Fuckin' with me, nigga better bring his hard hat

Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you run not true
And you never had plans to stay
Or is it cause you had a girl
On the other side of town
Made plans to be with you

Kiss and enjoy the fame and your title as my mistress, misses

And when my dad called, you said I was yours
And when I was ready, you heart had open doors
So I gave up the biggest smile
For your voice ?It sound?

Don't make Push' Russian Roulette ya

White was the treasure, comfort was the steel
I pedal to the corner like a child on a big wheel
Flow more sicker, so much shake in the street
They measure my weight in Richter
Make no mistake, I rhyme for the public
But still I push weight that make the ghetto's quake

Delta '88 on rims man, wit mirror tint 
And four of my most militant men whose trying to stay sucka free
That's why they hang around me, cause I ain't print
Left em for diamonds and pearls, I'm not no bitch
I choose a mack before that attached 100 shot clip
I scare the shit outta bank tellers so I can become rich
That's how I make my living, I give em encouragement, ""you're doing great!""
Keep chillin while I'm flashing the glock in their face
I show em I can be appreciative, I tell em thanks for giving I'm sinning!

That leaves would grow on trees
And blow with the breeze
And come back next Spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that form new skies
So who's to know
I suppose that you could

So stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel the BAPE
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Hey)

Up, up and away
I be the wind that blows yourself
The pixie dust of Tinkerbell
Up, up and away (P, I think we got one baby)
I be the wind beneath your wings (Pusha, let's go)
Vivid colors in your dreams oh 

Baby, let's pour it up
Lift them Gallardo doors up
Paris for them Louis as soon as the tour's up
The million dollar frames is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when I heard about the lame
And no, I ain't here to try to rewrite your past
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed
When considering love, you take the good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it, I want perfect
That was half the reason I bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it
My new angel surface
She ain't have to rehearse it
My baby's real
That's why I put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her, not yet

So stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours

Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began
Before it here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand

There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go
Will I ever know?

Heaven only knows

So let's make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat, and we can start to dance

Sometimes when we talking words
Drowned on by the sound
Let's get back to touch, and we'll get back on solid ground

Let's hold hands
Like a young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love
Like back way in the day?
We can lose control
Baby, don't say no

Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

So will you come back to me?

So will you come back to me?

Dear Fab
I wrote this letter in confidence you will read it
I succeeded getting my college education completed
Smart girl, not conceited, but used to being treated any way
But anyway, your advice is needed
I'm twenty-two years old with a beautiful daughter
By a dead beat who wouldn't give a quarter to support her
My money was gettin' low, and my patience was getting shorter
Heard about his new girlfriend and all the shit he bought her
So I caught, fought her, heard she had restraining orders
I still grabbed her pony tail and held her under water
So right now I'm sorta locked up for manslaughter
Missing every minute I can't spend with my daughter

[Chorus]

Lo-so
I know you hold profession as a lyricist
But you probably never had depression as severe as this
Your music - it's like a session with a therapist
I asked the Lord to send me any blessin' if he's hearin' this
I'm stressin' somethin' serious, pressin' on delirious
A smart man always asks questions if he's curious
I believe in God, but I don't understand his plan
Why send a Spanish man way up to Afghanistan?
Hand this man a rifle, suit me up in camouflage
I salute the hand of Sarge; he is not a man in charge
I'm fightin' this war, don't know who I'm fightin' it for
Might be goin' AWOL any day, y'all

[Chorus]

Dear Fabolous
I'm such a fan, I don't have much demands
But I'm really hopin' that you will keep in touch with fans
'Cause see, I know you're probably busy kickin' 
With one of them pretty girls from on television shaking it
My vision ain't mistaken, I can see you wasn't faking
So I hope that you can help me with some good decision making
I've been thinkin' lot, so much I haven't slept in days
My mother and father about to go they separate ways
I'm a teen in the cross of a painful divorce
I love my mom, and she thinks I'm an angel, of course
I love my dad, too; I feel tangled and lost
Who's side should I be on?
Your friend, Deon

[Chorus]

Yeah, this song is dedicated to anyone who find they self in a place where they need some advice
You may not always find that person in the physical form, but there's someone you can trust in
Who listens when everybody's ears are shut, who sees when everybody's eyes are closed
Who speaks when everybody's voice is silent
Put your faith in god; the man will take you from there

Am I, am I dreaming or am I sleep walking
Got my arms out stretched so I don't bump into her
Silly me now I'm so into her fashion
To her style her dress
And I'm looking in the mirror like do I look fresh? do I?
Do I look fresh enough to get her,
If I see her one I'm then I wont forget her

'Cause I, I took a picture mentally when I pulled up in the black on black bentley
I really feel like she was meant for me
If she wasn't then I know she was sent for me
Cos she, she's the only one that made me chase
Got me singing love songs like baby face
And I tried to one night her but she made me wait, she made me wait, hah!

And so I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like (something I like, oh she yeah)

I laugh, no surprise that they want my chick

British dudes idolize me they copy him
Hes just to witty, game is too gritty,
Look at his track record man, there's too many
Tens, that's too many to count
I spin, that's a any amount
No matter to sum homey got the cash to cover it
And I when wanna see she be fast to mother it
Yeah, just so she can take my ends
Would I let her to it hmm, well that depends
Can she raise a young king? my blood is royal
And if she can man it aint a thing to spoil her

So they wanna take my gifts

Running round town fakers, zirconian cubic

Throughout history they throwing shots at the greats
But I shoot back, the Lord ain't designed me for hate

With the whole World watching me, turn the other cheek?
Never, so there's one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happens to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then, them near misses was God's kisses
True Hollywood story, ghetto tie bridges
Different strokes that niggas broke the [?] reach
You only read about the cars that I paddle shift
You only dream about the [?] that I dabble with

White stones, black steel cold chrome
This city's my doormat, them home sweet home

Always seen
Off the Queens magazines, pissy hallway scenes
Paying crowds, hunger screams, pressure crumbles teams
Fuck being humble in the jungle where they fumble dreams
Drugs for the living, Henny [?] for the body
Crosses for the power, ghetto for the smiley
Pitbull, I bit my way out the cage, what's happening
Competition got me on the Rampage, Jackson
Part of my reaction to they corny ass raps
Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped
Back for more me, rat tat, kiss the ring, beat respect out them
Bloody heads, turn Timbalands to red bottoms
Fifty bottles just a start now that's how they do it
Carbon fiber through the Spyder playin' rider music
Ain't no question of my resume, I gotta prove it

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the seventies, I cater that
You know what fame is? Sitting with the woman
Of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is? Flushing two bricks
And tryna have a nigga strain it out the drainage

[Chorus]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like you Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Grew up watching momma car repoe'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velor, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real niggas sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show 'em all love, the bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

[Chorus]

Testarossa top models, G fours
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambiance
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilate's on
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in

[Chorus]",I Still Wanna Rock,2011
Pusha T,"I can't be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow so that my core follows
We don't mourn for the dead, nigga we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with Similac powder in a baby bottle
Yughck, the formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother, nigga I'll be damned
Gator at my momma's house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler's paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down forty but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye at it, kept a poker face
Cause the batter I added had the coca base
When you get to heaven's door they won't hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker's face
There's no feeling like your bitch chinchillin' right
You in Italian leather and you four wheeling right
You know you're up when you can count a quarter million right
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I'm a wizard at it, nigga here's the magic
Make a small town feel I threw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bare witnesses I unveil this instant classic

Yes, my God, my God, my God
Yes, my God, my God, yes!

Yughck the Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here, so I'll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say the feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
They say I'm heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The o twelve a year early, I'm a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at thirty and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They'll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I'm here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
Yughck, it's the new god flow, ain't it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted

Yes, my God, my God, my God
Yes, my God, my God, yes!",My God,2011
Pusha T,"I'm only in the company of Kings
I made a power move and it's everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of twenty thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F B I R S D E A
One letter short but still motherfuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try and crack the code
Combination lock to the kilos that I hold
Leopard print Louboutin's, prowlin' the concrete
Roller balls come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of them top floors
Thirty five large took it right out the top draw
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw

[Chorus]
It's like rain, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing but we is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear, hocus pocus
Ring, ring the nigga wanna sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring the nigga wanna sing
Unless he is an insomniac and dying to dream

You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to them o's
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Look I'm all grown up and I dun blown up
Nigga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice the Ruger
You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I'm filthy
Drop Phantom is milky
White on white, twenty four inch blades I'm skatin'
Red eye smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan 
Niggas surprised, fifty back on fire
Fifty back running round this bitch strapped
Hit man for hire

[Chorus]

I sit with the liars, duct tape and tires
Been lost their soul
They just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shit load of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep sea dive for the fish scale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sailed
Take a record head back if that shit fail
Drop weight like an anchor than you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine double scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitches double team when I have my sleep overs
Yeah, Re-Up gang with the G-Unit
This is Taylor made drug dealer fiend music
Test it on ya tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

[Chorus]",Raid,2011
Pusha T,"I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's nine one one you're on your twenty fifth hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't go by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede ya, yeah
Upgrade 'em, upstage 'em
Change the whole body shape and just update 'em, pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous

Yeah, fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote

Come back home straight to the money getters
About fourteen thousand dollars worth in twenties

Still Eddy Caning see the fiends sunken jaws
Pusha ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
Known dope dealer that escaped without a scar
Yes, I'm Buddy Lee so lucky me, see I'm home
Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home
So as I embark, this where the begin start
I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp
My life's a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse's big bed needs a crane for it
I'm fuckin' on it, exotic bitch out the rainforest
So many bitches its a blur, I take the blame for it
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I lay ? camp is vilify
As I up lift this arch for them ceiling high
I can't identify with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots going off that'll awake the dead

[Chorus]
Better know who you is
When you looking in the mirror
'Cause everything that glitters
It ain't gold
I'm getting low, from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happening
Ridin' with my niggas
'Cause everything that glitters, that ain't gold
I'm gettin low, hold me from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted one kept owing
For every bitch I showed the way it's one that kept hoe'in
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and the tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lions
The news you read can be you, ghetto law abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies you and your soul can't see it clearer

[Chorus]

I just can't leave it alone
I just can't leave it alone
They handing out football numbers after tapping your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome
Took a brick then I turned it to stone
Five into ten the return of the clones
Then took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned em to Boeing's
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Lost a lot of niggas, some in club fed
Few still reminiscing in they CL,
Sellin' Pete rock cruisin' in they V twelve

To you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears
Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope
I inspire all the rappers that you might quote
Lookin' down on you niggas like white folk
You're entitled to believe all your high hopes
When you can fool anybody with the right hoax
Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em
With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em

Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it
Hit the jackpot, bullseye, dart through it
Music, I talk through it, it's an art to it
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
As I burn through this money, no thought to it
Eighty cents could save a child, but I ain't up to it

Here to raise the bar, chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In the two door, no rims on the car
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
See what I saw, the best getting better
Look, but can't touch, I'm a muthafuckin' leper

Looking at a guy out here hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilled liquor 
In bars form one side of this world to the other
Than you made
You talkin' to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing
Kiss stealing, woo, wheeling dealing, limousine riding
Jet flying son of a gun
And I'm having a  hard time holding these alligators down

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mention
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I'm what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin, that's pop warner
Menage a trois in the bath house

You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I'm Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it

Sell that pussy to me, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can't deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of

Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I'm still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling under dressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlas applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometres all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by Peta

More pythons, more lizards

Hit it once trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble

And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?

Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry

You hit my cell on Friday, come pick you up outta your place
You tell me I look beautiful, baby that's so unusual
But then we get to the party, you act like you don't even know me
You laughin' it up, you takin' shots, so drunk you forgot about the girl you brought

From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo

Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain?

Pusha T,"Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard
That rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burns us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic
Now you celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses, Push'

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always fuck it
35 years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is did you enjoy the dance with him
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby now he’s transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I’m Jordan vs Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres, Push!

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine

And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres",40 Acres,2013
Pusha T,"I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind, you mothafuckas sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descendant from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on",Hold On,2013
Pusha T,"This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if it hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along
Call me ""daddy"" from a complex
Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking spanish like Don Omar, but

I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga, with the sly talk
Miss me, with all the pie talk
When them lights on you, and them letters big
You point us out, just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress, 'cause

I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks

Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best d-boy all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova, but

I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks",King Push,2013

Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging
I ain't tryna guide you, hand on bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
30 dollar new catsuits is not cute
And 50 comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

Boy, you got that 6 in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely

With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dolla' thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see through V1 V2

Christians or Chloe, damn them C's too

Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother’s CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It’s only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I’m from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all cause the money don’t last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin' “honey don’t ask”

Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down till they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)

Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murder, federal escaping (damn)
Uncle got power, now I see him in another 10
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this powerless masterpiece to the hour

Pusha T,"20 plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby face monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm and hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago
If he dies he dies, like Doughboy to Tre
If he rides he rides, Throwing punches in the room
If he cries he cries, we don't drink away the pain
When a nigga die we add a link to the chain
Inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who's gone fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds til you dying, dead, yah!

You better change what comes out your speaker

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind, I still smell crime
My little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten
Back when nine ounces have got you ten
And nine times out of ten niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy dumped a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat land on his gold
I said ""daddy, one day I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said ""son, how come you think you be my connect?""
Said ""pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect""
He said ""well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga
Please reap what you sowed, nigga

Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, ""it ain't adding up""
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question ""Were you man enough?""
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me; can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
""They sayin' Tarian been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home""
""Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome""
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying

Sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing
Once he told me that

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me; can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!",S.N.I.T.C.H.,2013
Pusha T,"Yeah, I just ordered one my nigga

I’m still a snow mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the ass crack
I’m still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to em, I ain’t talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale, I ain’t a Libra either
I’m just a name and number with the means to reach ya
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, him chief of
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers you been leeching
Been baller, been Jacob, been dealer
Been realer, pound sign, been trilla
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas you zoolander, Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
35 hundred, just point and give them a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way

Between renter and a homeowner
Hip Hop, we can cover any rolling stoner
Louboutins I heist nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers cause they in their moment
Might of crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the bible don't burn like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scene that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
Oh, suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go

They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way

Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top 5, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I un-master
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it fall like Sebastian
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, nigga brick, break down, break dance
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go

Even if it's left overs I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite

It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missing an S, nigga
Your plane's missing a chef
The common theme see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-league, I'm like these clothes
'88 Jordan, leaping from the free throw

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

(Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
Twenty-five bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed twenty-five more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch live and say I bought her Michael Kors?
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here
Raised round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo moulin rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins
Yughck! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could, to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPY's
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Woo!)
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Woo!)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Woo!)
Who are you to be compared with? (Woo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Caught cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
Yughck! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade nigga!

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could, to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let-let-let-let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already livin'
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these mothafuckas hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload
Yughck! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade nigga!

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life

Um, it’s so throwed (so throwed)
So throwed (so throwed) so throwed (so throwed)

It’s the mentality of hate

Coming from the street life we know, exciting
Know we like to go to school for education
But the street life we know don’t write no notes
It’s like parole with the time we’re facing

Ooh ain’t nobody gon' help
Ooh tryin' survive and sell
Ooh these a ?
The point of the game as money

The newspaper calls it streetlife
The recession in real life
Tryna get where the breeze is nice
So I can breathe

Everybody round me tryna get to the money
Including me

Ooh, my best friend named Abby
We up and live like, waiter XO
Ooh, and she be rollin' that fatty
And puffin as long as it takes

Yet ‘cause life is so cold (so cold)
So cold (so cold) and it's throwed
But the, truth and some man ain't ready
But what she got the next day

Coming from the street life we know, exciting no

Ceiling full of commas
Saving your receipts because she never keep a promise
This presidential Rollie don’t make me Obama
So don’t judge me by my jewelry please your honor
The persona of this dope dealin' summertime
Top dropper wintertime, fool ain’t fox rocker
Wooh! What it be like?
It’s just king pushin Kelly roll,
Giving you the street life, brap!

Coming from the street life we know, exciting no
We like to go to school for education
But the street life we know don’t write no notes

Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like Manute Bol

For every one I cook, I make two clones
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamera
Two in the Four like the Porsche Panamera

Who to trust? Who to love?
Who to run from? Who to hug?
Set fire to a government of thugs
Respect only comes from the money or your blood

We're out of sight, shadows of light
They're closing in and I know where we're goin'
But I don't know who I'll be

In my eyes, in my ears, bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
Can we make it out right now
It's a full meltdown

I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can’t hear it over gun play 
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof
So we still lose

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

I don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

It’s more and more and more than Baltimore
From shore to shore, oh lord
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

Oh how the day can be so long

If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all

Gonna make it big
Take a seat
Enjoy the show

Push on me

You gotta play it loud
You gotta shout it
If you wanna get in

Feeling something
It's real and breathing
I feel like I don't belong

I know it might be wrong

Don't count me out!

Keep getting ready
I made you breakfast for the last time
It's time to pack up
Put on your make-up
You're wearing my t-shirt for the last time
I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry

You lay in bed next to him at night
Convince yourself that what you did was right
Instead of him, you'll want me back
You can't move on
I know you'll wind up missing me

So drink your coffee
I made you breakfast
You're wearing my t-shirt for the last time
A revelation, we'll never make it
I'm staring at you for the last time
I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry

You lay in bed next to him at night
Convince yourself that what you did was right
Instead of him, you'll want me back
You can't move on
I know you'll wind up missing me
Missing me
Missing me
You'll wind up missing me
Missing me
Missing me
You'll wind up missing me

You know you'll wind up messed up
Getting stuck in a rut
Out of luck with no life
You will be sorry

You lay in bed next to him at night
Convince yourself that what you did was right
Instead of him, you'll want me back
You can't move on
I know you're going to be sorry
You'll wind up missing me
You'll be sorry

Pushover,"Why do you build a fence around
The things you hid from me

Why do it now
Did you hear me say
I can't make up my mind
I'll have to start another day, yeah
Like you had it anyway

You started out just watching out
You knew it, you did it again and again
Why can't you believe I'm not the one you think I am
I said it, you knew it, you did the best to ignore the best of me
And all the things you hear
Behind my back they aren't true
Why do you even try",Pitiful,1998
Pushover,"All that I had
All gets mixed up in my head
Alone every night
I've been locked up by myself
Far away from you 

All rested while my shoes are off to dream
I feel tested while I walk along the seam
Don't be frightened when I yell at you softly
Startled when I hear my life's insanity

Pictures of you
Still right beside my bed
Cannot wonder why
I don't have permission to
Taken my mind, too
All the things can go wrong
When you don't get very far
Cause I don't like you
When you're feeling down on yourself",Softly,1998

What it is about you that I love
I can't be without you know
I can't hold on

If everything works out and you've
Thought about
The things that you said
I won't
Be here too long because you're making me sick

We could be

let me back inside

Well, it's all my fault",Her,2000
Pushover,"Have you ever been awake all night
And not a thing could take it all away
I'm beginning to admit to it
when someone else's loss isn't for me
For everyone in their own world
Who's stopping you, so find away
I want to get where we're going
Just count out to yourself, make sure there's no one else
I'll be the last one to know
Say, I'm gonna find my own way back to earth
Say I can't forget what I had
There's something that I wanted to know
Remember I won't let it go
Something like insanity, that's me
I give it anyway that is my life
Well I know I can't predict the time
Don't take me with you when you can't decide

You decide to just disappear
Why
See the thing that you would do, do the things that have been done to you

Nothing changes, you're still having fun
Soon enough the fun will end
Now you went and lost all your friends
I hope it all was worth all you have lost

And I know I cannot help
But I'm here when you get back in line
I won't lose my faith in you

Oh! They really pack 'em in

To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
The temple band took five
The crowd caught a wiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the shareef
Had cleared the square
As soon as the shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was outa their hair

Pussycat,"Where you can hear a country song song from far
And someone plays the honky-tonk guitar
Where all the lights will go out one by one
The people join the sun
And the wind takes it away

Where the Mississippi falls down to the sea
And lovers found the place thhhey'd like to be
How many times before the song was ending
Love and understanding
Everywhere around

Mississippi, I'll remember you
Whenever I should go away
I'll be longing for the day
That I will be returning again
Mississippi, you'll be on my mind
Everytime I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time

Now the country song for ever lost its soul
When the guitar player turned to rock & roll
And everytime when the summernights are falling
I will always be calling dreams of yesterday",Mississippi,1996

Pussycat,"I love to be with you but now I'm leaving
I really did enjoy this single evening
Moments here with you I will remember
O Rainy day that come
Summer love has left my heart and saint it
Its hard to go away before it ended
Those Kisses on a mountain 
A tree,car and a fountain

The time has come that we must say goodbye
If you ever come to Amsterdam,I'll be waiting there for you
And I 'll show you were young lovers go on a sunny afternoon
Where the summer nights in Amsterdam covered flowers at your side
I'll be yours the day we'll meet again in Amsterdam

I call you every day cause when I hear you
I am dreaming every moment I'll be near you
I found the morning clover and like to send it over 
Maybe there's a time we meet one day
If you ever come to Amsterdam,I'll be waiting there for you
And I 'll show you were young lovers go on a sunny afternoon
Where the summer nights in Amsterdam covered flowers at your side
I'll be yours the day we'll meet again in Amsterdam
