And soothe my ears
You heal my wounds

Come on I need to show it

You're now my only friend
I'm too heavy, I'm the burden

Sitting and picking on myself

The difference
This is hot blood
And a difference
What a difference
A little difference would make

Poverty's profitable

See it slip and slide

It's not that easy
When you want it easy

A little difference would make

Don't fall asleep

Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul (Brothers and sisters) 
Listen if you're missing y'all 
Swinging while I'm singing
Giving whatcha getting
Knowing what I know 
While the Black bands sweating
And the rhythm rhymes rolling
Got to give us what we want

What counts is that the rhymes 
Designed to fill your mind 
Now that you've realized the prides arrived 
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough 
From the heart 
It's a start, a work of art 
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange 
People, people we are the same 
No we're not the same 
'Cause we don't know the game 
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless 
You say what is this? 
My beloved lets get down to business 
Mental self defensive fitness 
Bum rush the show 
You gotta go for what you know 
Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be

Purer than gold

Do you know what you will find
Open your mind

Even the words they fail me
Oh look what it's doing to me
I never say what I want to say
It's only a word believe me
If only the world could see me
I promise I'd send the word away

If you look with your eyes
Do you know what you will find
Open your mind

The melody always finds me
Whenever the thought reminds me
Breaking a chain inside my head
The melody chord unwinds me
The rhythm of life unties me
Brushing the hands of time away

If you look in your mind
Do you know what you will find
Open your mind
Open your mind
Open your mind",Timeless Melody,1990

For you to be my freedom, nothing that I can bring
You give me everything, you give to me this freedom

I walked like the rest, did everything they did
But I never felt like I fitted
The puzzle I fit is somewhere else instead

You taught me the reason and how I should deal
With what I was keeping underneath it all
It's life that I'm living ever since we met",Freedom,2002
The Lads,"You take me to an island
Far from all my cares
Not really a place more
In my heart somewhere

When I look into Your eyes

I feel peace around me
Soft rain upon dry waste
A river of life flows
Through my emptiness

When I look into Your eyes

You take me away into Your grace
Deep in the light and life I'm lead
You give me peace, give me rest

To have You with me is all that I need
The rush of Your flooding spins me 'round
Your hope will lift me off the ground",Island,2002
The Lads,"There's a sound that's goin' ?round
Something I found it?s hit the town
(Marvel music sound)

This is it, I can't contain
Can't remain unchanged the same
(Marvel music sound)

Drilled a channel through my ear
Ripped a hole in the veneer
The sound pounding it is changing me
Can anybody hear?

Supersonic high is taking me away
Signal sensitize to another place

It?s a sound that's life to pain
To dryness rain brings dancin'
(Marvel music sound)

Like burning fire within my veins
And suddenly I breathe again
(Marvel music sound)

Something is happening to me
Something is happening to me
The sound surrounding with salvation songs
Expose my deepest need

Ahh, still hit MC's like (""hoo-yu-ken"" *Street Fighter sound, from Afro
Puffs*) 

Uh, I begin like this; with the wicked ass flow 
Somethin for you wack MC's to think about why'know (you what?) 
You better be on point (they what?), ya better be on deck 
You better be strapped and buckled down cause I'ma wreck 
*tires squeel, car crashes and glass breaks* like vehicles 
I pop suckers like sickle 
I tickle your fancy like Nancy and Wil-son get ill son 
rock it from Farnville, the Tilden Projects (hah) 
Concealed when I wreck 
So hey, step like stairs, or prepare for the levitate (to what?) 
to mount up on that ass like Warren G the Regulator 
I won't hesitate to put a sucker on his back (uh-uh) 
I don't hesitate to take a sucker out like that (uh-uh) 
I close my eyes and dig deep into myself 
Come up with the shit that's hittin harder than belts 
cause I'm spankin, fakin MC's 
off the batboard smack another hit from the back door 

*chorus* 
It's that Sho Shot shit I release 
MC's from the West and the East get a motherfuckin piece 
Cause it, ain't where ya from it's, where's ya gat 
And the lyrical attack is where my ammo is at 

(repeat 2X) 
Now they call me Rage cause I rush and come down like a hammer 
Live rhythm get driven by vocal vehicular grammar 
Untouched, the walls come crumbling down 
You get clutched, in my clutches fifty feet from the ground 
Fatally feminine, poisonous enought to extinct 
cities of war fled the valley, so all of Cali sink 
I come stompin like Snoop, hit the N-why next 
I ain't puffin up that shit between the East and the West 
I use my, hip-hop precision, perfectly put to use it's 
metaphoric phrases, spittin like deuce deuces 
Continuous and strenuous, crafty and shady 
Brothers notice me like Jodeci, now Forever They Lady 
I puts it to ya like this, you can despite me, dislike me 
I makes money like Spike Lee 
You either want to be me or be just like me 
I'm nasty, nice-ty, no sheisty 
Ahh, so cold I'm icy, hah, so throw them dice G 

*chorus* (repeat 2X) 
Now I speak with expertise, and any heffer won't beef (moo) 
I be that A-1 Sauce, on your lips like floss 
I eat suckers as my entree, Rage got da bombay 
I gets total wreck and I ain't, playin wit a full deck 
it's just this, ace in your face, kicks from Earth to outer space 
Gimme space room to breath, roll up my sleeves just to breeze 
Blowin up the spot like infrared dots on your knot 
your knoggin, lyrical murderer a Rockin Robin 
I be dishin out that puddin, all you suckers pussyfootin 
be actin, but I ain't got time for theatrics 
My crews be crushin, shitty MC's 
I be flushin down the commode as I explode cock back and reload 
Right the beat until they say WHOA 
Then they tell me, ""Momma don't hurt me no mo'!"" 
I'm strictly bout them skills on the reala 
Strictly bout this motherfuckin MC cold killa, illa

Serve the lord with gladness
Come before his presence with singin
Know, ye that the lord is one

Forgive me God, for I have forsaken thee
I'm not gonna say that it's the devil that's makin' me
Do what I do, the things that I've done
Just because I'm young, and it's all for fun
I never really thought about the consequences
But ever since Eazy died, I said ""Now Ima listen""
Yay, though I walk through the valleys of death
I open my eyes, they droppin' like flies, my last breath
Might get snatched, taken, broke down I'm shaken
Shaken by that shit that's breakin'
Down your nervous system
So, if you're nervous listen
Kissin' cousins die by the dozens
Because I like good lovin' will I burn in a oven
Fiery furnace
'Cause sometimes the yearn gets
Tempting so I yield into temptation
Intoxication mixed with fornication
Face the nation, face the revelation the ending
Will I be caught up in the rapture 
Or will I be left behind because what I'm caught up in got me captured
Amazin' Grace, could save a wretch like me
But a wretch like me feels that Hell is already my destiny (Why?)
Because I messed with He (Who?),him
He who sends them
The demons
I see em schemin' amongst my dreamin'
They tell me he awaits suddenly I awake
I got a funny feelin' it won't be long before He
takes my soul that was the deal all for mass appeal
Dollar dollar bill, now my fate seems sealed
The nails in the coffin, he's coughin', I'm lookin'
Through my iris
To see if he's got the virus
Paranoia starts to sink in 
Deranged thoughts start to blink in
And out of my mind playin' tricks on me
Sufferin' with suicidal tendencies, since ten plus three
On bended knee I ask what's intended for me cause I can't cope
Some tellin' me I ain't shit, some tellin' me I ain't got no hope
Confessions of a young girl stressin'
Sittin' alone sweatin', burnin' cigarettes into my flesh
Not knowin' where I'm going, Can't understand why I came
I can't stand the rain, so I'm self inflictin' pain 
Gotta get a grip
Gotta hold on a little tighter to the end of this rope, before I slip
Into insanity
Lost within calamity
Forgive me for I know not what I do but what I've done
I confess with my tongue
To you
He who created heaven and earth, but still I'm still confused
I don't know what to do
Is there some way that you 
Could just clear my visions 
Can't see you with false prophets and religions
But I'm driven to find the force that keeps me livin'
But ifn'I might be mistaken
They tell me I'll be held accountable and fried like bacon
But wait, when I didn't ask to come here
Why is this all unclear 
I can't understand, it all seems unfair
They tell me not to question God, but the question is
Will I make it to live another day cause times gettin' hard
So you tell me to believe, have the faith of a mustard seed
Ask and I shall receive 
And you're all I need
Indeed, this may be true 
I'm tryin' to find my link to you
But, for all the things I do, I might not even make it through
Because we're all born in sin, so nine times out of ten
We're all gonna die in sin, same thing all over again
But, I don't want to fry God, I don't even want to die
So many tears I cry, so many years I try
I know I've done wrong I know I sing the same ole song
But truly I seek a righteous way, that'll lead me to be strong
In spirit and mind, body and soul
Deliver me from evil make me whole
God take control
Before it's too late, before you turn me over to a reprobate mind
Before you cast me in a lake of fire with my kind
Of sinners, for I am a sinner, I confess
I pray you forgive me and do bless
My soul to the very end 
This I ask God forgive me

Amen 
A-Men
Amen
A-Men
Amen
A-Men
Amen
A-Men

Hey God, can you hear me?
Can you see me?
I can see heaven there
Let me see, what's wrong with me
Hey God, come take a walk with me
Hey God, come have a talk with me

The Lady of Rage,"From the end to the intro meaning the beginning, so 
I got the microphone one-two one-two here I go again 
Ready, to do damage, but just a little bit, slower 
To let you know Rage is that lyrical flow blower 
I'm smooth and creamy, milky silky steamy 
Eyes get wet and dreamy everytime a brother see me (cause why?) 
Cause they can't understand the gift of tongues 
That left em standin still and dumb 
In the dust, dare I bust, what I must, and I must son 
Continue to crush those that rushed, played dumb, and got done 
Yeah you played the high stakes and got baked 
Tried to be icing and wound up cake, translate 
Meaning I broke em down to the least common denominator 
Not afraid of a sucker cause I drop em like a hot potato 
? later, if you still be or want to be a instigator 
Daz cross the fader (why) cause no one is greater 

I be that chick with the hits and I'm hittin it 
I be that chick with the lyrics and I'm spittin it 
(c'mon now) 
Microphones, I'm definitely rippin it 
So come come, come again, get with da wickedness 

Now it's like bang to the boogie, I'm one tough cookie (betcha what?) 
Betcha bite a clit loaded wit lyrical arsenic 
As I hit wit my spitfire bullets 
Wit licks from my tongue, so watch me pull it (uhhh!) 
Take it to the hilt, I'm thick like quilt (yeah) 
Raw like silk, uh-huh, or creamy like milk, ok now 
Let me break it down to the slab

From the gut, to the cut, move that butt, cause I'm rippin shit up 
Make em fall a victim to my def flow 
Lyrical murderer, that's why I'm on Death Row

Now I'm, hah, rockin ruff and stuff with my Afro Puffs 
Hah, blowin em away like the Big Bad Wolf-a 
Huffin, puffin, blowin, no bluffin

I tell ya, ya pumpin that ass up for failure (why?) 
I nail you to a cross (huh) hang you out to dry

Lyrical muderer, microphone bone crusher
Yeah yeah why'all
Break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah

Now check the mic stalker, will wear you out like Walker
Rock a microphone like I was a native New Yorker
I strike HARD like Ben Frank's lightning rod
Leave you suckers scarred (uh-huh) leave you suckers charred
Now you're burnt to a crisp, so check the vocalist
I get sick with my shit, wicked like sadistics
It'll be a +Black Moon+ when I _Enta Da Stage_
Grab the microphone, turn from Robin to Rage
Then I shoot from the jugular, I get rough and ruggeder
You can't front on this big body Southerner
Your shit'll get smacked back, you're booty like asscrack
Who reigns supreme, baby no need to ask that
I bust on the daily, get down to the roots like Hailey
As I proceed to rock the mic, feel me, I
Gets total wreck and make crews pop, I
Rock from Osaka down to the Boondocks
Pop goes the rhyme on you weasels (uh-huh)
Rock strictly for my peoples, strictly for those Prince Edward evils
As I, blow up like spontaneous combustion, hah
I'll be the +Queen+ of MC's that's +Flushing+, hah
And ain't no maybe's, or might be's, cause if the mic be
Within reaches of my psyche, I just eat it up like Mikey
(I like it) when I'm weeded, so beat it, don't let me get heated
Or you just might get stretched out like Sealy Posturepedic
(Believe it) so it is said, so it is written
Until the day that I'm dead, I'll keep hittin
Always and forever spittin, from my soul for real
Down yellow brick roads I will, uhh
Chase them dreams, make more snap than green beans
Ask Mr. Greenjeans who's the Captain, I'm slappin
Fast-actin like Tinactin, mo' deeper than the ?
So get crackin, you don't want to Clash with this Titan
Whether freestylin or writin, the way I be breakin off mics man
I'm twirlin MC's like I'm Major Wreck
Cause I'm a major threat, once again Rage in effect

I'm rhymin til I'm blue in the face so face, the, facts
Don't look back, or you're gonna be salty
Uhh, ah-hah, you best take flight like Maltese, Falcon
You're scalpin, your hearts palpitatin
Fluttering from the uttering of the vocab when I spake it
When I spit it, wack MC's get omitted
Now did it not occur to you, that I could serve a few
Good men or women, cause I'ma, equal opportunity, HAYYY
You're bound to lose, unless your name is Parker Lewis
Now let's do this, let the games begin (uh-huh)
Got suckers on the sideline mad as a wet hen, so you best
Step with that rambling, you're gambling with fate
I got suckers scrambling like quarterbacks from Grambling State
So, don't eff around Tootsie, you might get Roll-ed up
Sewed up, you best play like crutch and fold up
HOLD UP, watch me flip shit like a gymnast Mary Lou Retton
Best play like Omega Psi Phi and start steppin
Jettin on the first Delta out
Cause I make mics melt in my mouth
Takin em out is all I'm about, now check me OWWWWWWWWT
For hip-hop, I dies off with a vengeance
My vocab blows doors off it's hinges, with every sentence
And since this is the new age, uhh, ah-hah
All lyrical concoctions, by lyrical murderer Rage
Got a vertical hold, on verbal abusin ways
Cervical tubes get spayed, neutered, get slayed, tutored, DONE
Blood shit, on nuff shit, quick, handcuff this
Cause it's definitely Necessary Roughness

The Lady of Rage,"[Verse 1]
On your mark set flows, fluid like that H²O
I'm hittin' wit' the force of a gale wind blow
Windows can't stop the pain, can't stop the rain
On your parade march on cause it's the Rage
The baddest with the phattest lyrical apparatus
Boost my status in cahoots wit' +Gladys
Knight+ is fallin, from mics MC's are crawlin'
Cause they afraid to get down with my lyrical braw-lin'
Skills sho 'nuff, that's the rizzeal (real)
Brothas on my tit fo' the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin', speak it
Didn't think a wisdom body had techniques for freakin'
So go ahead and keep sleepin'
Because nuthin' comes to sleepers but a dream
And I'm your worst nightmare with puffs in my hair, you stare
At the big bo-ty (booty)
Style kinda choppy
Fill you up like Sloppy
Joes, when I flows

[Hook] (Daz)
And you know it goes like that (mhmm)
Who can do it better than this big chick in rap (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Breaks it all down like that (mhmm)
One hard act to follow and a tough nut to crack (oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Repeat 1x]
[Verse 2]
Now if your name was +Midler+ I +Bette+ you couldn't get wit' this riddler
You could cross your heart and still couldn't detain this full figure
It takes more than gridles to hold back my phatness
You got more hurdles to jump so go back practice
You must have forgotten
I could give it to you like God gave his only begotten
Son, you want to run up on this and get chaught up in the twist like Bambu
Not Onyx, but I can definitely +Slam+ you
So +BacDaFucUp+ or set it off if you want it
You can't escape these off the hook flows when I flaunt it
Now who can you run to, ain't nowhere to hide
When I kicks my shit I gets deeper than the Poseidon
Adventure, your dentures get knocked down your throat
Check the murder that I wrote, you couldn't hang with a rope
Oh no, yo' flows unh-unh
It's the lyrical murderer, stranded on the, stranded on the

[Verse 3]
Now I rise to the occasion
The Lady Of Rage, representin' the female persuasion
Invasion of the 50th woman, comin' through
One in few
And If any, there ain't many
That can get wit' me, I'm not a rookie like Penny
Ain't a harder way than mine
You gotta a long ladder to climb
Like Jacob, wake up, your make-up is runnin'
I'm stunnin' MC's, with the breeze that I'm blowin' wit'
You can get wit' the wick and you knowin' it
Here I go, lyrical gangbangin'
Breakin 'em down like diggy-dang diggy-dang-dang
Now who rang, I got the whole shabang
The Lady Of Rage and them Dogg Pound Gang-stas
Wippin' that ass like Charmin tissue
Cause when I grab the mic it'll be a closed issue
Oh shit, I'm still the shit that's all and that's it and...

Break it down",Rough Rugged and Raw,1997
The Lady of Rage,"Hey, hot damn, ho, here I go again
You know who I be, and you know watcha in for
For your information
Me, I be coming harder than ejaculation
Evacuation on the premesis (I'm what?), I'm limitless
Run it to the limit, like Emmitt Smith, I'm listed in the Guinness's
For in the book of Genesis it reads
In the beginning God created Heaven then he created me
So you see
It ain't no way on earth you can see me
That's just how it B.E
You might as well drop that thought, cause it ain't goin down, G
You wishin, I'll leave you curled up in the fetal position
Impossible mission you think you gettin with Rage, well, then listen
You're thinkin the unthinkable
Rage is the unsinkable
Who can do it better
I gotta art for linkin letters
A diva run it like Gail Devers
Style so sick you think I got swamp fever
To all non-believers
Y'all ain't believin I rocks hard when I'm stoned like Steven
The way I kill it I leave you in a process of grieven
Leave you barely breathin
Kicks it so hard I knock out your teeth and leave you teethin
Take aim and shoot, knock you out your boots
I be the beginning of a New Testament like Matthew, Mark, and Luke
I turn the motha out in Levi Strauss
No doubt, make suckas do an about
Face, cut to the chase
They told me haste makes waste
And I'll waste you if you're hasty
Lyrically, it don't take much to make me
Fly off the handle
Go off like Roman candles
Scandalous not
Band you like wristwratch
Watch me clock a end, clock a grip
Watch me grip that microphone and cold rock that bitch
To your socks get hit
From the esophogus my vocal range will expand
And raise up and smack that ass like back hands
I got that shit that leave your whole section deaded
And, if you got no common sense you won't be ressurected
Fed-Ex it, my successes didn't make it over night
But over mics for you it could be over in just one night
Cause the R hits like Thundarr the Barbarian
Neva in your life could you ever scar the Aquarian
Water Bearer
Great Granddaughter of Clara
Bring the terror to your dome
As you get nearer to my throne
Them bones get crushed to dust
Cause when it comes down to struttin my stuff
It's necessary
I get rough
Cause I'm a lyrical genius no other could swing this
Better than I (Why?) cause I'm one of the meanest
Not givin a damn statin to all who I am
No need to cram, cause now you fully understand
That Robin is rockin, causin hippers to hoppin
Try to stop what I'm droppin, and a box you'll be popped in
Think twice, save your life, give me the mic
I say it again, yo, it won't be nice
You think I'm huffin and puffin, think I'm blowin and bluffin
You hens can't begin to contend with Robin
Voice smooth, lyrics lovely
The hippest hip-hopper, got brothers tuggin to hug me
Ah, dig",Some Shit,1997
The Lady of Rage,"Ahh.. now I be drillin MC's

The only girl to knock you out the frame
Call me Mrs. Butter-cause-I'm-worth it, I work shit
overtime, definitely blow your mind
when the instruments become mental (I what?)

when I come stompin on the ground
My territory, I mark it
like dogs pissin on trees, umm, don't piss me off because

Flow from the larynx
Take a puff and blow MC's like clarinets
I ride beats like a Yama'

Suckers get dumped in my dungeon
MC's hard as tress, but I'ma play Paul Bunyan
Chop chop, like an axe, my vocals stickin like thumbtacks
Ha hah hah, don't try to mock me cause my voice is on wax
It's, fireproof and that's the God's honest truth
Hard as a brick (*UTFO sample*) ""Bite it!"" and it'll break your tooth
or teeth chief, and that's the end of the beef, chew it
Cause I don't see a damn thing that you can do with it
Sheeyit, Super Supreme
When it's time to let off steam, I'm a microphone fiend
'phone fiend, Super Supreme hah, Afro Queen
Ahh.. definitely rough..

Now I gets sick like chlamydia from here to Syria
Drip burnin lyrics like venereal diseases
Strategic procedures (done at the what) done at the leisure

Break it down",Rough Rugged & Raw,1997
The Lady of Rage,"That makes me know that, we we we we're doin
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus, and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
with the times, and everything y'know
And and so.. y'know
The rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated
but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

""The real... hip-hop""
""MCing, and DJing.. from your own mind, ya know?""
""I, I guess right now we should start the show""

Who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez...

""You know my steez"" 
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""To the beat y'all""

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
(""You know my steez"" --> Method Man) 
You know my steez...

""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""The mic...""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""The mic...""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez"" 
""The mic...""

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's, pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond... you know my steez

I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murdering niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit
Niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossing
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good

I'm stacking and macking and packing a ten so
When you're slipping, I slip the clip in
But ain't no set tripping
'Cause it's Death Row, rolling like the mafia
Think about whooping some ass, but what the fuck stopping ya
Ain't nothing but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumping slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite

And now I'm serving a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Laying lain with the shame, who's to blame

On when I'm coming from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W taking, no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped

And creeping through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Busting raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shooting at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothing but a black thing bay-bee
No I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfucking homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop

Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.

Well, the first time that I saw you, you looked so doggone sweet
When you walked down the street, I said 'There goes my meat.'
[Needless to say, Kay Starr's version didn't have this line.]

Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.

With my heartache in my hands
It must be nice to be above it all
Sometimes I wish I was above it all.
These emotions that 
I'm wearing on my sleeve
Are sewn too tightly to fall off

They've got skin as thick as thieves
Sometimes i wish I was above it all

Just chasing my tail
Do I listen to the voice 
Telling my to stay
Or listen to the voice 
That's screaming out...

Just go with your heart
Go with the flow

A few good men
That'll buy me flowers

On a dead end street 
In a dead end job

More easier for you

Would've been to tell you more than
Not a thing before she
Just backed out on the deal.

She could've hung around
To wind the hold thing down
Maybe even helped you through it
Held your hand until you knew
It was over for real, but

She had to get gone

Today you're just her old life

You might think that I've been drinking
Stumbling, laughing crazy as a fool.

There's a sweet memory
Of an old front porch swing
And daddy singing to me
I can still feel the touch of
His callused hands
In my eyes he was
The one perfect man.
The first top three men
I gave my heart to
Jesus, daddy and you.
Come Sunday morning
I knew where I'd be
Between momma and daddy
Pew number three
Where I put my life in
To them scarred hands
The day that I fell for
One more perfect man.
The men I have loved
Have been mighty few
Jesus, daddy and you.
There are three kinds of love
That everyone needs
I knew that something 
Was missing for me.
Then you came along and 
Completed my life
I saw Jesus and daddy and your loving eyes
I looked up when you put
That ring on my hand
And I thank my God
For one more perfect man.

Who's love has been true

The Last Dance,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking

The Last Dance,"Last night I thought I saw you staring
Staring at the sky
Last night I thought I saw you wishing for your dreams to die
Last night I thought I heard you crying
Crying all your tears
Last night I thought I saw your shadow as you disappeared

Do you believe in angels
Do you believe in blood and wine
Do you believe in broken hearts
Or is this something you've never heard of
Do you believe it's a better world
Do you believe that no one cries
Do you believe in bitter tears
Or is this something you've never wanted to believe in

Last night I thought I saw you staring
Staring at the sky
Last night I thought I saw you wishing for your dreams to die
Last night I thought I heard you screaming
Screaming all your tears
Last night I thought I saw your shadow as you disappeared

Do you believe in angels
Do you believe in god-like eyes
Do you believe in thornless roses
Or is this something you've never heard of
Do you believe in heaven
Do you believe you'll never die
Do you believe that I've never deceived you
Or is this something you've always wanted to believe in

Be careful what you're wishing for upon your falling star
I just might be the angel that you're looking for",Do You Believe in Angels,1996
The Last Dance,"We pretend to be afraid
Underneath our twilight
Missing everything we were
Missing something just like

In the passing of our night
Softly reaching out for
A breath of silence within our pride
Pretending just like

Taken in
Taken far away to be as we once were
To be as we once believed in

Not in words
Not in fairytales
Not in silence or in front of you
With nightmares like these

This bitter silence
Be still my nightmare
The moment passes by

To look away
To be like everyone
Who feel and thinks they see
To want to fall or be in sympathy

This bitter silence taints my world
Becomes my nightmares
And moments passing by

Not in words
Not in fairytales
Not in silence or in front of you
With nightmares like these

Within my heart
In this moment I could scream
From your whisper Im bleeding
Into a dream
To live for another day

When it seems like we can't fall
When it feels like we could live or die

It's your heart in this moment
Breathing into what I dream
In my heart it is this feeling
In my nightmares while I scream

It's your heart in this moment
Haunting into where I dream

And in my heart it feels like nothing
Broken slowly piece by piece",Nightmares,2003
The Last Dance,"In slow motion all seems right, she said
As she closed her eyes
Disappearing to you and pretend

She could be the star
Falling between worlds
Through her painted sky
In her silence
Behind the shadow no one sees
Behind the shadow
Lost and finding reasons she romaticizes

With the glass she brings the sky, her light
She hides behind, her smile, never a word
Until her heart is breaking still

She could be the star
Fallin' between worlds
Through her painted sky
Silently she

More than just a whisper in whom
Suddenly a tear from nowhere
Quietly she's in slow motion
Wishing silently as time stands still

She could be my perfect star
Falling in my perfect world
Unaware of the perfect sky
Silently she",Silently She,2003

The Last Emperor,"[Verse 1]
I stare into the face of death
and the fear that's so obvious
wordplay is the way that I conquer it
shivalry's not dead if the living honor it
i send a message to men on all continents
and this is my imperial decree
to who so ever steals material from me
the emcee who comes with new abilities
and the same man in king david luther's philistines
'cause when it comes to emcees they leave you
no choice but to destroy the embodiment of evil
deadly force against the source of upheavel, that seems to
oppress and bring death to my people
the way to defy this death
is to keep kicking rhymes until there's no rhymes left
the emperor takes the form of the giant dredd
with the body of a man, and a lion's head
and this dence urban jungle of great disorder
cd players, turntables and tape recorders
become the tools that I use to erase the borders
between me and the secret and ancient order
that I swore to protect and uphold
if you're looking for the bloodiest battle, you've struck gold
from young to old, ripe and then rotten
i came to drop bombs like osama bin laden
using poisonious chemicles to shower fools
ravenous animals devour fools
i build a giant robot to overpower crews
using pens and pencils like power tools
a fifty-foot metal man, named lyricore
will stand up to the bully and hit him in the jaw
'cause when I step in the door
it takes a minute for the emperor, senator, madator, minitor
kicking bitterness to show it ain't sweet
whether it's a dark cave, or the middle of the street
'cause the only thing happening the next time we meet
is the thrill of my victory and agony of your defeat (echoes)",Monolith,
The Last Emperor,"Yo, everybody lookin' at me like I'm 'bout to drop
Some real fucked up, dissin' black people shit
Just gone give it here, check it out

Man, it's some cold-hearted shit you doin' dawg
I guess tha-that's the way it is
Yea, folks don't write about this shit
Why you got to focus on negativity?
You forgot that didn't cha, yea, but I see it good now

Yo, I remember when the summer was hot, I'm huggin' my block
The soldier, tryin' to get over with this hustle I got
Lookin' out for the cops, on my way to the top
Ain't no reason to even question if I'm rugged or not

I saw the neighborhood stars drivin' our favorite cars
See they out gettin' theirs, so now we tryin' to get ours
Through a neighborhood tours, goin' through neighborhood wars
Gettin' bigger doors, mixin' this neighborhood sport

We had a powerful team, doin' powerful things
The American dream, I'm about gettin' cream
It ain't just for me, it's for my whole family
This is for all of y'all, I call it the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Amidst the dangerous days, and the dangerous nights
The lost wages and the salary heights
I stayed out of harms way, helped my family to fight
When I slipped into darkness, they brought me back to the light

Pray to the Lord above for added insight
A man confronted with these challenges in his life
To the ladies I might, be the compassionate type
Come see if it's real and feel what my action is like

Right, the man of your dreams, I'm handlin' fiends
Fabulous things, more than mansions and rings
A palace built for a king, is how rich'll be
You tryin' to win, get a piece of this victory

And don't ask about my past, that's history
Don't be afraid of the hustle girl, just get with me
You gotta love supreme, but as good as it seems
I'm in love with the cream, this is the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Can you stay alive in this strugglin' thing?
Stay alive in this hustlin' thing?
The hustle's only as good, as what the customers bring
Some are no longer with us, others locked up in the bing

See I found a knew trade that I hustle with
It's called hip-hop and I got a love for it
Far from easy believe me y'all, I must admit
'cause y'all customers'll never get enough of this

And now you can depend on your local suppliers
The Last Emp again, down with Da Beatminerz
Rockin' wit'chu, we ain't forget 'chu, as we continue
Catch us at the venue, the hustler's theme

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town

Bounce wit em why'all

Now check it
Who get it live when the party dies down
Mysterious man showing up in your town
Lyrics like lightning, vocals like thunder

Neighborhood success or the overnight wonder
Uh, precise on mics but nice with the toe-to-toe
A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes

I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see why'all came
In the summertime banging at the be	-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block

With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even
We set the bar high everybody start reaching, cause?.

[Chorus]
Who said I couldn't get it down like this
Some tried to get it but they got it like this
Put you in a mix, get your body the twist
It's the mystery man, that the fans can't resist

Six sold M-K-T playin the corner
Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona

See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys ?hey hold up?
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up

Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil

Despite your size and them serious thighs
The long eyelashes and mysterious eyes
It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo?..

[Chorus: x 2]

Now if I wanted I could pump it in every club this week
But I pass cause it only adds to my mystique
If ya think that I'm weak then catch me out in the street
It ain't nothing to show me homie man we got this heat

That nigga that got all why'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets

Mystery man, never take my mask off
But when it comes to the raps I can act why'all
Non-stop flow that might flood the dance hall
Peace I'm out, be easy I get at why'all

The Last Emperor,"Yo, when I got the mic in my hand and the camera's on
I make the crowd get hype, and wanna blast this ??
Turnin' up is all good nigga, that's my song
Coast out through ya hood like a master don
My raps is long and strong like and elephant tusk
The intelligent, rough lyrics that the ample discuss
Crushed with the elephant man, can't you tell that it's us
Ain't no sittin' around now, then y'all better get up
East, west, north, south, yeah we callin' y'all out
Any opposition of this is just getttin' stomped out
We came to take it from the bottom to the top of the line
Party people, show me were you at one time

[Chorus]
From the front to the back, wherever you are
Rollin' tough in your truck, jumpin' out of ya car
Boastin' up in ya club or ya neighborhood bar

I hear the road call stomp out song, we need that
Come on, let's get it on and ease back
See the difference between me and these cats
My flow is strong, I spit creatine caps
Strong to the ladies, yeah they probably want me
I don't follow a blind lead, they follow me bluntly
Large appetite, my stomach is hollow, I'm hungry
I smack rappers like Solomon Grundi
As long as y'all want me I'ma come right back
And do what it takes to make a party bump like that
Uh, Mr. Martin Evil D on the track
Stomp it out y'all, show me where my people is at

Uh, I yell it out, I can't say it too plain
This is my jungle sucker, top of the food chain
I don't know what y'all thought when 2002 came
But this is my court and I'm runnin' the new game
I smash and dent and crash ya band
The glass and rim, blast them in, this is where my compassion ends
And I'ma make it quite clear check the captions kids
""Here we are"", right here's where's the action is
Poetical pachyderm packin' them in
Hoe catcher, dope snatcher, put my back to the wind
These rappers is no match, feel the back of my limb's
Stomp it out y'all, show them that we at it again

Over and over and over and over again now

(For all the women and men)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Here we go again)

[Verse 1]
He was a fly young cat, 23 to be exact
Ready to conquer the world fresh out of the pack
Comes from a small town, wrong side of the tracks
But somehow, he managed to slip through the cracks
He writes rhymes to escape what was awful and evil
Walks a fine line between lawful and legal
Seen a lot of bad times, there's a lot of good in him
Been around the world and still got the hood in him
If he carried a tech, would you call him a schemer?
If he sounds far fetched, would you call him a dreamer?
Stays true to himself, so he's not a deceiver
He found a lifetime job of making you a believer
Every now and then he would stare into space
And maybe think about if he had what it takes
He thinks about the hood and why he had to escape
And the family he left in that desolate place
It could be you or me or any man
Driving a sports car or a mini van
These are the aspirations of certain men
Who leave the neighborhood only to return again
Come on

(Chorus) (Last Emperor)

Over and over and over and over again now
(I know life around the way is hard)
Over and over and over and over again now
(You got a family, they need you God)
Over and over and over and over again now
(The aspirations of certain men)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Leave the neighborhood only to return again)

[Verse 2]
She was a sweet young thing, tender age of 20
Comes from a poor family with no money
Two children of her own, she never let them go hungry
There she is, all right you go honey
Early in life she had a chance to win
But she chose to put her future in the hands of men
Ever since her first love she was sure she could handle it
But in the end all she got was abandonment
Over and over again they seem to use her
From jerk to creep and from creep to loser
Come on mami, who would treat you like a friend?
You need somebody, when will the cycle end?
Another break up, you don't really love him girl
You better wake up; you're in trouble girl
But in her dreams she's a queen in another world
Easy, breezy, beautiful, cover girl
On the runway to Mr. Lover Man's charms
She breaks away from Mr. Lover Man's arms
And just when she was sure she had enough of men
She turns around and falls in love again
Come on

(Chorus) (Last Emperor)

Over and over and over and over again now
(Damn girl, why you got to go though this?)
Over and over and over and over again now
(I watch her stand there emotionless)
Over and over and over and over again now
(When nobody else noticed it)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Ooh, the sad songs from the vocalist)

Please embrace these stories
That have been placed before me
From hatred comes warring
From goodness must come glory
What is it I wonder
Some honor, some conquer
Different day, same drama
Remember it is karma

[Verse 3]
There's an old gray couple living right upstairs
Mid seventies, seemingly no cares
Always seem happy I can only guess why
Cause they barely getting by off the SSI (Hah)
Over the years their love affair grew
It was meant to be and some how they both knew
He said pray for me and I'll return to you
She waited faithfully during World War II
It was a hard time for a young couple just married
But they held on to the love they both carried
She read his letters telling her to stay strong
And on the phonograph played their favorite song (Yeah)
There were times they thought their love wouldn't make it
But like that old record, hard times couldn't break it
An old dusty record that they still hold sacred
And every anniversary I still here them play it
Yeah

(Chorus) (Last Emperor)

Over and over and over and over again now
(It was an old love affair)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Stand strong and they take it there)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Yes yes y'all)
Over and over and over and over again now
(We turn around and one day it's gone, come on)
Over and over and over and over again now
(I see you staying there)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Some times you got to take it there)",Karma,2003
The Last Emperor,"[The Last Emperor]
Everybody come with me, lets take a ride
Turn the system up loud, let it amplify
Look around at the town and let the sounds lead you
Everywhere I see the remice of a proud people
Where little girls find their way in the world through mama
And little guys see the world through the eyes of fathers
Everybody wanna learn I to earn a dollar
We know there's more to the hood than urban squallor
Now, I don't need to take up ya time
But I just wanted to know what's on ya mind
Whether work is hard to find, unemployment line
Or got a job or ya blind doin' overtime
Don't be ashamed, you got ya pride
To maintain, after the rain, the sun will shine
There will be better whether for everyone
Though we all move to the beat of a different drum
Passin' the time in a popular way
Like Otis Redding sitting at the dock of the bay
I got a long way on this road but hey
I take pride in the fact that I'm alive today

[Chorus: The Last Emperor]
Everybody on the east side, c'mon, let me know that you got ya pride
Everybody on the west side, c'mon, let me know that you got ya pride
Everybody on the north side, c'mon y'all, show me you got ya pride
And everybody on the south side, c'mon, let me know that you got ya pride

[The Last Emperor]
Summertime the heat is hot, will I ever reach the top
Yo it's time to leave the block, finish my tequila shot
Mellow but sober when I'm in the car
So I can ride to the rhythm of the guitar
I hear the music I'm prepared to follow
The body overcomes the city of El Dorado
Mexican City that's paved of gold
Made sacred by the ancients in days of old
Brown pride, they got it down to a science
That's right, Old Metz, Aztecs and Rions
Combined with colours of a tapestry
Yeah I hear my brown brothers hollarin back of me
From freedom fighters, to the band deleroes
To the old man wearin' the tan sanbrero
From the food in the music that's la fiesta
To the afternoon nap thats la siesta
""Never venture out the hood"" is what some people say
But I love it to much to ever keep away
Beautiful brown people in the streets today
Who show me love when I'm drivin' through Easter Lane
And they say..

[Chorus]

[The Last Emperor]
They got you to rock to a slower groove
I hope you like all the things that I'm showin' you
It's all good, every hood that I'm rollin' through
Ya might not notice me, but I notice you
Livin' your life through poverty, I see smiles for as long as the eye can see
I'm proud of y'all and I hope that your proud of me
God bless the child who runs wild and free
City to city and town to town
I can see alot of pride as I drive arouund
Hold ya heads up high when ya feelin' down
Remember y'all we gotta stand tall and proud

The Last Emperor," 

(Verse 1)
Deep concentration, mental penetration
Hits me off the paranormal psychic information
Imagine every be	-boy and girl in third world nations
Unite become one through pure hip-hop meditation
Watch me closely, I separate the spiritual from the ghostly
Tap the Emperor get struck down like Obi Wan Kenobi
I am hip-hop so hold me, but no one had ever told me
That corporate America would attempt to over-throw me
Secretly plant and grow me, light me up and then smoke me
Got you thinking your the Godfather like Vito Corleone
As an underground artist my days and nights below me
Signing a contract like King Salo, now everybody knows me
Righteousness oppose me, wicked women don't approach me
I am a player-hater so ??? Nelson couldn't coach me
I flipped animalistic's, and the critics tried to poach me
Turned a crew of battle-cats into pussy-cats like Josie
Oh don't play me closely, it's the music that controls me
Hip-hop is mother earth and in my infancy she holds me
Single parent see single handily shape and hold me
When they tried to enslave me she train me how to set my soul free
Bounty Hunters capture me, in carbonate they froze me
I am the Dark Oder my two sons are Thor and Ockie
In the beginning there was the word and in the sentence hip-hop wrote me
If you're brave enough to meditate then come along and show me!

(Verse 2)
I'm an extra-terrestrial emcee, and I know some are doubting me
Like Han Solo fighting style, like awe Millennium Falcon me
I change shapes and mind states through the use of mental alchemy
I climbed the Tower of Babylon and through rappers of the balcony
My culture showers me, the microphone overpowers me
Separates me from rappers who use actions that are cowardly
That's how it be, hip-hop amazes me worships, praises me
Resembles favours me, allows me many ways to freak
Seven styles for seven days a week
Allows me to transform like soundwave and give up more tapes than Laser Beak
The things you see in life hip-hop provides you, over-rides you
Let the spirit of hip-hop get up inside you
There was a shoulder to lead on, but I had the one to cry to
Help me pick up the pieces made me hot enough to fly through
Tried to fly through, jacking me for my faculty
Half of these emcees get lost in space like Dr. Zachary
I jetted for the goal-line A and are's kept trying to tackle me
Sacked me and grappled me, I was the righteous of an athlete
At first I was alone now there's a 1000 kids that backing me
Finally got a deal and now the CIA are tracking me
I didn't mean to do it socialism just came naturally
I think it's time to meditate, my sentiments exactly

(Verse 3)
In the world filled with petulance and hatred
Some say we'll be rescued by spaceships
I stay away from crooks and study books by the ages
When the world gets to crazy hip-hop helps me escape it
No gravity I am weightless, broke from poverty to greatness
I create this and built this, kid rackets smelt the fragrance
One love, One blood I got rhymes buried in my platelage
You can state this, crease this, place this with emphasis
Now enter this, take shots like Islamic fundamentalists
Degenerate rappers I'm smashing attackin' with a passion
A-and-are-bashin', ripping lyrics built on fashion
Now imagine you just won a trip around my way
Full transportation all expenses paid
I've never been a player just the one who got played
Now my style kills more kids then Rouge versus Wade
Don't be afraid to join us on this hip-hop meditation
Where you encounter evil spirits, release hip-hop and let it chase them
And place them over here, forget the clothes that you be wearing
My style is matter free, I'm free but don't you go comparing
Your weekly shopping-sprees versus my bargain basement shopping
Your religion versus my black magic concoction
Tae-quando and boxing, moving soldiers to my locksmith
Your biodegradable rhymes to my lethal toxin
Rhyming is a gift and not an option
I gave birth to more styles then half you emcees got through adoption
Be careful of the lyrics and the rhymes that you be dropping
Cause while we meditate the whole universe is watching!!!",Meditation,2003
The Last Emperor,"1993, shortly before Thanksgiving
I got the call, she said Jamal Derek is not longer living
Softly she spoke, is this a joke? Man you gotta be kidding
As my question was raised this explanation was given
A meaningless death made me question the meaning of life
Does my body remain at rest like when I'm sleeping at night?
Will I burn in eternal hell or will I find paradise?
Be rejected or resurrected like the body of Christ?
Is it like purgatory, the story described by the Catholics?
Or Nirvana that Buddhists honor in both theory and practice?
Like I study in my college philosophy classes
Or do my molecules and atoms travel back to the gases?
I mean, what I like to know, is where my spirit goes?
After the curtains close, on my final show?
Is there a pain it brings? Enjoy my favorite things?
Visit ancient kings? Hear the angels sing?
Who'll answer these said the great MCs
My man Gribbles battling a debilitating disease
He said you see a brother like me is willing to fight
And everytime I question death my only answer is life

[Chorus]
One life, yeah
And my God will set me free
Am I living in this moment
Am I living righteously
It gets hard
But I know I got to keep on
I'm trying so hard to be strong

Paralyzed on the bathroom floor by pain
Last month I endured, but now I can't ignore
Feels like railroad spikes being stuck in my liver
Am I dying? Eyes crying, body starting to shiver
Crawl upstairs from the basement calling my sister
(Sniff) Dawn help me, I ain't feeling too healthy
Stomach walls burning, head spinning and turning
Waiting for the EMS; 3:10 in the morning
Rush me to the emergency screaming like a newborn
The pain's too strong maybe my soul's trying to move on
They hook me to the I.V., put me through some X-Rays
Gave me Demerol to kill the pain that was the next phase
Early the next day in the hospital room
Moms and pops in the room, three or four docs in the room
Test results suggest your colon and your liver
Is so cancerous you got three months left
Me and Death is playing chess ever since then
My strength is the most high, my fam and close friends

Staying healthy comes first
Look at me things could be worst

The Last Emperor," 

Now if I loved you, would you love me back?
Would you confess that I was the best that you've ever had?
Would you allow me to hold you, show you exotic lands?
Well there's no need to look any further, you've got your man

Turn of the lights; let me close the door
Two bodies, one common cause, I'll fill your ways to explore
Would you be willin to be empress to an Emperor?
Stop frontin; come get somethin, you never felt before
Now that I got it, never let another.take it from me
You need it, I can see it, I can tell by the way you touch me
Mourn for me when I'm gone, although while thinking of me
Allow me one moment in time, I'ma make you love me

Now if I loved you, would you love me back?
Would you confess that I was the best that you've ever had?
Would you allow me to hold you, show you exotic lands?
Well there's no need to look any further, you've got your man

What is it that you desire, your highness? Ask I listen
Someone above the average thug or man or vision
Let me be your knight with shining armour, a man with riches
Be the genie, in your magic land, be grant your wishes
Play the starring roll, be the leading actor
Let me be the Mark Anthony to your Cleopatra
Your only protector, once I got ya, let me get at cha
Quicken your pulse, have your heart.beatin faster
Be the master of your happiness, to keep it hole
Be the spouse, come and live in my house, give me a home
Would you accept it, Dis-agreed or hate it.leave me alone?
Or love it, like Mike. Douglas and Catharine Zeta Jones

Now if I loved you, would you love me back?
Would you confess that I was the best that you've ever had?
Would you allow me to hold you, show you exotic lands?
Well there's no need to look any further, you've got your man

Now could you find another guy to satisfy.your every need?
Every dimension, inch of the earth and the seven seas?
I'm that person, end your searching 'cause I got what you need
For me too guide you, ain't no problem, juss follow my leads
Come my direction under my protection, I'll take you there
No question my love's perfected, yea you can say it's rare

Would you let me know the intimate things that you think about?
You gotta make me a father, come on and juss have my child

Would you confess that I was the best that you've ever had?
Would you allow me to hold you, show you exotic lands?
Well there's no need to look any further, you've got your man",Shine,2003
The Last Emperor,"This is a single story, for every single one
On a single planet, under a single sun
In a single solar system some think it's odd
Entire galaxy created by a single god
With a single thought, and a single plan
Single earth fashioned by a single hand
7 continents separated from a single land
Many nations are created from a single man
A single nation taken to a single place
Where they simply aren't familiar with a single face
Yet this is not the story of a single struggle
A single symbolism, nor a single couple
A young couple, who raise a single seed
Sworn protectors of her every single need
Forming a single balance, under a single order
From a single act of love they have a single daughter
Along her way she put her faith in a single lover
And from a single lie she became a single mother
Of a single son, born to a single girl
Single home alone, in a single world
Though her kids felt her single pain
With a single kiss she makes everything okay
I wrote this record in a single way
So the radio will play it every single day

I dedicate this to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

Dedicated to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

You were my first teacher, my first friend
Gave me my first vision, and my first glimpse
Of a bigger world, given me my first look
Tuck me in my bed, and read my first book
And as I fell asleep, for the first time
Little did I know you were showing me my first rhyme
I want to thank you for showing me
How to be a man and turn my pain into poetry
Break my silence, express myself vocally
How to show the world what was once done locally
First one to take me on my quest for learning
First one to help me through life's stressful journey
And every single step, I'm coming with ya
Cause I belong to a strong single mother figure
You were the first one to tell me I was something bigger
I was an Emperor not just another nigger
First one to show me how I might be strong
The days seemed shorter and the night seemed long
Maybe that's the reason that I write these songs
To set the record straight and try to right these wrongs
This is the saga of a single mother
That's been provided by a single brother
I had to write it in a single way
So the radio will play it every single day

I dedicate this to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

Another lonely day, another lonely night
I dedicate this to y'all yeah its only right
Another untold truth is now brought to light
Another lesson is learned cause you taught me right
When I lost my way and the road got lonely
Only you, you were the one who showed me
Only you, you were the one to hold me
Sometimes I feel like you're the only one who knows me
And if you gotta stay single, hey
You should know this, I wrote this in a single way
The only thing I can do is pray
That the radio will play it every single day

I dedicate this to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

The Last Emperor,"[Chorus]
We get it on, in the place; let them have it they can't wait
They get ghost, we give chase, can't run now there's no escape
Last Emp, why you tearing it down?
Why you make them put they ear to the ground?
Why they hearing it now?
Tell them now while you wearing the crown
If you afraid, leave your fear in the house, 'cause we letting them out

[Verse 1]
I prowl like a tiger, growl like a tiger
Let a nigga come around, pounce like a tiger
Deadly rhymes I announce and pounce when I write them
Wild out in my own house when I write them
I mean, he's way cool, he breaks rules
Gets cash in bundles, but he's paid dues
Wild type of dudes, wild type of crews
Run wild in jungles, caged up in zoos
Most niggaz feel it, some niggaz fear it
Eye of the tiger, come, come, catch the spirit
Any man come near it, track down and kill it
He attacked the village, ransacked and pillage
Scarp for your life, strap on your knife
Bring a gat if you like, just earn your stripes
When attacking the mic, sike, you can't get close
I kidnap bitch ass rappers and slash they throats
Cold rip through your tissue, crack open bones
Go grab your rifles and pack your toast
Don't blast and run, let's have some fun
Your man pass his gun, your ass is done

[Chorus] w/variation

[Verse 2]
I used to be a quiet type cat, silent type cat
Nigga fuck with me, wouldn't even fight back
Now I'm straight out the jungle 'cause I got it like that
Now this dude's on the loose, tiger strike back
I be the wild, no caring, stingy note sharing
Fuck us up, knuckle up, known for throat tearing
Now I'm quite thuggish, now I'm quite rugged
Ghost In The Darkness, too hard for Mike Douglas
Ghost that might haunt ya, Tim's that might stomp ya
Scar any face, many places he conquered
Animal slash author, man but yet monster
Bangladesh, Borneo, Sri Lanka, Sumatra
How the hell can you catch a nigga that's just too fresh?
Tiger that's this ruthless, try to track the movement
y'all niggaz is clueless, y'all weapons is useless
In this urban jungle we rumble across the U.S
Do this!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My tiger squad came to tear it down, y'all better beware it now
Coming through, hear the sound, pack it up, clear it out
Run and take the nearest route, we all up in your house
You see the tiger crouch, yeah you know what I'm about
Live a man, tiger man, every time I write a jam
I excite the tiger land, play me close I bite a fan
Rip it, tear it up and shred it, slash, slice, behead it
All y'all suckers in get debted, tell them how we came to set it

[Chorus]
We get it on, in the place; let them have it they can't wait
They get ghost, we give chase, can't run now there's no escape
Flow like water, some may say, water from an ancient lake
We came off beats that jump, tell us if we tore it up

The Last Emperor,"To all my brothers who be putting it down
In the underground
For all my soldiers for protecting our crown
In the underground
Where all the wickedest lyricist found
In the underground
Who got the beats and the rhythms that pound?
It's the underground
Come here me now, feel me now

This is hardcore music, God's war music
The heart of hip hop, the blood that flows through it
Made for the chosen people that have been deprived
Though they sentence us to death, we still keep it live
Who bring the heat to these streets where we dropping these rhymes?
With a power that's refined and them cowards can't find
Who reveals God's design, cause its finally time
To speak out for those who live below the poverty line
See...

Underground is the defying thing
Well protected from the tyrant king
There is a message that we try and bring
Underground is where we cry and sing
Some, they kill for fun, but we not run
Cause we got guns, in the face of oppression
We fire back and ask without no question
Nooo

Who got that underground sound that you rocking with? (Who?)
Who keep it real and still appeal to a lot of chicks? (Who?)
I'm from a block that stays hot like the Gaza Strip
On the corner between hip hop and politics
See all my underground followers rocking with me
Where all my underground rhyme slayers keep it witty
And all my underground beat makers keep it gritty
Cause we provide the soundtrack for the inner city
Where the high price of rent ain't fair
Little dudes rock the same suits that inmates wear
Bullshit politicians pretend they care
And if the party ain't jumping then the Emp ain't there
I run with crooks and read books but utilize both gifts
Born and raised in West Philly but I ain't Will Smith
And you can catch me on the O, I'm controlling the spliff
Around the way they call me Maul, the Dark Lord of the Sith
In this...

The Last Goodnight,"I let you in just a little too close
You shut the door, so nobody would know
I know I heard a shot on the fourteenth floor
The music was raw, you really put on a show

This is where we are
This is where we've been
This is how I fall
In love with you again

I had to say goodbye before I said hello
I saw you crash and you took off your clothes

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
I won't survive very much longer
You got to keep this broken heart stronger

This is where we are
This is where we've been
This is how I fall
In love with you again

Where did I go wrong?
I can't be your friend
After where we've been
I can't see your face again

You leave your troubles at the door
And I feel we don't know what we're fighting for

Feels like I'm a prisoner, baby
So hard when you have to fake it
It hurts so much to feel love
When you know you've got to break it

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
I won't survive very much longer
You got to keep this broken heart stronger

This is where we are
This is where we've been
This is how I fall
In love with you again

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
(where did I go wrong)
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
(I can't be your friend)

I won't survive very much longer
(after where we've been)
And this is the sound of a broken heart stronger
(I can't see your face again)

I fall for you again
I fall for you again
I fall for you again, woah

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
(I fall for you again)
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
(I fall for you again)

I won't survive very much longer
(I fall for you again)
You got to keep this broken heart stronger

Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
We know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't know and they goes
The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole

The Last Poets,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?

The Last Poets,"Selfish desires are burning like fires
among those who hoard the gold
As the continue to keep the people asleep
and the truth from being told
Racism and greed keep the people in need
from getting what's rightfully theirs
Cheating, stealin and double dealing
as they exploit the peoples fears

Now, Dow Jones owns the people's homes
and all the surrounding land
Buying and selling their humble dwelling
in the name of the Master Plan

'cause paper money is like a bee without honey
with no stinger to back him up
and those who stole the people's gold
are definitely corrupt

Credit cards, master charge, legacies of wills
real-estate, stocks and bonds on coupon paper bills
Now the US mints on paper prings, millions every day
and use the eagle as their symbol 'cause it's a bird of prey

The laurels of peace and the arrows of wars
are clutched very tightly in the eagles claws
filled with greed and lust,
and on the back of the dollar bill, 
is the words IN GOD WE TRUST

But the dollar bill is their only God
and they don't even trust each other
for a few dollars more they'd start a war
to exploit some brother's mother
Then there's the pyramid, that stands by itself
created by Black people's knowledge and wealth
and over the pyramid hangs the devil's eye
that stole from the truth and created the lie

Now ANNUIT means and endless amount stolen over the years
and COEPTIS means a new empire of vampire millionaires
And NOVUS is a Latin word meaning something new
an ORDO means a way of life chosen by a few
SECLORUM is a word that means to take from another
knowledge, wisdom and understanding stolen from the brother

Roman numerals on the base of the pyramid's face
tell the date they began to exist
when they established this branch of hell
in seventeen-seventy-six

Now there are thirteen layers of stone of the pyramid alone
an unfinished work of art
for thirty-three and a third is as high as a mason can go
without falling apart

Thirteen stars in the original flag!
Thirteen demons from the Devil's bag!
Thirteen berries and thirteen leaves!
Thirteen colonies of land-grabbing thieves!
Thirteen arrows in the eagle's claws!
Sixty-seven corporations wage the Devil's wars!
Thirteen stripes on the eagle's shield!
And these are the symbols on the US seal!

Now on the front of the dollar bill
to the right of Washington's head
is a small seal in the shape of a wheel
with the secret that's been left unsaid
The symbols in the middle represent the riddle
of the scales, the ruler and the key;
the square rule is a symbol
from the craft of masonry
The scales represent Libra
the balance of the seventh sign
They also represent the Just-Us
which you and I know is blind
The key unlocks the mysteries
of the secrets of the seal
So that only the Govern-you-men
would know what they reveal

The four words apart form the last parts of 
the secrets of the seal
and tells how they fooled the people
into thinking paper money was real!

Now, THESAUR means the treasury
where they store the gold they stole
and AMER means to punish
like the slaves they bought and sold
Then SEPTENT means seven
like seventeen-seventy-six
when the thirteen devils gathered
to unleash their bag of tricks
The SIGEL means the images
they've created to fool the world
like the colors on Old Glory
the flag that they unfurled

Now the red was the color of the Indian man
White was the devil's who stole the land
Blue was the eyes that hypnotised
with the tricks and traps they sprung
and even to this very same day
they all speak with forked tongue!
And so the power is in the hand of the ruling classes
playing god with the fate of all the masses
so the people don't get any in the land of the plenty
because E PLURIBUS UNUM means One Out Of Many",E Pluribus Unum [From Chastisement],1996

Que humadera que nos viente ahogando
la gente se pregunta nadie sabe qué es
Un carra viejo que viene pitando
con llantas de triciclo y el motor al revés

Y tampoco me a me avergüenzo yo de mi galán
Aunque sea pobre y tenga un carra viejo
Me saca como reina
Un hombre de verdad

Y aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero sí es mi novio fiel

And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows but me

They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

How, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.

Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?
You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

On merely this: a look, a kiss

And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at this moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know 
I was not born to follow

The Lemon Pipers,"Drop your silver in my tambourine
Help a poor man fill his pretty dream
Give me pennies, I'll take anything
Now listen while I play
My green tambourine

Watch the jingle jangle start to chime
Reflections of the music that is mine
When you toss a coin you'll hear it sing
Now listen while I play
My green tambourine

Drop a dime before I walk away
Any song you want I'll gladly play
Money feeds my music machine
Now listen while I play

It's very special and only accepts what is true
In that world of lavender things

In love's world of blueberry blue

Peppermint leaves on lollipop trees, just open your eyes
Come take my hand lets go for a ride on blue butterflies
I'm so glad I'm in love with you
Stay with me and together we will share forever

Love's world of blueberry blue

Look at the moon it's a big blue balloon, it's a blueberry night
Look at the sun it's a strawberry one

The Lemonheads,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home.

 Bright shining as the sun; 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise 
 Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,1987

The Lemonheads,"We hit the highway in the shimmer glare of summer
And past the window all the trees flew by behind her
She tuned the radio 'til music was around us
A rushing calm around my heart I knew had found us
 
It feels so good to me
I have to make you see
Why does this ever have to end?
I know commitment is not the trend
Don't misunderstand what I intend
When I say this doesn't have to end

We washed the dishes knowing everything was all right
And there together in the curtain drifting twilight
I know your laughter shouldn't make me feel so scared
How could I doubt you, I know how much you cared

I hear it when you sigh
But I still don't know why

Why does this ever have to end?
Why can't I give you my heart and hand?
I think you're too scared to understand
This doesn't ever have to end...go!

I see you standing by a window in the hall
Our eyes collide without a single word at all
The record asks, ""will you still need me when I'm sixty four?""
I can't imagine that I wouldn't need you more
Too many tears to cry
I just won't let it die

This doesn't ever have to end

You are my lover, you're my best friend 
But this doesn't ever have to end

You never give me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Time out, times up
I really gotta go
Gotta find a way to let you know that
I'm fed up with you, don't know what to do
Wish you felt it too
I'm fed up with you
Sit around and watch TV all day
Stare at me and ask me what to say

Think I'll say it again

The Lemonheads,"I like to pick things up and drop them down again
I like to go nowhere tell no one where I've been

I dig laughing in your face and telling what I've seen
Hurting myself and being mean
I like to

It's a bitch to be simple
It's a bitch to be free
It's a bitch to come down where you ought to be",I Like To,1987
The Lemonheads,"It's not me, this disease
It's not you, that's not true
It's our fault, me and you
Most of all, you're not you

I dream of you, it's nothing new
I dream of you, it's nothing true

It's not you, that's not true

The Lemonheads,"See it over there and in between my teeth
Rat velvet
It`s everything I look
And everywhere I feel
Tooth crack under foot and death`s head
Rustles near
Coup deville in sign
Cushioned razor smear
Rat velvet
Love my mom and pop
They gave me the rope
Buttocks scream coagulating
Never give up hope
Love my dog and cat
Shards of summer`s blood
Tooth defying death relying
Harold's under mud
Hate my mothers smirk
Hemaroidal hinge
Laminated glory faded
Mama's on a binge
Chew my daddys
Underneath the porch
Slicey dicey oncee-twicee
Grandma baby
Pass the torch",Rat Velvet,1987
The Lemonheads,"Misdirected girls in town just a layin' down by a pool.
Check the scene check all 'round, 
Be sure 'n act a fool.

But you say that it's all right.
You go out night after night.
You're sad girl. 
Ain't it a shame?
You're sad girl. 
Aren't you a pain?

Been around for quite some time, 
There's other's been around longer still.

I've been down, I've been in lonely places

Now you say you're feeling different
Been a long time since I heard your voice
Telling me lies I always believe in
Now you're saying something different
Now you're saying something different

Maybe you've seen it all before
But I'm gonna tell you something more
There's no such thing as a second chance
There's no such thing as another try
There's no such thing as starting all over
All you ever did was make me cry

Been a long time since I've seen your eyes
Looking at me, looking through me
Now you're looking somehow different
Now you're looking somehow different
Been a long time since I felt your touch
Pulling me closer, and I can't fight you

The Lemonheads,"I know a girl and she's all that 
I love in the world
And I don't even know what she's thinking now
If I could be with her tonight
I know the arguing and the spite
We'd shout together and fight about whatever
Was wrong or was right 
It seems that doesn't matter
But if we could slow down and listen hard
Stupid arguing disregard
Love is heat with a light
Love's a sound you can't hear
When we are far far apart 
When we are too near
If I could show you the picture in my heart
If I could stop the words before they start",Uhhh,1987
The Lemonheads,"And it's so good to hear him whispering his wishes inside you.
Play along, there is no wrong,
You've got to let him guide you.
You're the first sweet little girl to have this love of mine.
Forever with me till the end of time.
Time!

Wake up baby to the fact that you're poor soul's unclever.
Change your mind give me your life,
And you can live forever.

You've got to let him guide you.
It's so good to feel him whispering his wishes inside you.

I got to keep it in my soul.
I got to protect it,
I must believe it,
It's my code.

I must believe it, it's my code.

(spoken):
And then I went to the end of it, and the old man, well, he's ready to die.
And he said, ""well, tom, sincerity's the best gimmick. remember that.""
And I say, ""all right, be sincere, that'll win it? "" he said, ""that's it.
Sincerity and honesty,"" he said, ""will do it. it'll trick 'em every time.""
I said, ""well, sincerity and honesty; I never tried that.""

The night is almost over, she can't wait

A token of my love for her collection, her collection

Plaster caster, grab a hold of me faster
And if you want to see my love, just ask her
And my love is the plaster, and yeah she's the collector
She wants me all the time to inject her

The Lemonheads,"Verse 1:

Once I thought I was more right than wrong,
Painting myself in the corner.
What I bought and why it takes so long,
Something inside of her warned her.

Chorus:

I know that it doesn't matter much
But I hope we'll, keep in touch.
I know that we won't go on as such
But I hope we'll, keep in touch.
Could it be that hard,
To send you a postcard?

Verse 2:

Fragile smile, a ragged sleeve,
Didn't laugh once to often. (pause)
Before a while, it takes to grieve,
Try to repair what I've done.

Chorus

You laugh across the kitchen,
At something in a magazine.
I frown across the table,
So blunt, I'm never seen.
Your hair falls in your eyes as you ask
""what do you mean? ""

Verse 3:

See yourself never satisfied,
In the clothes that you try now.
I swore myself, I said I'd never cry.
Close to saying goodbye now.

Last chorus:

I know that it doesn't matter much
But I'm hoping to keep in touch.

But, they'll never show you their peace of mind
'Cause they don't know how to be free

Leave your past behind
You can do what you want to do
'Cause you're strong in your mind

You can make that your home

The Lemonheads,"Boy, the way Glen Miller played
Songs that made the hit parade
Guys like us we had it made

Those were the days
This could be habitual
This could be a ritual
Grown up learned to take it slow

Those were the days
Burning down a blaze
Downtown stays
Don't ever go
You know I need you so take it slow",7 Powers,1988

I loved you so but that was long ago
When it only takes a day
It doesn't matter anyway

You're only lonely when you let yourself get strong
Get too strong

Look at your catastrophe
Look at me how it has to be
Say goodbye, it's all the past to me
Just don't try
Not the last to be

And you've thrown away the choice
And lost your ticket

He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names

I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

I was living my life as an Anglican.
Let me tell you how I changed to a baptiste man.
One night I was walking down Frederick Street
Poor and hungry
No shoes on my feet.
I passed the door that said: ""Down with sin"" !
It was the smell of food that pulled me in.
We are goin' down Jordan...
Well
The leader woke up and shook my hand
Said:""Iwant you to be a holy man""
Right away I made a quick decision
My stomach was groaning for this true religion.
I started over to get some food
When some of my sisters approached me in a mysteric mood.
Duck me in the water for five times
I couldn't see a thing I cause I was almost blind.

Why must our love be like a game of hide-and-seek?

It's reported you've been drinking and a-runnin' 'round with men and going wild
And we don't believe you ought to be bringing up your little girl this way""

They were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin

And visit a nearby tower

Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying : ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""
""No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""

I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play ?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me ?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?  What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Like the changing in my mind and I chased the leaves
Like the words I never find, like the people I knew
Who I sometimes see today some still bright like fire
And some faded away

I turn on the radio and someone's playing a song
I turn on the news, hear what's going on
I turn on my back when I'm full of beer
And I turn off the news when I don't want to hear

And I've seen a girl who looks so very sad
Nothing left but a memory of all the times she's had
And I've seen a man who looks so sad inside
Nothing left but the memories from which he cannot hide

So I learned to fight with a weapon called the word
And I learned to rise my voice so that I'd be heard
And I learned to fight with a weapon called the word
And I learned to raise my voice but I've never been heard

Said the man in the bar with his head in his hands
Trying his best to understand the cause of his dismay

And left him cold where he fitted in
It's too late to turn around and find another way

All the lights in the late night lock-in
Fade away when he gets in
And the girl from fifteen years ago
Has packed and gone away
She said it'll never be what it used to be 
What happened to all that energy
You took too many liberties, and I'm tired of being afraid 
So night after night she took flight
Hiding swollen eyes and a wounded pride
The best years of her life denied, sold for liquid shares

The victims of this world, are advertised on posters
A beach and a pretty girl, if you just drink their potion
It's another week 'til his cheque comes through

But the doors of the bar are open, and he breaks another rule
He sits on the stool that bears his name
His favorite glass is called the same 
And he's never kept waiting, 'cause he pays the landlord's wage",15 Years,1992
The Levellers,"Dance before the storm
These are dangerous time we live in
I heard a man once say
If you're prone to flights of fancy
Your dreams can fly away

See the sights around you
Of breakdown and decay
Wrought by the greed for a better life
For which you have to pay

From Glasgow town to London
Down the motorway
There's people standing in the rain
Looking for any way

To take them down to where they're bound
It's a part of another way
It's called the art of survival
In a modern age

Dance before the storm
Don't look back to where you've been
The horror's even further
As the sands of time run thin

Dance before the storm
As the machinery breaks down
Watch the sky go black with anger
But no one makes a sound

From Albion Hill to the Old Chain Pier
You can hear a person say
Spare some change for all me pains
So if your head spins round, go underground

Away from the games they play
People down there are trying to care
And let each one have their say

It's not revolution tactics
Or cause for anarchy
Just a natural fight for a natural life
Of which systems are afraid

And if it all surrounds you
Seems like there's no escape
And there's someone stood in front of you
Saying do it in their way

Turn your eyes towards the tides
See how they never change
The sands of time will break their mime
Like riding on a wave

",Dance Before the Storm,1992
The Levellers,"I met you in 82, over a crate of beer and not a few 
I cracked a can and so did you, we're going to change the world 
The ghetto kings of downside town-the estates and parks of our hallowed ground 
Doing anything that we found, and on the river flowed 

You'd take a drink from Rev. Jimmy Jones
You'd cross the street on the path the gunman roams 
Thrown aside and left to waste, that was you - you knew your place 
Wander round, get off your face, and on the river flowed

On and on the river flow - we are the undertow 
On and on the river flow - we are the undertow 

I don't know how you made it through all the smoke and brew you do 
It sure has left its mark on you but you're still with us today 
Life goes on and round we go and words can kill these things I know 
Sometimes you cut deeply so, but on the river flows

You'd set the table for barber Sweeney Todd 
You'd clip the wings of any rising god 
But man can't live on hope alone, it can be cut all that is grown
Broke your spirit but not your bones and on the river flows 

CHORUS 

You're working now - forced to the race 
I know it left a bitter taste 
But the rising tide had covered your face 
Nothing you could do 
But I still remember the day you said 
That the river flowing through my head 
Would take me far or leave me dead 
And all you said was true 
",Riverflow [Live],1992
The Levellers,"Gunshots shatter the peace of night
it's just another fire fight
for the people of this little town
but for the dying soldier
he's feeling ten yerars older
and he's lying face down on the ground
all the words that are in his head 
are all the words his mother said
as she would put him to bed back home

CHORUS:
your daddy died in the falklands 
fighting for another man's cause
and your brother he was killed in the last war
now your mother's lying at home alone

Every day she sees his face 
on the picture on the fireplace
with your brother as he was leaving school 
then a day came five years ago
you said ""mother, i need to know""
and you spoke the words your brother spoke before
""i know the things my daddy done
i've seen the medals thet he won
and i know that this is what he would have wanted-for me""

CHORUS

AND NOW SHE WONDERS AT IT ALL
HOW MANY MORE ARE GOING TO ANSWER THE CALL
TO FIGHT AND DIE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY'S 
TO DIE FOR RELIGION THE NEVER BELIVED IN AT ALL
TO DIE IN A PLACE THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AT ALL
NO, NEVER BEEN AT ALL

",Another Man's Cause,1992
The Levellers,"I thought I heard someone calling me 
I've seen the pictures on TV
And I made up my mind that I would go and see
With my own eyes

It didn't take too long to hitch a ride 
With a guy going south to start a new life 
Past the place where my friend died 
Two years ago

Down the 303 at the end of the road 
Flashing lights - exclusion zones 
And it made me think it's not just the stones 
That they're guarding 

Hey, hey, can't you see 
There's nothing here that you can call free 
They're getting their kicks
Laughing at you an me

As the sun rose on the Beanfield
They came like wolf on the fold
And they didn't give a warning
They took their bloody toll

I see a pregnant woman
Lying in blood of her own 
I see her children crying 
As the police tore apart her home

And no they didn't need a reason
It's what your votes condone 
It seems they were committing treason
By trying to live on the road

As the sun rose on the Beanfield
They came like wolf on the fold
And they didn't give a warning
They took their bloody toll",Battle of the Beanfield,1992
The Levellers,"If I could choose the life I pleased
Then I would be a boatman
Along the canals and the rivers free 
No hasty words are spoken 
My only law the river breeze 
Would take me to the open seas 
If I could choose the life I pleased
Then I would be a boatman

If I could choose the life I pleased 
Then I would be a rover
And if the road was not for me 
Then I would choose another
Across mountains and valleys deep 
I would take these weary feet
If I could choose the life I pleased 
Then I would be a rover

But these things are so hard for me
I cannot choose my own destiny 
And all the things that I want to see 
Are so unclean

I wish I could choose the life I please 
But I am not a free man
Others choose my destiny 
But my will is never broken
I know someday I will be
Everything that I dreamed I'd be
If I could choose the life I pleased
Then I would be a boatman",The Boatman,1992
The Levellers,"It's warm by the river, the weir keeps us clean
The woodsmoke and cigarettes are all that we need
Marking the dirt with twigs and simple words spoke
Kicking the dust so we can just

Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play it inspired
You said that you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever

It's cool by the sea when the pavement is hot
We take a walk down there to see what we've got
An old man collecting fifty beautiful words
Cleaning the beach so he can teach us to

Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play it inspired
You said that you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever

It's cold by the pane glass on the high street we played
But there's always a penny in the music we made
So far from home with no means of return
Burning bridges, so we always

Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play it inspired
You said that you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever

We're so far from home
No need to return
There's so much that we have taught
And so much that we have learned",Far from Home,1992
The Levellers,"I never was a violent man 
Said the man in the bar with his head in his hands 
Trying his best to understand the cause of his dismay 
But years of gin have broken him 
And left him cold where he fitted in
It's too late to turn around and find another way 
All the lights in the late night lock-in 
Fade away when he gets in 
And the girl from fifteen years ago 
Has packed and gone away 
She said it'll never be what it used to be 
What happened to all that energy 
You took too many liberties, and I'm tired of being afraid 
So night after night she took flight 
Hiding swollen eyes and a wounded pride 
The best years of her life denied, sold for liquid shares 
CHORUS 
The victims of this world, are advertised on posters 
A beach and a pretty girl, if you just drink their potion 
It's another week 'til his cheque comes through
He's got a fiver left to spend on food
But the doors of the bar are open, and he breaks another rule 
He sits on the stool that bears his name 
His favorite glass is called the same 
And he's never kept waiting, 'cos he pays the landlord's wage 
CHORUS",Fifteen Years,1992
The Levellers,"The Bar was dark, quiet and still
And nothing could be heard
The dust lay undisturbed
At a table near the back, underneath a fan
Two men shared a joke about the normal folk

The cards are on the table
The winners takes it all
The game is nearly over
One man about to fall

I don't believe in heaven
I don't believe in hell
I don't believe what I'm seeing
This is no game, can't you tell

""I'm calling your bluff"" the first man said
""The people went to war, they always wanted more
How could I ever fail to lose
They can't take it any more, they want to end the score""

The second man showed his hand
Some walked barefoot across the land
Many have seen the future
And are doing the best they can

[Chorus]
The clock ticked past the final hour
Which of the men had lost? and what was the cost?
The glasses now were empty and gone
To wash away the shame, and take away the pain

One man left the table
The other, head in hands
Paid the bill for the defeated
the only thing left that stands

[Chorus]",The Game,1992
The Levellers,"There's one too many, two too many holes
Getting bigger in the garden wall
And the people looking in are getting busy,getting bad
Trying to suss it all
They're trying to get to me, to take my liberty

Got to o, go, go on, get out of here,'cause
This means nothing to me
The way we were is the way I want to be

They're sending in the elite, complete with guns
To advertise the way to go
Faxing through the fax to make it clear 
That they're the ones who know
They;re trying to get to me, to take my liberty

Got to o, go, go on, get out of here,'cause

The Levellers,"There's only one way of life
And that's your own

My father when I was younger
Took me up on to the hill
That looked down on the city smog
Above the factory spill
He said this is where I come
When I want to be free
Well he never was in his lifetime
But these words stuck with me

I ran from all of this
And I climbed that highest hill
And looked down on my life
Above the factory spill
I looked down onto my life
As the family disgrace
Then to all my friends on the starting line
Their wages off to chase
and all my friends and all their jobs
And all the bloody waste

CHORUS

I grew up, learned to love and laugh
Circled A's on the underpass
But the noise we thought would never stop
Died a death as the punks grew up
And we choked on our dreams
We wrestled with our fears 
Running through the heartless concrete streets
Chasing our ideas

And the problems of the world
Won't be solved by this guitar
And they won't stop coming either 
By the life I've had so far
And the bright lights of my home town
Won't be getting any dimmer 
Though their calling has receded now
Like some old distant singer
And they don't seem so appealing
To the eyes of this poor sinner

And isn't nature wonderful 
But is this art? 

They took me to the hospital 
And pulled aside the sheet
Said 'Look at that pulsating.
Just listen to the beat' 
And they showed me the incision 
Then took away the heart
And isn't nature wonderful
But is this art? 

They took me to the scientist, 
Who opened up a phial
He said 'This is only chicken pox 
And rhino bile' 
And they showed me what it did to mice
They said 'This is just the start' 
And isn't nature wonderful
But is this art? 

They took me to the tenement
And kicked down the door
They said:'Have you seen the copulation, 
Practiced by the poor 
We select the ones to breed
Then we reject the part'

The Levellers,"Julie was a lonely girl
She said she was born that way 
She always felt that way 
She left home at age sixteen 

Got a job what you're supposed to do 
That's what you've got to do 
She fell in love and settled down 
In a council place there on the edge of town 

She'd feel alone in a crowded room 
Cry when she heard a happy tune 
It would be nice to holiday 
Till they took her job away 

They just took her life away 
Doing nothing isn't fun 
When you've nothing from which to run 
You've nowhere left to run 

She'd visit the social every day 
Every time be turned away 
Every time be turned away 
She'd feel alone in a crowded room 

Cry when she heard a happy tune 
Julie waits, her world is her window 
And Julie hates, she hates the world below 
A hundred stairs to her new room 

Over glass and blackened spoons 
Children grow old so soon
Past the kids who gather there 
Pain masked by narcotic stares 

But no one really cares 
Her dreams were cut up and bled dry 
A million voices in her cry 
Julie waits, her world is her window 

And Julie hates, she hates the world below 
And Julie hates, just what she doesn't know 
But Julie loves, 
She loves too much to know",Julie,1994
The Levellers,"When Johnny comes marching home again, hurah tada
He's coming by bus or underground, hurah tada
The world no doubt will shed a tear to see his face so beaten in fear
And it's just around the corner in the English civil war

Still at the stage of clubs and fists, hurah tada
When that well known face got beaten to bits, hurah tada
Your face was blue in the light of the screen
As we watched the speech of an animal scream
The new party army was marching right over our heads

There you are, ha ha, I told you so, hurah tada
Says everybody that we know, hurah tada
But who hid the radio under the stairs
And who got caught out on their unawares
When that new party army came marching right up the stairs

When Johnny comes marching home again, hurah tada
Nobody understands this can happen again, hurah tada
The sun is shining and the kids are shouting loud
But you've got to know it's shining through a crack in the cloud
And the shadows keep on falling when Johnny comes marching home

All the girls go oh get his coffin ready
'Cause Johnny's coming home

The Levellers,"The life that I have chosen
And there will be content
And the salt sea shall be frozen
Before that I repent

Repent I shall not ever
Until the day I die
For the lowlands of Holland
Have claimed my destiny

I look out onto the rolling sea
But there'll be no easy ride
It's enough to break your mind and will
There's many times we've tried

We cried together but we fought
We staked all to be free
For the lowlands of Holland
Have claimed my destiny

So you feel the wind in your hair
As we leave the old country
With seven score friends, here by our side
To keep us company

And some we'll never see

Have claimed my destiny

""Please ... at least leave us alone in our living room.""

Do you wake up screaming shouting in the dark

And handed you the tools 
To burn it down

Lies there for you to climb
Higher and higher

Know this is cold

Tall shadows will hold 
The ground you loved
To you is broken
Taken from you

Got a shopping bag with your life in 
Your old man's going through the bins
It's down and outs on Hope Street

Rain on me come pouring down 
Clean the dirt off this old town 
Tell the sun to come around
And show his face on Hope Street

There's a fight right down the street

Blew his money for the week
On a horse called Hope Street 

No old faces out today 
Someone took them all away
Cleaning up or so they say 
The dirty face of Hope Street

Dressed up in your ties of blue
Saying there's not much you can do 
To help the kids on Hope Street

Seems almost a part of it these days

The world keeps turning 'round
The only thing that keeps me here is you' 
I'm drinking in the same bar where I met you 
Without you it wouldn't be the same
We talk for hours and hours 'bout different places 
You said that you would see them all some day 

You were always so good with words
The tales you told we've heard
The thing you said to me that day 
Will never fade in memory 
Time is unforgiving
You know that I won't make it without you

But her price was not gold 
She cired more than most 
When her story was told 
But her people were evil
Left her baron and cold 
And her heart went to market
Where her body was sold

So many killers gonna take you away

But in amongst the city lights 
The feeling's not so clean

And you don't live in fear of it

You can dance in the dawn

If drinking for the nation
Is getting you down
'Cause it takes a lot of work

And eating dirt
It takes a lot of cash
And a lot of life to get this trash

You tie it straight to the mouth
But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth

Don't fall under temptation
If drinking for the nation
Is dragging you down
Your country needs you don't deny it

Drink all you can just don't get high
And if you feel it start to hurt
Just buy another
Say let's get worse

But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth
But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth

Don't fall under temptation
If drinking for the nation is getting you down
'Cause every penny that you spend
Goes to defend, the one you love

No, it's not mine if you haven't a drink
No pain no gain, hand in glove

Don't ever think if thinking brings you down
Don't ever think if thinking brings you down

The Levellers,"Down the hill I wander,
Just to watch the world go by.
Passers by pass under,
Underneath the clear blue sky.
No-one seems to notice,
No-one seems to even wonder why.
And as I sit I sail away,
It is as if I broke the line.
Cause nothing really matters,
Nothing matters all the time.
But no-one seems to notice,
No-one seems to even wonder why.
",Sail Away,1997
The Levellers,"In the life in front of you and me
Seems there is no logic, no place that you must be
And there are times that it gets so hard to see

To find the valid reasons for the things that come to be
But you must try to set your spirit free
You know you cannot hide from spiritual disease
And it seems you cannot please the present company

Who could claim to know the answers
Is just the way we're meant to be
Love is stronger in survivors
Survivors follow destiny

If you like we could go down to the sea
We could watch the evening tide, catch the boat to Honalee
We could fly above the dark city

Gettin' higher in the sky with every breath you breathe
And if you cry about the things you leave
It's yourself you should be asking, about what you really need
And you know it is no lie for it only takes belief

If you like we could go down to the sea
We could watch the evening tide, catch the boat to Honalee
We could fly above the dark city

Gettin' higher in the sky with every breath you breathe

And you know it is no lie for it only takes belief

The Levellers,"Here she comes, the great leveller
King and serfs bow before her
If you feel her eyes on you - run
She'll come and put her arms around you
You lie and say she hasn't found you
You'll run to her she's there to greet you
Are you lost to us forever
Tied in lust strapped in leather
Is the cost way beyond you
Do you love her more than you love yourself

[Chorus]
Is it just too real
Cold clear for you to feel
Is it just too real
Cold clear for you to feel

Am I far in the distance
Am I the cure or a symptom
Should I go when you tell me to
Can you tell I've never loved her
Because my life is for another
Who's up and down
But will take me there
I don't claim to understand her
But hand in hand I am with her
Bright and clear and with a future
You can come and join us if you dare
I sing, but you can't speak
I laugh, but you can't smile

The Levellers,"When I dream, I get pictures of the world I've never seen
I'm playing parts upon the silver screen
I'm anything my dream wants me to be
The picture always ends with you and me

There are times that you need to look a little deeper down inside
You might not always like the things you find
You may find you're running out of time
But the truth is always there for you to find

There's an angel watching over me
We've got angels, the kind that
Burns and I can't see
There's an angel watching over me

When the nightmares come
And the hounds of hunt surround me
When the thick comes on
Let the devil sends his dogs to find me

The Levellers,"Everybody knows the story
They've got the details, what the score is
But if you want the truth, girl
You may need more than a day

You need to move just a little closer
These walls have ears if you didn't know, girl
There're certain things that you need to know
Before you go on your way

It seems the world is a little busy
Selling lies on for a living
That in a blinking of an eye
The truth has slipped away

And the writings on the wall
To see

It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never easy, never kind
It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never one to mind

Moving on to the next installment
(In)
Case the bar room jury dies of boredom
The vultures are waiting
For the next meal of the day

Another tale that's sad and sorry
And another love that went so wrong
And all the inside guts and glory
That pushed it all along

It's hard to find the word to say
You just let the days go by, come what may
All the things that we should have done
Just happened anyway

And the writing written on the wall
For everyone to see

It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never easy, never kind
It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never one to mind

It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never easy, never kind
It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never one to mind

And that's your own

My father when I was younger
Took me up on to the hill
That looked down on the city smog
Above the factory spill
He said this is where I come
When I want to be free
Well he never was in his lifetime
But these words stuck with me

I ran from all of this
And I climbed that highest hill
And looked down on my life
Above the factory spill
I looked down onto my life
As the family disgrace
Then to all my friends on the starting line
Their wages off to chase
and all my friends and all their jobs
And all the bloody waste

I grew up, learned to love and laugh
Circled A's on the underpass
But the noise we thought would never stop
Died a death as the punks grew up
And we choked on our dreams
We wrestled with our fears 
Running through the heartless concrete streets
Chasing our ideas

And the problems of the world
Won't be solved by this guitar
And they won't stop coming either 
By the life I've had so far
And the bright lights of my home town
Won't be getting any dimmer 
Though their calling has receded now
Like some old distant singer
And they don't seem so appealing
To the eyes of this poor sinner

Just don't panic 'cause I'm holding your life belt
Or I'll just stand and watch
Yes, I'll just stand and watch

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, so long

You were never meant to be
When you first put out to sea

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, so long

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, it's goodbye
So long, it's goodbye

The Levellers,"You were born out of one
But you were made as two
You were made to go on
You've forgotten what to do

So wake up now I'm begging you
You sleep and sleep on
It's all you ever do
Has your comfort now gone

When you look around the room
And remember the fire, the fire in you
The sleeping excuse that's all you ever do
And it's really no use

When there's so much left for us to do
Can you make some time
For what is always yours and mine
I've seen you cutting loose

I've seen you stretched out on the line
Try and remember the truth
Without you we're all no use
Wake up, my friend
