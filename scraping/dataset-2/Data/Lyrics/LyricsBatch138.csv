Devo,"You got your left hand
You got your right hand
You got your left hand
You got your right hand

While the left hand diddling
While the right hand goes to work
I said the left hand diddling now
While the right hand go to work

You got both hands
You got both hands
You got praying hands
You got praying hands

They pray for no man
They pray for no man
Okay relax, and assume the position
Go into doggie submission

Wash your hands three times a day
Always do what your mom and dad say
Brush your teeth in the following way
Wash your hands three times a day

You got your left hand
You got your right hand
You got your left hand
You got your right hand

While the left hand diddling
While the right hand goes to work
I said the left hand diddling, oh
While the right hand go to work

You got both hands
You got both hands
You got praying hands
You got praying hands

They pray for no man
They pray for no man

Roll over, play dead
Get spiritual minded
Okay relax, and assume the position
Go into doggie submission

Wash your hands three times a day
Always do what your mom and dad say
Brush your teeth in the following way
Wash your hands three times a day",Praying Hands [Live],1978
Devo,"Shrivel-up
Well it's a god-given fact (that
You can't go back)
It's a god-given law that

You're gonna lose your maw
It's a god-given fact you gotta
Buy'em by the sack
It's a god-given law that

You're gonna get small
May be just another rap but
You're running out of sap
Well you better take the rap

Dying under daddy's cap
It's at the top of the list
That you can't get pissed
It's rule number one living right isn't fun

Time-tested and true you
Gotta pooty poo-poo",Shrivel-Up [Live],1978
Devo,"Well she was walking all alone
Down the street in the alley
Her name was Sally
I never touched her, she never saw it

When she was hit by space junk
When she was hit by space junk
When she was hit by space junk

""In New York, Miami beach
Heavy metal fell in Cuba
Angola, Saudi Arabia
On Christmas eve"", said Norad

A soviet sputnik hit Africa
India, Venezuela, in Texas, Kansas
It's falling fast Peru too
It keeps coming, it keeps coming, it keeps coming

And now I'm mad about space junk
I'm all burned out about space junk
Walk and talk about space junk
It smashed my baby's head, space junk
And now my sally's dead, space junk",Space Junk [Live],1978
Devo,"Think I got your dial tone
Think I got Billy Baxter's bone
Think I got a bubble-sac
I think I got a big mac attack

Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce
Special orders, don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
Serve it your way

There's too much paranoias
There's too much paranoias
My momma's afraid to tell me
The things she's afraid of

I been dipped in double meaning
I been stuck with static cling
Think I got a rupto-pac
I think I got a big mac attack

Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce
Special orders, don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
Serve it your way

Devo,"Gotta nervous kind of feeling 
Gotta painful yellow headache 
Every picture in every magazine's 
Come real 

Every face looks out 
And screams at me too real
Cold sweat on my collar 
Dripping to my boots 

The waves of nauseous pain 
Sets off the pressure pad alarms 
Gotta get outta here 
Gotta get outta here 
Gotta get outta here 
Gona get outta here
Gotta painful swelling brain 

Banging in my head 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
And I called off sick 
Gotta swelling itching pain 
Got me pulling out my hair 
Gotta swelling itching pain 

Clutching at my brain
Gotta painful swelling brain 
In the back of my head 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
And I called off sick
Gotta swelling itching pain 
Got me pulling out my hair 
Gotta swelling itching pain 

Clutching at my brain
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Got me laying in the floor 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Think I left my senses 
Gotta swelling itching pain 
Seems like endless torture 
Gotta swelling itching pain 

Banging in my head
Gotta painful swelling brain 
In the back of my head 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
And I called off sick
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Got me pulling out my hair 
Gotta painful swelling brain 

Clutching at my brain 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Painful swelling brain 
Driving me up the wall 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Painful swelling brain 

Gripping at my eyes 
Ears, nose and mouth 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Painful swelling brain 
It's bloating my thoughts 

Gotta painful swelling brain 
Painful swelling brain 
Leaves me holding the front door now 
Gotta swelling itching pain 
Swelling itching pain 

Clutching at my brain 
Gotta painful swelling brain 
Painful swelling brain 
Got me lying on the floor 
Gotta painful swelling brain

Painful swelling brain 
Going out of my skull 
Gotta painful swelling brain

Devo,"Jonee went to the pawnshop
Bought himself a guitar
Now he's gonna go far
You gotta love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes you deceive 'em
You made her cry
Jonee you're bad
You're gonna make her sad
Jonee jumped in his datsun
Drove out on the expressway
Went head-on into a semi
His guitar is all that's left now
He made her cry
Now she calls his name
Jonee you're to blame",Come Back Jonee [Version],1979
Devo,"Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back
When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it

Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good

When a good time turns around
You must whip it
You will never live it down
Unless you whip it
No one gets away
Until they whip it

I say whip it
Whip it good
I say whip it
Whip it good

Crack that whip
Give the past the slip

Devo,"Twist away the gates of steel 
Unlock the secret voice 
Give in to ancient noise 
Take a chance a brand new dance 
Twist away the gates of steel 

Twist away, now twist and shout 
The earth it moves too slow 
But the earth is all we know 
We pay to play the human way 
Twist away the gates of steel 

A man is real 
Not made of steel 

But the earth is all we know 
We pay to play the human way 
Twist away the gates of steel 

The beginning was the end 
Of everything now 
The ape regards his tail 
He's stuck on it 
Repeats until he fails 
Half a goon and half a god 
A man's not made of steel 

Twist away, now twist and shout 
The earth it moves too slow 
But the earth is all we know 
We pay to play the human way 
Twist away the gates of steel 

A man is real that's how he feels",Gates of Steel [Live],1980
Devo,"I, I owe owe you 
Absolutely nothing 
I, I know know you 
Positively disagree 
I've heard it said that all is fair 
In love and war so what's life for 
You watch it go out the window 
Stop and go back for more 
More!

Go, go fight fight, punch 
Your way to happiness 
Go, go light light, or 
You'll never be a big success 

I heard it said that all is fair 
In love and war so what's life for 
The boy and girl 
Two separate worlds 
The endless tug of war

Devo,"Every move I make 
Every rule I break 
Makes me want it more 
Every step I take 
Every new mistake 
Each revolving door 
Keeps me searching for you 
There's nowhere for you to hide 
'Cause a feelin's got me reelin' 
And I'm twisted up inside 

Don't you know I got a thing that looks for you 
Don't you know the way you make me feel about you 
Don't you know I got a place that waits for you 
Don't you know that I'm always thinking of you 

I got a rocket in my pocket 
But I don't know what to do 
Like a plug without a socket 
I'm just waitin' 'round for you 

Don't you know I got a thing for you

Devo,"Baby, baby, baby hurt me bad 
Baby, baby 
Baby, baby made me cry 
Baby, I want to die 

Somebody tell me where she's hiding out 
I gotta find that cheatin' gal 
Can't go, can't go, can't go sleep at night 
Can't sleep, can't sleep 
It's not right 

Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes 
Sunlight, makes me rise 
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over 
I gotta hear it face to face 
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around like you're in a big game 
I'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you 
Boo hoo 

Baby, baby, baby please come back 
Baby, baby 
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes

I can't sleep until my baby says it's over 
I gotta hear it face to face 
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around like you're in a big game 
I shoot around in a trance all day and think about you 
All the time 

I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around like you're in a big game 
It's so unfair that you're so happy when I'm hurtin' inside

Devo,"Three cheers!
They're yellin' again
Three cheers!
They'll be at it to the end

So drink some big beers and go crazy tonight
They're all dressed up and they'll be gettin' it tonight
Big swingers in double knits tonight
Big babies gonna get in a fight
Actin' crazy, bustin' up the chairs
Doubled over gettin' sick on the stairs

They know the limits 'cause they cross them every night
The dull sensations as it turns real hot
Why, the guys in the back with their heads on the floor
Surrounded by their buddies, they're all hollerin' for more
Whoa, whoa, whoa
It's Mr. B's ballroom

Party time, turn the music up loud
Party time, lose your head in the crowd
Yellin',, laughin' tryin' hard to act smart
Put 'em under pressure and you watch them fall apart

Freeze! Come on out of there
Freeze! You ain't goin' nowhere
Freeze! Put your hands on your head
Freeze!

Devo,"My baby took our love 
And then she rolled it up 
Rolled it up a hill 
Like a ball of snow 
Like a snowball grows 
Until it gets too big 
Until she lost control 
And it rolled back down [Repeat: x3]

She took a tiny bit 
And rolled it up again 
Slower than before 
She went a step too far 
She had to let it go 
I saw it go straight down 
My baby turned around 
Started up again [Repeat: x3]

Eyes were made for looking' 
Hands were made for holdin' 
Hearts were made for lovin' 
Lips were made for kissin' 
Legs were made for walkin' 
Tracks were made to follow 
That's what I'm gonna do 

Two tracks 
In the snow 
Two tracks 
Up that hill 
My heart broke 
When my baby left 
Two tracks behind",Snowball,1980
Devo,"Vigor, vim, vitality and punch 
The ability to act on a sudden hunch 
Nerve to tackle the hardest thing 
Feet that climb and hands that cling 
A heart that never forgets to sing 
That's pep [Repeat: x3]

Sand and grit in a concrete base 
A friendly smile on an honest face 
A spirit that helps when another's down 
Knows how to scatter the blackest frown 
Love's it's neighbor, love's it's town 
That's pep [Repeat: x4]

Say ""I will"", for you know you can 
Look for the best in every man 
Meet each thundering knockout blow 
Come back with a smile 'cause you know 
You get the best of the whole damn show 
That's pep [Repeat: x6]

You know that's pep",That's Pep!,1980
Devo,"When love takes a back seat to life 
When a man runs away from his wife 
That's when you know 
He's in the world 

When a guy tries to round up his mate 
But she's gone and it's gettin' too late 
That's when you know 
He lost his girl 

[Chorus]
So it happens 
All the time 
Don't get low 
Just stand in line 
Take your turn 
Now make your move 
And crush that doubt 
With a ton o' love

When woman takes a back seat to man 
She has to tell him where to go if she can 
And she decides 
To wear his ring

Find a girl with the face of a clock 
Hands move forward 'til you can't stop 
She comes from above 
With a ton o' love [Repeat: x12]",Ton O' Luv,1980
Devo,"Be stiff be - abies be stiff
Fruit ooze is wetly lewd
Stay dry in rubber boots and
Cucumbers ripe and rude
Bend over fixed to shoot and
Breath hard in metal suits
Live right make lots of loot
Wet women waste your food
Go solo no no two's and
Deep sleepers jerk the root
Watch out for fruits and mutes and",Be Stiff,1981
Devo,"She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of the greenest tree
She sends out an aroma of undefined love
It drips on down in a mist from above

[Chorus]
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

You hear her calling everywhere you turn
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn
But the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue
She's the real thing but you knew it all along

Look at you with your mouth watering
Look at you with your mind spinnin'
Why don't we just admit it's all over
She's just the girl you want

Devo,"I heard a girl in a dress
Say her face was a mess
I heard there's no reason why
I heard that now's the time to buy

On planet earth
I'll probably stay
On planet earth
It's a place to live your life

Where pleasure follows pain
People go insane
Fly around in planes
Pray that it won't rain
Drive around in cars
Get drunk in local bars
Dream of being stars
Well I lived all my life on planet earth

I saw a girl lose all control
When she lost her new mink stole
I saw her try to catch a man
Things I couldn't understand

People go insane

Pray that it won't rain
Drive around in cars
Get drunk in local bars
Dream of being stars
Well I lived all my life on planet earth

I saw a man on a stage
Scream put me back in my cage
I saw him hang by his tie
I saw enough to make me cry

Devo,"This is the boy who burns the books
This is the way he always looks
This is the boy who smashed his car
This is the boy who went too far

Washed his eyes with yellow soap
He stole his daddy's microscope
All alone or in a crowd
Never say his name aloud

Now he wants to know your unit's name
Where you go and whence you came
He's the mecha-mania boy
This is the boy who never goes slow

He is the one who destroys his young
(Oh no everybody got a new way to go)
All alone or on the telephone
He knows the time you spend at home

(Oh no never say I didn't tell you so)
Washed his hands of his daddy's fate
He put himself in an alternate state
In a crowd or all alone

No one's laughing anymore",Mecha-Mania Boy [*],1981
Devo,"Greetings beautiful mutants
And how may we be of service?
This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated
Checking in with the many factions

Of devolutionary humans
Who have waited so faithfully this past year
While Devo gathered its strength
For the next offensive

As many of you can see
The road ahead is filled with danger
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear
But the human mind itself

Or lack of it on this planet
It's time to go beyond the normal thing
It's time to do the super thing
It's time for Devo

There is no question about it
The spud boys are ready with
New songs, new films and new approaches
To survival, in a world filled with subhumans

Lies, lies, lies
That's all we get
From those who pretend to know but don't
But once again Devo attempts

To cut through the mental grease and grime
With techniques of positive mutation
Designed to protect you
From the ninnies and the twits

Remember, no one knows
So let's find out, Devo asks the questions
That help point us all in the right direction
To go forward, move ahead

And give the past the slip
It's time to seek out new traditions
We know where the old one's took us
And now we are all here together

So let's go take in the full measure
Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit
The vinyl record and cassette tape
Of Devo's latest musical outpourings

Is entitled simply 'New traditionalists'
To purchase, it is not like spending money
But rather, it is an investment in the future
In a blow against the empire

This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated saying
'Bombs away'",Nu-Tra Speaks (New Traditionalist Man) [*],1981
Devo,"I've been walking in a deep sleep;
Sleepwalking, but I just woke up
From a deep sleep.
A very deep sleep.
I've been running on remote control,
In a deep sleep.
I awoke the moment I was told
That a smile is just a frown turned around,
On the face of a clown with a mean streak.

It was a deep sleep,
A very deep sleep.
I can't remember what I used to know.
Somebody help me now and let me go.
Into a deep sleep.

Push me back, now let me go
Into a dream again.
To a sleep unlike before,
So deep it never ends.

I've been caught inside a deep sleep,
Sinking deeper after I forgot.
Sleepwalking, as I watch myself,
In a deep sleep.
I keep pretending that it's someone else.",Deep Sleep,1982
Devo,"We like explosions that leave you feeling good
We like ideas that change the world for good

There's nothing past the stop 'n' go
There's nothing but the ebb and flow
There's nothing like some in and out
There's nothing more than what you know

We like new places that jets can't take you to
We do like music when it does what it should do

Yes oh yeah
Yes oh yeah
Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)
Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)

We like explosions it's only right we should

We like new places until they're overrun
We do like music, loud shots from the big spudgun",Explosions,1982
Devo,"I desire I desire
I pledge allegiance to the thought
That your love is all that matters
And your gestures have the power
To bring the whole world to its knees

Don't let me torment you
Don't let me bring you down
Don't ever let me hurt you
Don't let me fail because

I desire your attention
I desire your perfect love
I desire nothing more (than this)

To give you happiness
Could become a lifetime goal
A smile I might bring you
Is more important than world peace

That you're wise to walk away
For nothing is more dangerous
Than desire when it's wrong",I Desire,1982
Devo,"She's out of sync 
And everyone around her 
Knows that something is wrong 
She's out of sync 
She's got all the symptoms 
Of a girl who skipped a beat 
She's out of sync 
A piece of ancient history 
She's a walking mirage 

She's out of sync 
She entered through the exit 
And never stopped to think 
She's out of sync she's a half 
Step behind 
She's out of luck her body split from 
Her mind 
She's out of orbit she'll never connect 
She'll run out of time before she

There s a distance to keep

To living in a dark age 
She's out of sync 
Constantly undoing 
What's already been done 
She's out of sync

Devo,"Patterns all around you
Patterns everywhere
Patterns of behavior
Sometimes seem unfair
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

Patterns unfamiliar
Patterns lead you through (to)
Patterns of discovery
Tracing out the clues
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?
Stuck in your mind

In this land where stability is hard to find
You can rearrange the patterns so unkind
Don't bother asking why a pattern never cries
Old patterns never die they just go on and on

Patterns multiplying
Re-direct our view
Endless variations
Make it all seem new",Patterns,1982

Of things that don't make sense

Now I must do what I must
Now why do you think that a man
Jumps out of the frying pan
Into the fire when he can

Find a way not to get burned?
I must do what I must do
And I do though I know better
I must do what I must do
(Even though he's gonna get it)

Below the sky above
Beyond what's good and true
Some thing as loud as love
Calls out I can't refuse

I must do what I must do
And I do though I know better
I must do what I must do
(Even though he might regret it)
",What I Must Do,1982

At the drop of the hat or a bomb
When someone's screaming it's hard to ignore
Like the shot of a gun, c'mon

The party never ends
Let's run till there's no way

Can't you hear them call
Can't you see the lasers probing
Brighter than the sun, let's run

Can't you hear them call
Can't you see those lasers probing

Not to find out what's going on
When something's funny there's a feeling you get
It's the grip of a threat, c'mon

The party never ends
Let's run till there's no way
To go on, c'mon

That we are here to go
We are here to go

Where does he draw the line

Go on and step across
Just remind yourself
That we are here to go

The hand that bites gets fed
Troubled multiply

When the odds are no win
Head for the nearest door

Enoughs not enough
When love gets rough
The jurisdiction of love

Off their walls
Just like Niagara Falls

Is no comfort
It only makes the
Matter seem worse

Might equals right
In connubial fight

Love equals war
I don't like it no more

Don't treat me like a fool

Love comes in spurts
Sometimes it gets to be
Too much to rise above
If you love me
You would leave me
Leave me time to be alone

Please believe me
That would leave me
Time to love you

Does that strike you funny love?

Becomes another empty cup of memories

Its sweet deep inside
Its real and its better

They like to take it away

Got a message from my girl
When she picked up a pen from beside her bed
And wrote me a scribbled note

Said she'd be coming back to see me
That she would be visiting real soon
Gonna get up from her long white bed
And leave this cold white room

We would once more live together
Go out on a lovin' spree
Just like before the accident
My baby would look at me

I saw her sweet face trembling
As she tried to open her eyes
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy
The day my baby gave me a surprise

Devo,"Love without anger
He picked up the phone and took the call
A long distance voice just started to bawl
I don't care if you feel small

Love without anger isn't love at all
Why can't you have your cake and eat it too
Why believe in things that make it tough on you
Why scream and cry when you know it's through

Why fall in love when there's better things to do
Barbie and ken in a great big fight
Seems ken forgot to make it home one night
You know what you are seeing simply can't be right

Looks like love's bark is worse than its bite
He was young and in love
So he just couldn't see
And it compelled him to ask

Are you kidding me?
You must be kidding me!

Young alien types who step out

And dare to declare
Spank the pank who try to drive you nuts

Devon,"I'm so perfect you say
I'm so special, no one can compare
How can you see all these things in me?
I can't believe you

I'm looking in my funhouse mirror
I'm disgusted by what I see
I strain to catch a glimpse of the light
You claim to see around me

And the more I try to run away
The more you pull me back
And the more you try to love me
The more that I attack
I just can't see what you see in me


You want to destroy self-portraits that I paint
Through picasso's eyes
But it's hard to discard
Weapons that I use
In my daily self-destruction

And the more I try to run away
The more you pull me back
And the more you try to love me
The more that I attack
I just can't see what you see in me


I'm sitting on the corner of paranoid and hopelessness
Waiting, waiting
For you to take me away
I'm always trying to get rid of you
When what I really want
Is for you to stay

And the more I try to run away
The more you pull me back
And the more you try to love me
The more that I attack
I just can't see what you see in me


I want to see what you see
I wish I could see what you see
In me

Devon Allman,"I was standing by my window
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting

Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost

What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out ""fuck that!""
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let’s do it all, have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything then you have bliss
Then she told me this

Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost

Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs, take 10 shots tonight
Awesome I’m naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace I don't mean Danny Granger
Can’t wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
""Let's do this right now"" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text

Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost

That's that endless summer, never going back to school
We do what we want to, can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town, going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

Take me down
Take me all the way down, soon I'll be leaving",Let's Get Lost,2014

Look what I turned out to be
I wonder if my mama really means it when she says that she's proud of me
Or is she tripping, is she lying
Is she on to all my lies? Mean that shit ain't rocket science
I've been coming home at four, and my eyes been red as sirens
I miss slurring all my words when she asked me how my night went
I swear it's them white boys, it's them white boys
Everything they do is so much doper than my life been
I don't got that type of money, I don't got that finance
She's like, why you so lazy trying to get by
Back before I smoked, I wasn't even tryna get high
Cigarette breaks at lunch time
Bong rips to my face, I passed out at Dave's place
In the morning tryna get right

Coming through the spot, always see you with your sleeves rolled up
Even with a uniform
I could never do the norm
How could I forget? I be on some shit

With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,
For a thousand years.
The hills fill my heart,
With the sound of music.
My heart wants to sing every song it hears.

My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely.
I know I will hear
What I heard before.
My heart will be blessed

Show me that you’re listening and tear this devil out of me

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Dexter Gordon,"Temper is a package
Pulling at its bow
Darling disasters
Help you grow

Panthers build their blood to bury
Daughters leave their dads to marry

Hide in the weeds
The orchestra
Is proving death again

Temper is the warp
Speed of red flashes
And all the bells ringing
God forbid, God forbid

Did I catch you in the flashes?
Did I catch you in the flashes?

Hide with me
In the weeds
I'm proving death

Alive in the weeds
The orchestra
Is proving death

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

On the silver screen
Platinum reflection
In a movie magazine
Well, did you ever
Have a headache
Did your mama own a gramaphone
Did you like to be an actress
Were you scared
To be alone

We never stop to wonder
Till a person's gone
We never yearn
To know him
Till he's traveled on
When someone is around us
We don't know what we're seeing
We take a Polaroid picture
To find the human being
We never stop to wonder
Till a person's gone
We never yearn
To know him
Till he's packed
And traveled on

Sweet beautiful Jesus
On a painted cross
Polystyrene body
With a superficial gloss
Hey, were you
Jealous of your father
Were you short
When you were fully grown
Did you like to walk on water
Were you scared
To be alone

I think perhaps tomorrow
I'll try to make a friend
To really get
To know him
Instead of pretend
I'll ask him if his feet hurt
Has he burdens to be shared
And if he doesn't walk away
I'll ask him
If he's scared
And if he doesn't walk away
If his eyes don't
Turn to stone
I'll ask him
If he's scared
To be alone",Scared to Be Alone,2004
Dexter Gordon,"Love locked out in all the cold and rain,
Love locked out may never come again.
Love locked out and weeping bitter tears,
No-one ever hears him calling.

No-one needs the precious gift he brings,
No-one heeds the song of love he sings,
On the door he beats his tiny wings,
Just love locked out.

A world without love is a world without life,
A sad world full of gloom,
So see there's a place for love in your heart,
Why, he doesn't need much room.

Love is well worth the waiting for,
When he comes knocking at your door,
Fling it wide open, for love locked out
Will come no more, no more.

Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
Niggaz straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law
Stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
For a taste of it, the chick strip, clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams

[Chorus: Dexter Wiggles (RZA)]
If real niggaz is listening, the life we living in, is wrong
(Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable, Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable)
Back for transitions, to save us from harm
We in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind
But if we run the race like a thug
We would lose that mind that we made of

[RZA]
You kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
Liable to pull a knife from out of his heal
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand
You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
One man, can't uplift the land
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant
Splendid, unprecidented, hip hop vintage
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us
He was God Cypher Divine, trying to spark the wizzes

need to ask you. If youre so anti-fashion, why not wear flares, instead of 
dressing down all the same. Its just that looking like that I can express 
my dissatisfaction.

Let me explain, though youd never see in a million years. Keep quoting 
Cabaret, Berlin, Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, Duchamp, Beauvoir, Kerouac, 
Kierkegaard, Michael Rennie. I dont believe you really like Frank Sinatra. 

Dear Robin 
Youre always so happy, how the hell do you get your inspiration? Youre 
like a dumb patriot. If youre supposed to be so angry, why dont you fight 
and let me benefit from your right? Dont you know the only way to change 
things is to shoot men who arrange things, Dear Robin 
I would explain but youd never see in a million years. Well, youve made 
your rules, but we dont know that game, perhaps Id listen to your records 
but your logics far too lame and Id only waste three valuable minutes of 
my life with your insincerity.

I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow.
Hollow sorrow's nothing new.
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
Until I believe in my soul.

Despite all this trickery you told me was right.
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?

(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between 
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.

Dexys Midnight Runners,"I'll show you them now, those boys without cares.
Who'd swapped dirty pictures and talked during prayers.
They grew up with wisdom they'd stored from ""those days""
Nobody told them to get in they must change.
I'll show you them now. Come with me and
I'll show you them now.
The teachers laughed with them class idiot style.
After all they weren't their kids so why should they mind.
Boyish good looks held the wrath back a while.
Then they were drummed in and thumped in and soon left behind.
Alcoholics, child molesters, nervous wrecks and prima donnas
Jilted lovers, office clerks, petty thieves, hard drug pursuers.
Lonely tramps, awkward misfits, oh anyone of these.
Mortgaged up families looked at first too mundane.
But it's funny how with help all the lucky ones changed.
Some of them couldn't, there had to be more.
Music, I dunno, films, something special perhaps.
I'll show you them now, come with me
And I'll show you them now.
It's so hard to picture dirty tramps as young boys.
But if you see a man crying, hold his hand, he's my friend.
If these words sound corny, switch this off, I don't care.
Nearby he's still crying, I won't smile while he's there.
Nearby he's still crying. I won't smile while he's there.

You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Yeah, I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question

Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do

I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

Our life from day to day
Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question

Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play?
Show up on my doorstep
With a bouquet
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say, baby, I love you
Like you used to?

I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah)
I think about it everyday (everyday)
And even though we've moved on (moved on, uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (Walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me, my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose the love that was meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her, and wish that it was you that I'm kissin'
Sometimes I miss him, and wish that it was you that I'm missin'
Sometimes I hug her, and wish that it was you that I'm huggin'
And I realized how much I'm buggin'
I miss you

So how do I express this feeling?
'Cause nobody compares to you
And you know that she'll never love you like I do

(Yeah) I can't explain this feeling (uh huh)
I think about it everyday (everyday, yeah)
And even though we've moved on (yeah)

Que me está partiendo en dos la razón
Qué voy a hacer sin su amor
Qué voy a hacer con mi amor

Se alejó de mi vida, de un solo golpe
Se fue sin decirme adiós
Me rompió la sonrisa, las ilusiones

Pero no le bastó, no fue suficiente
No quiso quererme como la quise yo

Que no cabe en mi pecho
Que me cala los huesos
Que se ahoga en este mar de dolor

Siento que me muero de pensar que nunca volverás 
Tengo que aprender a resignarme 
A vivir sin ti desde este instante 
Un te quiero que me nace 
Yo te grito sin pensar 
Solo un beso antes de que te marches 
Un abrazo eterno como antes 
Y despumes pañuelos blancos al amor que dejaras 

No voy a llorar 
Aunque me muera de soledad 
Cuando me coma el dolor 
Al saber que tu adiós me lastima 
Por que te amo y me dejas hoy 
No voy a llorar 
Pondré cadena a mis lagrimas 
Y tratare de soñar de volver a empezar 
Aunque sigas muy clavada en mi corazon 

Entre las sombras solo un cigarrillo queda ya 
Pero mi penumbra es saber que alguien te amara 
Tengo que aprender a resignarme

Dezeray's Hammer,"She was with me
I was lonely 
I guess I'm always on my own 
Her words were cutting 
But she said nothing 
I'm always racing against myself 

Words they don't come so easily

Who's standing the shadows 
It really doesn't matter anyway, anyway now

And I know I won't be praying 
I know I won't be praying anymore 
So if you thought I might be praying 
And I know I won't be praying 
I know I won't be praying anymore 

I was living, living with her beside me 
Not knowing where she was 
She was living in a world of silence (I won't lead you down) 
Just to bring about a course of violence (I won't lead you down) 
And she was moving towards moving on (I won't lead you down) 
It took the longest time to say 
You took everything from me 

There was a thought a might be praying 
And I know I won't be praying 
I know I won't be praying anymore 
So if you thought I might be praying

Dezi Hayes,"See the searching...
See the people...
Out in the darkness and soul searching
Did you find what we had lost?

All this time I've got to thinking about the promises;
How long this energy of Winter?
How many times that we could never love?
How many times is time enough?

All the foolish notions: When we'll die that's all that is.
We can never really understand the broken promises.
All along we run together (Remember?)
All along we run as one (Remember?)

When you find a perfect union, you've got to follow it.
Stop that reasoning (you've got the answer)
Stop that thinking out loud! (you've got the answer)
Go where your heart takes you to (you've got the answer!)

You're not that innocent! You've been around!
You're not that innocent...
Got to be right; got it coming to you.
How many times is time enough? (Time enough...)

Your time is just beginning out of all where we came from.

Holding on, Can you remember
Holding on, Was it ever like this?

DF Dub,"Oh yea
I'll tell ya a story
About a country girl
Oh yea

She was a country girl from Cleveland, Texas
In a big city and she liked my necklace (Bling Bling)
So we started talking, while we took a ride
In thee big pick-up truck and my hat was to the side (Oh yea)
She was a country girl, from the class of '96 ('96)
A big booty with some big ole country (damn)
A country name with some country attitude
Say yes Mam, but at times she's kinda rude
A daddy's girl, so I had to watch my ass
Sixteen, Mr. Hill would whoop my ass
He can't kick it, I'm a city kid
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did (we did)
Oh yea

I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world

She liked country living and acoustic guitars
And Kenny Chesney in country bars
And Cadillacs and I couldn't relate
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date
And her dad hated me, I knew it
Didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears and black music
We still chill cow tipping and tripping
With that brushed papa shirt lift back 'cause she was tipping (Oh yea)
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin' (Hmm)
Ain't used to my style big limos and clubbin' (We be clubbin')
A city kid and I'm doing my thang
I like an ole country girl and this is how I sang
Yee-hoo, What, What

I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world

Oh yea

A country girl cut off jeans and lollipops
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops
A country girl with them country ways
Livin' big city nights but them country days (Ugh)
A country girl don't understand thuggin' (What)
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin'
A country girl pigtails and care free
No direct dish, just Channel 3 (Oh, wait a minute)

This the only channel you have?
What?
Oh yea!

Pass the bottle 'cause I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle 'cause I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

[Verse 1]
Forget about love I like thongs and tattoos
Peggy Sues and boots, high heel stiletto shoes
I don't miss my ex, I like JB & Crown
I hit my boy scotch when that Jack ain't down
And no late night drama, no time to think
It's last call, 10 minutes, it's time to drink
I'm all smiles and hugs, Strip clubs I'm kinda twisted
It's 2 am and I'm still double fistin (you know)
You can have your man I got Britney and Hannah
A New York girl and one from Alabama
And you miss me now, but Kelly's on my mind
Oh I might call Heather just to pass the time
You didn't like my ways so now I'm livin it up
Totin up and showin up keep filling my cup
I may, I may not, say whatever you say
I got my cure right here I'm gonna drink you away

There's no worries tonight and no cares, so let's go
'cause I met a nice girl, I think her name was Tammy
I tipped her 20 bux, got to feel her fanny
For a good five minutes, thought it was true love
Til I realized I was in the elks club (what)
I'm single now so come sit on my lap
I got 5 more dollars in my baseball cap
I don't miss my girl now, hey baby where you goin?
She had thick thighs, half her ass was showin
It's just me and my bros in limos and live shows
Throwin them bows love comes and then it goes
And I told you, no bluffs, it's all true
Now it's Babydolls, Cheatas and Déjà vu
And my mind's over you more and more everyday
But in the meantime I'ma drink you away

Pass the bottle 'cause I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle 'cause I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

[Verse 3]
A city kid in a different world
But I fell outta love with that country girl
No headaches, heartbreaks, it's just drinks and bottles
I went from country girls to dating plus size models
(?????) cold brews, booty calls and malls
And big balls and big drawers in the bathroom stalls
And now I'm clubbin, lovin them girls with ass cracks
Lips waxed and girls with the damn the big racks
I'm done with you and it's back to straight gin
And I'm cussin you out with a half drunk grin
And I'm lovely 'cause it gets no better
I'm fully fueled up when I wrote this letter
I'm writing goodbyes, it's no ties and no lies
Blond hair and blue eyes, kiss my ass goodbye
I'm back to the bar 'cause my therapy's there
6 drinks later like I don't even care
'cause I

Your smell has got me shrinking

[Raekwon]
Snowy night, fiends basing
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers

[Ghostface Killah]
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down

I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...
You better kill me... you know you're booty...
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper ""A man who came to kill, gets knocked out""

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies... and you're so crazy
How tears of joy, bring so much life

[Method Man]
Yo aiyo yo yo yo
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hassling us
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up
Time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, it's cracking the spot

DHI,"Been low, at the breakdown. Collapsed, at the turn-around. 
All the time I can't forget - forgive, relieve. 
Heard all your dead end words (the rancid air). 
In a dream laced with ice, and tragedy. 

In a rage, how will it end? Burn on, away. 
Thrown back again. In a rage. 
Ran out, pushed against the ground. 
Spat out the foul. Hands shaking wild - am I losing myself? 

And not a scar, weak on the flesh. 
Time racing blind, sinking in sand. 
How will it end? In a rage.",Rage,1996

Di,"I wake up every morning to another crazy day I have to face 
And when I'm losing my direction 
You're the one who points me in the right way 
You always know when I'm about to fall 
It's like you're standing there when I hit that wall 
Cause of you my eyes are open 
And instead of always hoping 
I have faith today 

So thank you for blue skies 
When my head is down 
You remind me to look up 
And thank you for all those times 
You believed when others couldn't see 
Oh, without you where would I be? 

I should tell you in a letter 
All the things that I have never said 
Cause when you're right in front of me nothing ever comes out how I planned 
Like how the heart in you goes on for miles 
And when it passes through me I come alive 
If I ever learned a lesson 
It's in the first and lasting impression 
Of the way you got to me 

So thank you for blue skies 
When my head is down you remind me to look up 
And thank you for all those times 
You believed when others couldn't see 
Oh, without you where would I be? 
Where would I be?

Di Angelo Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Di Angelo Orchestra,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan

High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me",I Left My Heart in San Francisco,2000

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Di Scherling,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,1995

The coldness of war and the sweetness of love
Through evolution came our species
That still wander the path of the electric sun

The pain in my veins

All... they discovered the theme for the play called life
The theme is
Success
Love and joy
Death
So hollow
Fragile
They dance upon the roses.
They dance until the time is near
The surface they dance on collapses
What a shame... I won't be there

Meek embodiments of suicide
Enjoying while I abide
You may bathe in your ""purity""
But there will be the day when I take it all away from you

As you don't belong - Here or there
And be prepared for all I bear

Your soil will be thrown away but my sky shall remain
Dearly injected, infected, packed pain
""Noil me tangere"" for all

You don't belong - Here or there
And be prepared for... ""I don't care""

Your silent aggression turns to suicidal thoughts

Pain crawls without sound in your soul
Pain remains the same if your life goes on

The beginning of the end
The beginning of the end
Corrodes your soul

Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2005
Diabolic,"These fuckin' snakes man
Fuckin' up our lives
I'll take a piss in your oil fields
I want some motherfuckin' payback so, yo

I wanna run for president, and the focal point when I'm campaigning
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation at Camp David
Demand payment for New Orleans with the best of swordsmen
Launching missiles at the White House while Tech's performing
On the lawn and I just let 'em burn till death's confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause otherwise they'll never learn
I'll form a cruel intent, put anthrax through the vents
From out a package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
I'd let 'em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Let's fuck with them, have the first lady beat me off
Till my semen's launched, then I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I won't leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her trout bleeding out on Condoleezza's couch
I'll seek this route without regrets, and drink a brew then think of you
Cause if it's the last fuckin' thing I do I'll

Yeah, Immortal Technique, Rassy
Nigga, I never forget nothing nigga

Fifty-one percent of the World Bank is owned by the U-S treasury
Robbing third world countries out all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fighting the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin'
We even called 'em freedom fighters
Financed the cost with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran Contra Scandal, niggas took the blame
Started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russia's defeated, America thinks more oil for us
Take over, set up a public government, Arabs ain't bearing it
So the same freedom fighters, George W. call 'em terrorists
Poetic justice, payback's a bitch, these fuckin hypocrites
Like Bill O'Reilly, right-wingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh, drug addict, Giuliani, sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists then show you how my tech's handled
My neck's nano-technologically designed
It spits SARS to all you stupid ass execs that capital resigned

I am vindictive, faggots!

Huh, ha ha ha
Yeah I got something for you motherfuckers ha ha
You want it? Here you go!

The first payback that I would accomplish
I'd draft children from the senate and congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I exposed Joe Cephas for ghost writing the Bible
Making nuclear silos, bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon sized blunts in Maracaibo
Huh, and everyone flashing a gun on a D-V-D
I'd make them niggas shoot it out with N-Y-P-D
And every fucker that didn't buy my C-D
I'd stab the revolution in their neck with an I-V
See me, own the world, I'd give it back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core, fuck with the gay list
Niggas pop on they block but they globally nameless
I'd show the hood real gangsters and make 'em famous
Langley Virginia, where my connect for cocaine is
I'd make everybody fuckin' have the world darkening
I make rap-about lyrics, not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgin's broken hymen
Holding De Beers reclining, while they choke on they diamonds
My designing's like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a universe inside solitary confinement
I'd reverse Rockefeller laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the President free styling off a the dome

A message to the outgoing president
Hey I got a great idea nigga
Kill yourself
Ha ha ha, you know it's so funny, 
I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Ah why don't you kill yourself?
Ha ha ha ha ha, kill yourself",The Payback,2008

On the lawn and I just let 'em burn till death's confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause otherwise they'll never learn
I'll form a cruel intent, put anthrax through the vents
From out a package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
I'd let 'em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Let's fuck with them, have the first lady beat me off
Till my semen's launched, then I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I won't leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her trout bleeding out on Condoleezza's couch
I'll seek this route without regrets, and drink a brew then think of you
Cause if it's the last fuckin' thing I do I'll

Yeah, Immortal Technique, Rassy
Nigga, I never forget nothing nigga

Fifty-one percent of the World Bank is owned by the U-S treasury
Robbing third world countries out all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fighting the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin'
We even called 'em freedom fighters
Financed the cost with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran Contra Scandal, niggas took the blame
Started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russia's defeated, America thinks more oil for us
Take over, set up a public government, Arabs ain't bearing it
So the same freedom fighters, George W. call 'em terrorists
Poetic justice, payback's a bitch, these fuckin hypocrites
Like Bill O'Reilly, right-wingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh, drug addict, Giuliani, sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists then show you how my tech's handled
My neck's nano-technologically designed
It spits SARS to all you stupid ass execs that capital resigned

I am vindictive, faggots!

Huh, ha ha ha
Yeah I got something for you motherfuckers ha ha
You want it? Here you go!

The first payback that I would accomplish
I'd draft children from the senate and congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I exposed Joe Cephas for ghost writing the Bible
Making nuclear silos, bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon sized blunts in Maracaibo
Huh, and everyone flashing a gun on a D-V-D
I'd make them niggas shoot it out with N-Y-P-D
And every fucker that didn't buy my C-D
I'd stab the revolution in their neck with an I-V
See me, own the world, I'd give it back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core, fuck with the gay list
Niggas pop on they block but they globally nameless
I'd show the hood real gangsters and make 'em famous
Langley Virginia, where my connect for cocaine is
I'd make everybody fuckin' have the world darkening
I make rap-about lyrics, not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgin's broken hymen
Holding De Beers reclining, while they choke on they diamonds
My designing's like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a universe inside solitary confinement
I'd reverse Rockefeller laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the President free styling off a the dome

A message to the outgoing president
Hey I got a great idea nigga
Kill yourself
Ha ha ha, you know it's so funny, 
I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Ah why don't you kill yourself?

Of far so distant starlight
Above the obsolete horizonlines death came to reap
Towards the cosmic hillsides beyond the lunar galaxy
Closing down the fleshworld
Forever as the soulside awakes
Whirling down a maelstrom of horror infernal
Possessed by the grim and bleak eyes
Of the seventh moon..
Breathing the rippeling rhythm of the coldest night
Through shadows hearses must be led across
The puzzling constellation of a deathrune
The ancient sign of magic
Divine and flamboyance burning
Old dusty thresholds and rusty gateways
Unentered and unseen
A spiritpath in the thirteenth dimension
Cursed for evilcraft
Obstreperous skyways of nightfall ornaments
Cloudrealm corridors of miles and miles with mist
Solarlight trapped into the blackest corner of universe
The darkened space enthroned
And time is moving backwards..
Breathing the rhythm of the coldest night
An ancient sign of magic divine
A darkened dungeon for the pale I seek
A spiritpath for the thirteenth soul
The sky is raised from a nightfall dream
By the bodies with their souls in black
Burning close in the cryptic night
Rip young hearts out in the fields of light
Horror infernal - The seventh moon - The coldest night
Her world described - The deathruler's sign
Flamboyance burning - An ancient deathcry
Old dusty thresholds and rusty gateways
Unentered and unseen..
Obstreperous skyways of nightfall colours
Oblivious to a spiritpath breathing of doom..

Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 

Oh, I'm up before the birds 
Groundhog day, let my dreams replay 
Good morning, am I really awake 
Or am I lost in the moment in the dreamy state 

Thinking back to the days when it was all simple 
Sap, hip, politics, no big issue 
Win some, lose some, go and brush it off man 
But now days everybody's got it twisted 

No time to love but plenty of time to dis you 
Why they miss you, I see the way 
Yeah I, yeah I'm a dreamer, a true believer 
Pray for better days hoping things will change 

So I, let the sun shine wash away the pain 
Live to see the day when my kids can say 
It's been a long time coming through 
The change in the air and it all feels good (we made it) 

I, day dreaming every day 
My head's so far away 
Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer

I live my life, live my life to the fullest 
I walk around, all peaceful like a Buddhist 

So check me out, if your mind is a mess now 
You always tryna hide that you're stressed out 
Man, you need to chill out, take a deep breath, 
Think what it's really bout 

I, remember when I was a child 
I was so wild, couldn't keep me in the house 
I'd be out all day playing in the park 
My mum called my name every time it gets dark 

Cause I come from a place where you only get nightmares 
People shout it down so you never put it out there 
Keep it to yourself, and that's what it's best kept 
This is the recipe, behind my success, so

I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer

My head's so far away 
Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 

I'm sitting in a room and I'm daydreaming 
How this success is a strange feeling 
Will it all last? Or will it all pass? 
And all this random sh*t that my brain deals with 

Yeah, I got my head in the clouds 
Random raps, got the phone out to get it all down 
Thinking bout the next show and expecting a crowd 
Too excited, got a Valium to settle me down 

Spent years home at mum and dads messing around 
But now my favorite part of it is my parents are proud 
Never listen to the hater if you getting me down 
And no words are ever stopping me progressing my sound, no 

Stay positive, I do prefer this 
Looking forward to the things that I can do with my kids 
And I'm thinking bout flying to the moon to work this

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1997
Diahann Carroll,"Oh, it's a long, long while
From May to December
But the days grow short,
When you reach September.
When the autumn weather
Turn leaves to flame
One hasn't got time
For the waiting game.
Oh the days dwindle down
To a precious few 
September, November 
And these few precious days
I'll spend with you.
These precious days
I'll spend with you.
Oh the days dwindle down
To a precious few

And these few precious days
I'll spend with you.

Diahann Carroll,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad Ive had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
Id like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Wont you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1997
Diahann Carroll,"I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing,
Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my 
Something To Live For.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouln't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.

Searching the promenades seeking a clue

Diahann Carroll,"I've been so many places
In my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and
I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and
I'm singing this song for you

[Chorus]

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth with holding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life
You are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and
I was singing this song for you

[Chorus]

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth with holding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better

Cause my love is in there hiding

We were alone and
I was singing this song for you",A Song for You,1997
Diahann Carroll,"Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon
I'm OK, here I'll stay
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love

I will see my true love's smile

Joyful and triumphant,
Oh come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold him, born the king of angels,

Diahann Carroll,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All [Live],2005
Diahann Carroll,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

It's gonna come true, baby.

Diahann Carroll,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Diahann Carroll,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up the piper must be paid

The party's over
The candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why, why, why can't you be good?

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

Where we two can go and try settling down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in this world I crave.

Dial-7,"People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst

But first be a person who needs people
