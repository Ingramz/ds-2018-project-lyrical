Gloriae Dei Ringers,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1999
Gloriana,"I made a living out of living off track
I looked for wrong turns and never looked back
And what I found means nothing now

There's nothing worse than wanting something more
Watching your future walking out that door
That's how I lived, that's what I did

But I'm

Letting go and holding close
To all the things that mean the most

And it feels so good coming home
To all the things that mean the most

The Best thing I finally learned about me
Was finding faith in ways way beyond me
Way beyond me

But I'm letting go and holding close
To all the things that mean the most

And It feels so good coming home
To all the things that mean the most
(mean the most) holding close
(mean the most) let go
(mean the most) don't go

I tell myself that I've come a long way
It gets me through some really dark days
And I regret I'm not there yet

But I'm

Letting go and holding close
To all the things that mean the most

And it feels so good coming home

Ran through the yard

Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you

Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go

Down to see the water in the full moon sky

With Rosie in the front row singing along
Till I got that call, had to hit that road

Yeah the big time is everything I ever wanted
But the spotlight can’t hold a candle to you
Standing up here on this stage, they all say “man, you got it made”
They don’t know, it don’t mean a thing without my Carolina Rose

And I hope that you’re still thinking about me too

First kiss in your pickup truck
Thought I was the one you loved
And boy, boy I was dumb

You played me and baby
You did me oh so wrong
You were huggin' and squeezin'

Still living at your parents' place

I dug myself into a hole, I was feeling out of rush but lost my soul.

And the grass ain’t greener on the other side.
Oh, I can’t believe I haven’t said goodbye,

Lazy dog lyin' in the cool green grass
Never thought life would fly so fast, it don't last

I still hear that old sweet song
A simple melody calling me back home
Where the love grows pure and strong
That's where my heart
That's where my heart belongs

Skippin' stones and kickin' cans
Stealing my first kiss by the lemonade stand
I can't forget those southern nights
Falling stars and fireflies, felt so right

I still hear that old sweet song
A simple melody calling me back home
Where the love grows pure and strong
That's where my heart
That's where my heart belongs

Those family days are all but gone
Everybody moved out, everybody's moved on
When I'm all alone and feeling like
I'm stuck in the middle of this crazy life
I just close my eyes

And I can hear that old sweet song
A simple melody calling me back home

No there wasn't no fireworks up in the sky
Thought it was nothing, we were just having fun

I think about how it started out

Then we spent a couple hours leaning up on your car
Watch the stars fade out, my head on your shoulder

But I never found, whatever it was, whatever we had,

J’ai peut-être mes des défauts, mais j’ai mes qualités 
J’aimerais tant savoir ce que tu penses

Je changerais tes larmes en sourire 
J’ferais en sorte que tes peines ne soient qu’un souvenir 
Après le bonheur, tu n’auras plus a courir 
Car auprès de toi je le ferais venir 
Si toi et moi font nous, on fera des jaloux
Mais je suis prêt à prendre le risque

I of course replied, something here inside cannot be denied. 
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind, 
When your heart's on fire, you must realize, 

Smoke gets in your eyes. 
So I chaffed and then I gaily laughed, 
To think that they could doubt my love, 
Yet today, my love has flown away, 

I am without my love. 
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide, 
So I smile and say when a lovely flame dies,

Across the wasteland, I ride upon swift steed

No turning back now, my journey lies ahead
I won't give up until the sorcerer is dead

With glory overcomes a mighty quest concealed

In ancient castle, frozen for all time
Inside the dungeon my beloved waits to die
Ride fast for vengeance, but I must find a way

Gloryhammer,"The unicorn invasion of Dundee

They came with the first light of dawn
Setting their sights on Dundee
Led by the sorcerer Zargothrax
Slaying all people he sees
They ride to war on once noble beasts
Corrupted by wizard spell
The unicorns used to be good
Now they are forced to serve hell

Down from the mountains
And across the river Tay
An army of undead unicorns
Are riding into the fray

Fireballs and lighting are raining from the sky
Chaos and bloodshed while all the people die
In this epic battle begins the final war
Tragedy will strike this day, prepare thee for
The unicorn invasion of Dundee

The townpeople had little hope
They were not ready for war
Fireballs make everybody die
And buildings collapse to the floor
The beautiful princess was raped
And taken to prison with cry
Angus McFife swears a mighty oath
""I will make Zargothrax die!""

The forces of darkness
Are invading proud Dundee
They must find a hero
To save its destiny

Fireballs and lighting are raining from the sky
Chaos and bloodshed while all the people die
In this epic battle begins the final war
Tragedy will strike this day, prepare thee for
The unicorn invasion of Dundee

And an ominous shadow fell over the battlefield
As the evil wizard Zargothrax rode into the once mighty city of Dundee
Atop an undead unicorn of war
To enthrone himself as its new dark master!

Been walking all day in town of love
On her own going home
Only if someone were there who would understand
How it is feeling like this
So she said, pardon, parlez-vous English?
Where do I find the bus station?
I got a little lost cause I have never been here before
Never thought I would feel so alone, away from home

Why don't you show me around?

Why don't you take me downtown?

I got so scared of the man who was standing there
cause he started to talk and I just didn't understand

My heel came off and then I saw you
I've been looking for you

Glover,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Do you think you follow the divine 

Do you think you are the chose

I was absolutely nothing before

The one word that describes the past
I'm pretty much possessed
We are the reason, I suppose
And we've spoken so I know she knows

Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too,
And I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night I sing this song

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you ever see
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her

Your song for tomorrow
And tell me my name's the one sitting in there somewhere

And dream for me anything, but dream

And left you notes on how to keep your insides dead

If I had any other hands I wouldn't need the voice to tell
The world about the coward that refuses to stand and claim the blood on your hands
If I had any other heart beside my own we might have left you cold

'Cause I've been this awful shade of lonely since your reasons left the room
And I'd see everything get warmer if you decide to follow suit

Still let you know that you're the reason

Or I could quote a page of poetry
To show you what you mean to me
And we go falling somewhere faster
Knowing we don't want to ever fall at all

I just don't think that this will be easy
Saying that you love me
Lying tongues are clumsy
And don't speak when one more word would kill me
Saying that you love me
When lying tongues are clumsy

But who am I to say
That every breath we take
Won't be another pointless kiss we gave away
When what we love we burn
Its from the ashes that we yearn
To be the phoenix that rises from up from the flames

Don't think that this will be easy
Saying that you love me
When lying tongues are clumsy

Don't think that this will be easy

When lying tongues are clumsy

And don't speak when one more word would kill me

Where did the heroes go 'cause tonight we breathe to stand and fight

A promise to fight
When you were sure you were gone
When there wasn't the hope to carry on

We only deserve when
We cherish the burden
Of the brothers beside
When we carry the bones

Go West,"How much longer 'til the curtain rises?
First night stage fright always hypnotizes
Leading ladies never think about it
Live without it

Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away

One more heartbeat and you walk the wire
Why wait? Ooh, it's too late to put out the fire
Almost strangers, can you stop deceiving
Start believing

Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away, 'cause baby

Oh, even when you feel you can't go on
Laughing at the rain you fool no one
If you don't wanna lose what you have found
Then don't look down

Changing partners is just substitution
It's no solution

Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away

Don't look down girl

Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away

Checks his collar
Wondering who will he be tonight?

Is calling out to us tonight
I won't work for my old man
Anymore that you fit into your mamma's plans
There's a place for people like you and me
True love's still got room to breath

And we can drive all night
Into the morning light
Let's go west
It's our ticket out of here
Yeah we can disappear
Let's go west
And that painted sky was made for us
It's everything we ever dreamed of
Let's go west

It's hard to leave this place behind
Got memories turning in my head
Little white house with a picket fence
That protected small town innocence
But it seems like an even trade to me
That security for our destiny

And we can drive all night
Till the morning light
Let's go west
A place that we can go
Where the tall dreams grow
Let's go west
And we'll find a place to call our own
There's somewhere out there we belong
Let's go west

See how we planned for saddened eyes and tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew, my hair it turned to grey
Study your face and fade the frame, too close for comfort now
We can recall the harmony that lingered but sent sour

Run up in his crib like Mr. Rogers
Flip his ass quick put him in gymnastics

Tell Lil Durk let's have a party with my lil shawtys
We ain't getting drunk, but they bringing 40s
I could murder with my fashion you niggas lacking
About to drop a body feel like I'm contracting
Better be rushing to the bank walking like a model
Your man give me neck till I feel his tonsils
My lil homie got the tech loaded for you bastards
Bet he touch a nigga like say a pastor
They say I be slaying on my Kim K, where my corset?
Youngest bitch fucking up these streets like my name was North West
My bitches don't want to talk like a case of strep throat
We rather just get up on it, word to fucking Dej Loaf
Bullets clear you out your brain now you need a mentor
Blow a nigga down like he in a windstorm
All I do is say the word they be running over
Kill a nigga in a week call it that ebola

Where I be at
Who I be with
And what I do

Leave a pussy wet like we having foreplay

Have you ever seen amounts longer than your zip code?
I ain't never had a problem with spending Benjies
Lean upon myself, rest in peace to Pimp C
Got a pocket full of notes
Pay my shooter like D. Rose
I could blow a couple G's
Racked up no double D's
May give him a taste
Nigga like Muhammad, he say it's the bomb
But I'm not Islamic
You know I'm from the Chi, where they bang corners
Heads upon the ground like we tossing quarters
Talking all the tough shit, that rough shit
You gone stumble up and get fucked with
Can't roll with these weak hoes
These niggas sweeter than duck lips
Pulled up in that tinted truck
They gone smoke some like ganja
Doing all that dick riding, you still driving that Hummer?

Thinking back on you,
Memories pass;
My head was leaned against your face
partly on your shoulder, curving your neck.
I tried to clear my thoughts of stress
And let go of the day,
How it began,
whispered your name-

Soft white lights between us falling
forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
beautiful and floating down on us
sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
vanish in air
But you left before you knew
A future holding you.
All you saw of me-
My heart should speak for me,
Then you'd understand
that push away-
It craves compassion and
strong arms to hold her.
You and me
Revolving
angel wings
fluttering
Orange gold
Sunsets bold
Star filled nights
Sweet as Fantasia
And still
A glow surrounding you
The dandelions blew
Our wishes to the wind
Come and bring him back again

forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
beautiful and floating down on us
sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
vanish in air
And I wonder how you felt
-I was melting inside
Opened my eyes
-Felt so bright I was blind
The car we hadn't left
I closed the door
behind
-And I wished you would take me away.
You left before I waved.
By then it was too late.

I'd always remember-

Electrified with lectures, collect respect and ride on

But everyday I count my blessings this way 'cause I know that everyday's a different day. 
My friends can change but his will never change.
And I knew there would be some time, when I would second guess my mind.

So I kept on walking, kept on striving,
Kept on singing and guess who showed up.

As I walked down the street one day, I thought I heard a brother say
'Living in bad conditions can make you feel like no one, 
As long as I, that's why I always try and do my best to search inside.
But I knew there would be a day, when I had to look the other way.

So I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just kept looking and guess who showed up.

I told myself one day to falll on my knees and pray
And never listen to noone if they can't be true to you
No one should spend precious time living for material love
His money, no money no money, can make me happy.
Now it looks a lot clearer outside, 'cause I'm using my eyes.

I close my eyes and
Kept on pushing,
I just stopped looking and guess who showed up.


My friend won't let you down, 
He's always been around.
That's one thing I know for sure. 
Even when I'm wrong, he's right at my door.
He'll never ignore.

Yes, I got a lotta things to say, I can't say them in all one day.
I'll take no credit for the blessings that He's given to me

The meaning of this song is
Never take things on face value

from their state of unawareness

(Up.. side.. down) Uh-huh that's right we gettin down
Guess who's comin to yo' town
I was lost but now I'm found (up.. down)
Now I'm bout to turn America upside down (upside dowwwwn)
(Up.. side.. down) Upside down
(And if you come down) Upside down, upside down
(Up, down, ohhhhhhhhhhhhh)

It's like the great {?} to who made the Egyptian scriptures
I'm spiritual cultivation the way my words entered your dome
No stoppin once the mission is known
You know the topic many prophets can't physically show 'em

And many different pedigrees sent from out the heavens to the chosen
So the struggle is maintain some integrity
And until it's over, I shall remain a soldier
Like Aztecs with aspects that they govern, it's on

want to live, you gotta eat from the tree
And reach the degree, the medicine for my peoples is history lost
And in religion, the mystery cost
Unofficially off brothers who be frosted mentally

Black man recognize the science of life
It's all you, right and exact, it's actual fact
It's all you, everything in existence
The sun the moon the stars the galaxy and every dimension

Fuck a pagan religion, let's look at the state of our livin
And I say it again for all my peoples layin in prison
Cause what's the cure if it don't change the condition?
If it's holy it's pure, undiluted in any form with no mixtures

Many claim a parable and scroll the scriptures
But what's the story if you never catch the whole adventure
And we want the facts right now
Or else we bout to turn America, upside down

[Chorus]

Poisonous nights, street life, police lights
A whole nation of men women and kids that don't eat right
It's freedom or death, kingmanship or slaves to success
And why the fuck I owe the government net?

They're puttin holes in my check
While undercovers put the holes in our chest from
Every corner to block they got us posin for death some
Get out of this, but most don't even know what the knowledge is

Children payin tuition to these brainwashed colleges
Still in the same position they had us and still got us in
Look at where all the problems begin
Where the problem begins, is when you motherfuckers try to pretend

And try to act like you ain't really bout the dollars and cents
A scholar was sent, to shed some proper knowledge and gems
More than Pradas and Timbs, papi came to father his kin
I came to add another part to the trend

And add the sword to the devil's lapel
Cause me and him could never have resemblance
Simply cause his level is Hell, never I fail
Never will and never shall, forever real

'Til my words, from now on, 'til I'm dirt
Forever with my five fingers put together puttin in work
I'm your black star power, the now or never shout of let's get free
Your scientist, the future of tomorrow has come

Flicks with the children
Talks by the lake
Walks through your building
The feeling of fresh love
Can't dismiss this

Permanent kisses
The flirting and wishing
Before all the back and forth huffing and hissing
Hear me and listen
I remember our mission

It could be different
(You got some issues too, listen it ain't nothing we can't get through)

It seemed my life was falling
But in this season we were friends
Six days into spring, is where our story begins
You didn't rush a thing,
But you knew you would win

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd be the only one
I dreamt of fairy tales ,that's how we begun
But I was waiting for some magical moment,
That would prove to me, forever would be fine,
Meanwhile my first love, was standing first in line

One of the first times I didn't feel alone,
Is when I was in your arms
You always made me feel at home
We watched the sunrise,cause the night had slipped away
And from then until now, we've been through some different phases
But you love the winter, love the challenge,
Always managed to think that we would make it

[Chorus]

So let me get used to things, cause gradual's my name
I don't dive into the cold, I get in slow
But every day, I'm making peace with loving you,
Peace with being me
Any pieces of us
I claim them all today

For you I'd leave, I'd fly away

But you're so very far away and though everyone can see you
But I look at you different sometimes, I wish, you'd shine for me

Oh I, I can feel you, I can't touch you, it's not the same without you
My world won't spin without you, when I see you you know what I'll do
Just that I'd like to have you, I'd always have to share you

Sun won't set until you come, I wish, I could be the one
You pull in like a tide for the sea, you disappear I wonder, why?

To see if you'll still stay

If I took you for granted, just know I never meant to
I try to be thoughtful, and make sure my heart's pure

Good love's hard to hold... That's why I'm squeezing tight

Sometimes I don't feel you, you don't feel me,
We're distant, we need space
But I'm coming back for you, 'cause you're my true blue
You're a Capricorn, I'm Cancer,
And sometimes we can't relate
But we meet at the center, that's where love is tender

You're my first phone call, my best friend, 
You could never be replaced
If I'm not there beside you-
I'm just a hop, skip, a jump a way
I question everything
It's ten years, and I still can't get it straight
Just know that I love you... Always thinking of you!

Good love's hard to hold... That's why I'm squeezing tight
Good love's hard to hold... That's why I'm squeezing tight

I love that you're so truthful, so willing to work it through
You love so brave!
My passion is your flame; I don't want you to change
You kiss me softly undercovers,
And you never make me beg
You even say ""thank you"", and ""sorry"" when you're rude

I love you today in the purest way
I love you today in the purest way

Never, never... never, never... never, never...

Goapele,"There was boy 'bout two years old
That's much too young too see what would unfold
His dad so bold, so full of lies
Caught up in things that would take his life

He'd leave behind old words unsaid
His loved ones left to deal with it
When his boy got older with less than enough guidance
Needed more assurance, a little strength and courage

But if he knew what he knows now
He may be with us still
If he knew what he knows now, oh

There was girl 'bout three years old
To laugh and play should have been what goes
Her family moved from place to place
Free spirits and money they couldn't waste

She'd be alone more times than few
Too many men trusted and out of view
One took her in and used his mind
Scarred her inside and changed her life

So when she had daughters of her own
Her memories could no longer escape her
They affected all the choices that she would make

But if she knew what she knows now
She wouldn't take the blame
If she knew what she knows now

I was the girl who felt so strong
'Bout anything in this world when I saw wrong
I analyze, sometimes cry alone
When it got too much I had a place to turn

I wish that I could heal your pain
Capture the truth, secrets filled with shame, oh

Cause if you want I'll tell the world
All the things you couldn't say
And hope that you can find your way

Cause I know what I know now
I was preparing for today
If we knew what we know now
We could have made a better day

If we knew what we know now
We'd know there was a different way
If we knew what we know now

But we all learn by example
We can become our worst fear
Certain lessons we should hold on
Some don't serve us anymore

Our parents raised us how they knew how
They didn't know a better way
I just try as hard you could
Don't wanna make the same mistake

Hope that you can find your way

Did you think I couldn't see?
Did you think I'd just dismiss
Your betrayal so easily?

Sick and tired of your negativity
Sick and tired of your contradictions
You should understand
In order to make change more than just words
And ideologies are needed

You've gotta be down to earth
So get it through your head
Nobody appointed you any kind of leader
And to think I once trusted you
I used to call you friend

I can forgive but I can't forget
I won't be hurt by you again

That you've been appointed
As some kind of leader

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts

I couldn't move my legs, I didn't know what to do
I fail to find the words, I try hard to be cool
I die to hear your voice, it's smoothly ringing in the room

I see you a surgeon in the looks, what could you possibly see in me
I lost the job I had, who picked me up when I'm more in doubt
You know I'll let you cut me up, I know you hate to see me bleed
Is it the color of my blood or me in the complete?

You saved 1979 to me it was the end of the world
Yeah right, we're safe, we're cool
I know you always wanted more
Pick me, we're so clean, we'll wake up when the worst is over

Did I tell you I was premature? I'm not fit to follow rules
I always fuck things up I guess that makes life more interesting
You think that I'm absurd, well certainly with you
I am absolutely assured I am ill conceived

There is always something wrong but I need to see it through
I don't mean to be obsessed, I don't need to be amused
I can't stand to be a stain that needs to be removed
If I sacrificed myself then I'd know I never knew you

I know it's the price I pay
You can't feel a heat that's 200 miles away
I'm alone, it was my choice to stay
And stare in an empty mirror at yesterday

I went into a void, you were the void, a maze
If I could keep to myself it keeps me alive untouched
I wear a permanent frown, nervous about my fate
If it's a million to one, I can't hold you down that way

And I know it's the price I pay

I count my paces under my breath
Unconsciously I make my way to you
With nothing left to say I break every promise I make
And when my heart beats it hurts before it gets better
It's gotta get worse so I nurse

Open wounds, open minds, I need you to take the pain away
I forget you and you remind me and I miss you, I missed you

Didn't know that I could feel, didn't know I could fall
I want to take a minute and look at you
The precious way you carry your head
I won't take my eyes off you until I'm dead

We take this path straight to hell

We've got to be put to rest
After we're born to death
You see I just met you
And now I'm trying to forget you

I get so disconnected
I lose my love everyday
I lose it on the street and
Freak out, well and I don't know what to say
I don't know, I don't know what to say
I don't know where to begin
I know I don't belong (out of the law)

We've got to be put to rest
Everyone's born too death
Gravity makes a sound
Pills mean, so get ill, get infected
No sweat just give us injections
You feel sentimental
Deleted memory nothing special
You see I just met you
And now I'm trying to forget you

In a sickening epiphany I learn that it's reversed
I'm all black and blue and hollering cursed
And you know I'll wait for you to wake

I undress you with flames and gut you awake
Take a piss on your grave and you would still feel nothing
I could kill you with pain and without a painkiller
Toss you away and you would still feel nothing

Take a walk to the wishing well, get yourself a drink
Drowning yourself, it's not what you think
Get a hold on the tentacles tearing you apart
Like a splintered stake through your un-slept heart
And you know I'll wait for you, always for you, in vain for you

Cut out of a pattern to nothing familiar

No one died, I was waiting
None will rise, dawn is beautiful
Underground I will haunt you

Well it's easy to be with this
Just take some notes we'll take a piss
On all the shit that sounds so typical
We're fully automatic and we will kill
When amnesia sets in again
Forget yourself remember this that

We're nothing for real

Que no se te haga muy tarde
Y no pueda perdonarte
Ni dar marcha atras..
Entonces buscala buscala ya!

Perdi a mi amor
Ooh uohh ouoh

Yo tampoco me atrevi a buscarla en el momento
Aunque nunca pude dejarla de amar
Poco a poco se convierte en mi enemigo el tiempo
Se la llevo sin vuelta atras

Ay yo le pido a mi pana que no se ponga terco
Por ella pongase a luchar
Mas vale amor seguro que cuatrocientas corriendo
(he dicho!) pongase a pensar

No se si mi condena será seguir solo
O sentenciarme a no volverla a ver
Yo solo estoy seguro
De que me arrepiento de su sufrimiento

Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Y no pueda perdonarte
Ni dar marcha atras..

Y a pesar de los fracasos he encontrado el tiempo
Voy buscando su rastro detras de su aliento
Yo se que he fallado y aqui me arrepiento
En fin
Sin ella a mi la vida se me va perdiendo
Si no la tengo a mi lado sintiendo su cuerpo
Un corazon desolado que se esta muriendo
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que tu iluminas mi sendero
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que nada es igual sin ti

Entonces buscala buscala ya!

And a price was paid, and a lesson was learned
While the smoke filled the sky and the hellfire burned.

Though he's already damned for the things that he's done
You can take a big stick, draw a line in the sand,
Take an eye for an eye and a hand for a hand

While up in the palace an old man is dreaming

Won't you let me come inside now
In your crazy head
What have you got to hide now
In your crazy head

Straight as an arrow
Sharp as a knife
Am I the angel of death or the devil of life?
Don't you keep me waiting
Don't you shut the door
Don't you give me a taste and leave me crying for more
And we're crashing through the walls of the chapel of love

Won't you let me come inside now
In your crazy head
What have you got to hide now
In your crazy head",Crazy Head,1995
God Street Wine,"I remember the sun's clear light
Pushing away the last trace of night
As I awoke on the muddy plain
Fireworks from the night before
Like echoes from a distant war
Rang in my ears and in my brain
And from the hilltop I could see
The ocean sparkling peacefully
The ivory beach's crescent jewel inviting me
Am I the last one left?
Am I the last one left?

And must I ride
To catch the early tide
And walk out, walk out, walk out
Into the sea...

Get down before the shooting begins
Doesn't matter which side wins
In endless rows the bayonets shining
A sole ray of sunlight a moment defining
Shoot! Shoot!
The sergeant called from the rocky crest
While a seagull winged its anxious way
Across the sky to find a nest

Explosion of anger crystallize
Forgotten inner nature rise
And blacken out the sun
Stand, don't run
'Til dark among the hundreds left for dead
I chew the leaden bullethead
And turn my toes to the skies
Try to close my eyes

Mother where have you gone
You didn't come home before dawn
And I need to see your face
'Cause I don't know this place
Lover I'm going away
So many things I forgot to say
I'll see you in the night
In the golden firelight

Coming 'round, coming 'round
Like a circle about to begin again
Going down, going down
Gonna sleep with the fishes and forgotten men

Feels like rain

Takes so long to walk away the pain

Such a curious name
I say it again and again
And it still sounds just the same

Molly M-M-M-Molly
Turns my lovelight on
Every night we been talking on the phone
'Til just about dawn
On a drive down I-95
With Molly's snow-white hand in mine,
Chemical factories and halogen lights
And shivers down my spine

Can I be thinking thoughts of love?
Why does this always take me by surprise?
I must confess her sweet caress
Hit me like Cupid's arrow right between the eyes

[Chorus:]
Molly M-M-M-Molly, make it better now,
Molly M-M-M-Molly, make it alright

Molly, oh Molly do you want to be mine,
Like a flower opening in the sunshine?
Molly, oh Molly is it gonna be kind,
Like a corkscrew opening a bottle of wine?

Every day of the calendar we'll be together
Two cats in the cradle, two birds of a feather,
Staring for hours between your green eyes
No mystery, no puzzle, no lies
So many times I've been hurt, so many 
Times I've cried, 
So many times I thought my heart had died.

Why didn't she love me? 
Why don't she care?
And when I look back 
It's just emptiness there.
Some things so fine never last, it seems,
Not lace-filled fantasies, or lingerie dreams.
And everything I know, 
Everything that's true
Comes back in a circle 
Pointing straight to you, 

[Chorus]

Sweet illusions of the heart
Build palaces out of empty air
And when the palaces fall apart
We cry for what was never there
Molly do you feel my fireworks burning?
Do you feel that nasty old feeling returning?
Love can be crazy, love can be cruel
But I'd rather die a sinner, than a holy fool.

God Street Wine,"When it's late in the evening, no light and no sound
Mind is on empty, defenses are down
I'll shut my eyes to an ocean of blue
And run to you
I'll run to you

My bow bounces over the foamy white crest
I'll hold fast the tiller and pray for the best
And when the storm smashes my raft of bamboo
I'll run to you
I'll run to you

And all the emotions and thoughts in my brain
Are an army of soldiers camped out on the plain
They're sleeping in the sun
And the soldiers in the army are tired and slow
You can set them all up in a row
And see how they run

The fisherman wakes at the first light of day
He casts out his nets in the calm of the bay
And when he gets lonely in his tiny canoe
He'll run to you
He runs to you

The captain is losing his taste for command
He slaps at mosquitoes with the palm of his hand
His uniform's dirty, his report's overdue
So he runs to you
He runs to you

And all of my dreams and desires for more
Are a navy of sailors washed up on the shore
They're sleeping in the sun
And the sailors in the navy are tired and slow
You can set them all up in a row
And see how they run

And all of my clumsy attempts to explain
Are a poor ragtag army marching home in the rain
You can shoot them one by one
And the soldiers in the army are tired and slow
You can set them all up in a row
And see how they run",Run to You,1995

Call you every night on the telephone?

Until I see
You smile at me
From the top-story window of your big 
Stone house.

Bang your piano 'til my wrists get sore

I thought you might pour me a drink
Forty days in the desert

I thought you might comfort me

And after all our nervous Monday morning glances
And after all our dollar ninety-nine romances
And after you had failed to save me
The sky opened up and forgave me

A fallen angel in the night
And it rained
A promise of sunlight
And it rained
A prayer to a lost king

Let the rain wash me down
Pretty soon the ice will melt
And the birds will be back in town
Now I'm movin'
But I got nowhere to go
Pretty soon you'll hear from me
Or see me at the show
And after all the times I spied on you undressing
And after all our tender Conoco caressing
And after you had failed to save me
The sky opened up and forgave me

[Chorus]

Just one more Sunday that I had to see
That nobody's really what they seem to be
And it so hurts my pride
To get shut outside

When I gave up all the things that I thought I knew
When I finally saw that nothing is true
I had nothing to say
And nothing to do...

That we ain't seen the worst of this heat

Shot seventeen holes in the wall

My new bride dies and mama she cries

Maybe fingers press, maybe legs caress
Forgetful tongues their plans confess.
And I lie curled up in the doorstep of the grey sea
And the sky counts possibilities thinking, maybe
Sometimes the stars burn close, within my reach
And sometimes they crash to pieces on the beach

Damp shirt reveals one button breast
Lovers come together thoughtless at last
Maybe all things possible will come to pass.

God-Des,"This is the song dedicated to addiction
Or obsession call it what you like,
Its very unhealthy it can make the sane go crazy
It can make the sane go crazy

VERSE 1
At first it was love, bliss, and happiness. Passion in the motion I expressed.
Overwhelmed by you're presence always content never wanted anybody else I thought if heaven exists its here. Until my happiness turned to tears. All my fears exposed. Like a bad dream with no close. Screaming for help but everytime I wept, you left, you fucking left without once looking back. I didn't know how to react, my love for you was under attack, I couldnt take it. I needed you back. I came cryin' to you, 'till everything was cool, Atleast until I thought it was. Fuck the drugs! Being around you was my buzz. we had a energy a type of chemistry that kept me fiendin for u. But there's no high in the world that lasts forever, lasts forever...

VERSE 2
Whenever we disagree you push me out the door and leave. But you keep the door open, just enuff, that when push comes to shove you can string me along like some fucked up R&B song. 'cause after time apart, you miss me too much. so we have a break up fuck and each time it happens it made the passion even stronger, we stay together longer. But each break up got harder. I had the urge to be violent, jealousy I couldnt hide it. craziness I couldnt fight it. I was losing it. this is one big mind game fueled by pain that I couldnt escape. my sanity has been raped. what happened to fate? this is far from that. this is one fucking giant mistake. I was obsessed with you, you consume my brain. and worst of all it wasn't gonna change.

VERSE 3
I was changing for the worst, little shit made me curse. Each verse that I wrote was therapy.i couldnt cope, I'd smoke weed and flow.Escape in the agony of letting this control me. What is happening to me? I'm getting violent from all the screams and all this fighting. this is sucking all the life from me. This either gonna kill you or kill me. But without the high you give me I'm incomplete, so please accept me, and treat me with a little fucking dignity.'cause I need u. I can't function without u. nothing can replace u. the feeling that you bring is very addicting, very consuming. very controlling. this is killing me I need some fucking therapy. 'cause I'm sick of you controlling me. I wannafunction normally. like everybody else, and again find happiness. I need to know its for the best, I swear to god I'm putting you back on the shelf, miss addiction, 'cause now I'm respectin' myself

Is anybody listenin'?
Do they really understand what's happenin' to us?
'Cause I can't take this shit anymore.
I'm so fuckin' stressed out.
I just want to be free.
Can't stand it. Damn.

Verse 1:
Can you imagine goin' through life ashamed of who you are? 
Hope seems so fuckin' far.
Every TV is tellin' me we don't exist. 
Every church is makin' me dismiss faith, faith in what?! Faith in what I'm doin' is sin and that I'm going to hell and that I can't tell anybody or anyone who I really am.
So we pretend that it's okay that being gay is a fuckin' secret.
Trapped in closets 'cause comin' out is to scaryyy.
Walkin' down a street makes a heart beat fast, 'cause some creep is gonna say or do something that makes us ashamed, so we blame ourselves and doubt who we really are.
Scared to tell our friends, hide the pictures at work, makin' fake names so we can try to fit in. 
'Cause it's to hard when our favorite song comes on and tells us that were wrong (that were wrong).

Chorus:
(Can't stand) Not knowin' your mom.
(Can't stand) Not touchin' your face.
(Can't stand) That I can't marry you.
I can't stand up, but I won't sit down, it's who I am. 

Repeat

Verse 2:
It's the pain, of datin' a girl who's ashamed of me. 
Hides it from her family who's embarrassed of me.
Angy! We can't get married, live normally. That her friends are talkin' about gettin' rings and havin' babies. 
And it's makin' us crazy thinkin' we have to live this life, so painfully. 
Always doubting that it's okay to be in love with eachother, couldn't fathom life without the other.
But the stress of being hated by this ignorance makes us scared to kiss.
We wish that it was different, BUT IT'S NOT.
So we take what we got, we love eachother a lot, but were smart and we recognize this plot. passin' laws that prevent us from adoptin kids. 
Putta twist on the sick catholic preist shit. 
Blame for 'causin' AID, that it's Gods way to kill the gays.
So I pray for the better days.

Chorus:
(Can't stand) Not knowin' your mom.
(Can't stand) Not touchin' your face.
(Can't stand) That I can't marry you.
I can't stand up, but I won't sit down, it's who I am.

what's worse? Might go out, die hard and end up in a hearse
But no time to think about the consequences
The years in jail, fuck the death sentence
All I know is that I need mad cash in a flash
Befo' I gotta kill somebody ass
Might as well be in jail or dead
'cause if you ain't gettin paid then you ain't gettin ahead (that's word nigga)

I'm alive, but I ain't livin, I'm leakin'

I should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue
Fuck a G.E.D., that's like toilet tissue

Runnin with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers
Niggaz fuckin their money up, niggaz gettin knocked
And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block
Though I could start flippin gettin on a mission

But I need much more, no time for bullshittin'

I want to bust somethin, figures, touch somethin'
The heat is on, got a niggaz blood rushin'
I want to touch somethin, niggaz bust somethin'

I'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front

Stay gettin those outside of New York
Bullets from the cornerstone, I'm bringin home a arsen
Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson
Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses
Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous
Back at home sell a few burners
Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal
Walk with benevolence, holdin twin fifths
380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick
That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me

At a station between Bristol and London

Good God it's a snack attack
It's a snack attack
Midnight Sunday asleep on the floor
Curled up in the corner can't take no more
Armies of food invade my sleep
Led by lasagnas ten inches deep
My head is pounding my heart is beating
Cows are mooing sheep are bleating
I'm being haunted by all the meat I've eaten
And then a burglar alarm goes off in my head
And I wake up screaming am I dead or alive
And the clock says five
It's only five in the morning
I'm covered in sweat
Am I hungry? you bet!
Cold turkey's what I'm going through
Cold turkey's what I need
But they hung a sign on my appetite
Saying ""Danger Do Not Feed""
I can't eat no more
I got to use a straw
I can't eat no more
I can't eat no more
And they've even taken away
The pictures of food I had on my wall
And my treasured collection of menus
They screwed up into a ball
In front of my face they flicked it
Out of the window into the night
But they'll never unscramble the combination
They'll never get it right
Now if they made a feature film
That featured only food
I'd wallow in the crowd scenes
While the rest of the audience booed
And if I got myself a video
I could satisfy the need
I could check out the action frame by frame
And watch the calories breed
But I can't eat no more
I got to use a straw
I can't eat no more
I can't eat no more
I got to use a straw
I feel like Kojak sitting in a Cadillac
I gotta eat, I gotta eat a flapjack
A stack, a rack, a six-pack Jack
Just call me Jack Kerouac

Godley & Creme,"I was standing in the station
being pounded by the rain
so I chose the last compartment
of a stationary train
I felt someone get in behind me
but I never caught their eye
but I thought I heard I heard a woman''s voice
whispering goodbye

So I lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and I stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
And although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
I''m sure I heard a woman''s voice cry

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I rolled myself a cigarette
and smoked it on my own
but it didn''t stop the whispers
or the smell of her cologne
Then she rose up out of nowhere
and her hair was full of steam
and she stuck her head out the window
and screamed and screamed, she screamed!

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I picked up an old newspaper to read
and I noticed something very strange indeed
So I looked a little closer
and it chilled me to the bone
""Woman throws herself from speeding train,
identity unknown""
But I recognized the picture of the woman who was dead
and underneath the picture it said

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb

I''ll never be under your thumb forever",Under Your Thumb,1981
Godley & Creme,"Samson was a comfortable racehorse
Samson was an easy ride
Samson was born to be a racehorse
Samson gave us a pony and died
And one day Samson he kicked to the left
Samson he kicked to the right
Samson he kicked out the door
Samson he kicked out his light
He was a thoroughbred
Who knew his time had come
So when the boy pulled the trigger he was ready to go
Here come Delila
She was screaming at the sun
But it's alright
He said it's alright with him
It's alright, it was alright with him
Delila, fell in love in the summertime
But Samson had too much pride
So she loved him
From a distance
She called him black electra-glide
And one day Samson, he turned to the left
Samson he turned to the right
Something was moving through the grass
Something spooky and tight
It was a rattlesnake striking out from the bushes
And Samson was a hero only just in time
Said Delila
I want to be with you forever
If it's alright
And it was alright with him
And it was alright
It was alright with him
They called him Samson
Because his mane was long
And he was carved out of muscle
He was big and strong
We'll build a statue
So he can be with us always
And it's alright
I know it's alright with him
It's alright
I know it's alright with him
Samson grew old in the winter
But Samson still lived for the racing days
But there were rumors
Flying round the racetrack
They were putting him out to graze
So one day Samson he kicked to the left
Samson he kicked to the right
Samson wouldn't wait for the doctor
Samson couldn't live through the night
He was a thoroughbred
Who knew his time had come
And a bullet would be quicker than a broken heart
And Delila, she was carrying his son
So it's alright
It was alright with him
I know it's alright
It's alright with him
He said it's alright
It's alright with him",Samson,1983

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday 
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way 
Read it in a book or write it in a letter 
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee 

Only last night I found myself lost 
By the station called King's Cross 
Dead and wounded on either side 
You know it's only a matter of time 
I've been good and I've been bad 
I've been guilty of hanging around 

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday 
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way

Pop music crackles me to sleep
I tune the dial to Radio Luxembourg
It's better than counting sheep
I wrote away to Radio Caroline
I need to hear your saddest reggae song
And I'll wallow like a zombie in it
Tear up my Ipi Tombi ticket
Let chocolate buttons limbo under my tongue
I've never liked the taste of Lucozade
Another sip of hospital champagne
Charge your glasses ""Radio Luxembourg""
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon
Am I the only one tuned in to Luxembourg tonight
Do they only programme music to accompany my cough
Lousy words and drab percussion
Fading in and out of Russian
I haven't got the strength to turn it off

Save me a mountain to climb
Save me a river to cross
At midnight the sound of the stockyard trains
Wail in the distance and rattle my chains
Save me a valley like the one in the distance
Save me a canyon to swallow this jail

I wanna stand outside and feel the rain when it falls
Breathe the air on the other side of these walls
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out

Save me a desert, just me and the sand
Save me a sea to sail
In my heart I know I'm too weak to be strong
I've been wasting away in this jail for too long

Save a mountain for me

Godselettes Choir,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

But could you send her

Fler ist bester, haargenau, woooow
Ich bin der Typ, der dein Mixtape zerreißt, denn ich hab
„Bizz, Action, Drive""
Heute nacht ist Fler-Zeit, du darfst deine Fresse halten
Ich kauf mir jetzt neue Drogen, geh‘ zum Block, verkauf die alten

Deine Kinder sind abhänging, dein Vater ist im Knast
Deine Mutter fick‘ ich täglich und dein Ghetto tötet dich
Jetzt komm‘ ich – und räum im Rap wieder auf
Ich fick auf deine Flows, Isle of Money ist im Haus
Hardcorerap, alle posen um die Wette, du bist ein Arschloch,
Ein Penner, der gern Geld hätte
Du bist ein Nichts, nur ein Gangster mit eim‘ Messer
Und deine Knarre benutzt du nur Silvester
Ich bin ein Ticker, ein gottverdammter Hustler
Und meine Poster hängen bei der Mafia
Du bist ein krasser Star mit zwei Prozent,
Jetzt kennt jeder diesen Penner, der bei MTV singt
Ich lach mich tot, stattdessen bin ich in L.A.
Und zieh den feinsten Stoff aus der Unterwelt
Ich kenn mehr Leute, als du auf deim Konzert
Und wenn ich eure Fressen seh, lacht das böse Herz

Du gehst brav zur Schule,ich schlaf aus bis 13 Uhr
Ich hab mein Geld, du die Eins in Mathe
Wenn der Lehrer was verlangte war die Antwort: Halt die Klappe!
Yo, ich kacke auf das Leben wie es sein muss
Wenn es das ist was man will mach ich sofort damit Schluss!
Schlechter Einfluss war ich für alle Kinder
1. Klasse, 20 Tadel, und danach war es noch schlimmer
Ich bin nicht nett und fetz mich mit jedem dritten
Wieso glaubst du kann ich dann einfach leise vor dir sitzen?
Du schreibst dein Aufsatz, ich häng in den Straßen ab
Du willst was erreichen, doch da draußen kackst du krass ab
Ich mach nicht schlapp, deine Mutter liebt dich nur
Wenn du bei ihr chillst und noch lernst bis 20 Uhr
Du bist so schlau, was willst du erreichen?
Was ist deine Zukunft? Schwach? Ein Haufen Scheiße!

Bist du mit dir selbst zufrieden, sag mir was bringt dir dein Leben?
Was hast du genommen und dafür zurück gegeben?
Ist es gut so wie es ist, bist du stolz drauf was du bist?
Mach es ruhig wie die anderen, es ist scheiße die du frisst!

Meine Mutter dachte damals ich geh in den Kindergarten
Doch als kleiner Junge machte ich schon Stress in meinen Straßen
Klaute andern Kinder ihre Fahrräder und Bälle
Quälte lahme Tauben mit'ner Tischtenniskelle
Wir spielten alle Rocky und ich brach mir meine Nase
Früher war die Welt so groß wie meine Fußgängerpassage
Auf einmal kam die Schule und viele große Fehler
Kommt ne Tussi wollte ficken und ich boxte meine Lehrer!
Jeden Tag das selbe,ich war ständig beim Direktor
In der 12.Klasse war mir schließlich klar ich mache Schluss!
Ich tat was ich muss,brauchst du Drogen komm zu mir!
Du willst ne heile Welt, dann schau nicht vor deine Tür
Es sind 2 Jahre und ich 3 mal vor Gericht
Jeder redet irgendwas von wegen Arbeit oder Pflicht
3 Jahre Arbeit und jetzt nur noch Arbeitsamt
Ich hab aufgehört zu jobben und fang auch nicht wieder an!
Rap füllt mein Magen, Rap lässt mich in Ruhe schlafen
Ich bin unabhängig und lass mich von keinen mehr verarschen!
Du bist nicht wie ich, also kannst du nicht verstehen
Rap heißt, fick den ganzen Rest und nicht schwul darüber reden!

Bist du mit dir selbst zufrieden, sag mir was bringt dir dein Leben?
Was hast du genommen und dafür zurück gegeben?

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way

And learn to live without a lost love, that bears a cross of shame

Every breath that you can take
Never crosses itself without something changing
Taking me through all your sins
Making me live it again
Nothing in my life comes easy

You never thought to see me and I never thought to care
Like I don't exist to you now, I'm making you disappear
I'm not here to stroke you or to amplify your pride
And I'm taking you for everything it's worth
So let it die

Every breath that you can take
Never crosses itself without something changing
Taking me through all your sins
Making me live it again
Nothing in my life comes easy

Don't justify, I don't hear your nothing
Try to simplify, but you're still in my way
Out of my way

Every breath that you can take
Never crosses itself without something changing
Taking me through all your sins
Making me live it again
Nothing in my life comes easy",Nothing Comes Easy,2014
Godsmack,"Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?

All this noise in my head
Ringing through and echoing
Simple things just take too long, long, long
It's not like I'm not listening
But you just keep on flipping it
And maybe one day I'll be gone, gone, gone

Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
To me that way

Try to leave the past behind me
But you just keep reminding me
And threw it in my face so wrong, wrong, wrong
I try to see things your way
But something changes every day
And every question way too long, long, long

Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way
To me that way, to me that way

I've been missing yesterday
Taking me so far away from where I've been gone, yeah
Making me someone I've never known

Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way
To me that way, to me that way",Something Different,2014
Godsmack,"Leave me bleeding, leave me dying on my own
Leave me wanting, climb your way into my soul
I don't like it, I can't live without a trace
I can't hide it, I can't take away its face

I don't know my name
I've turned against my home
I don't know who to blame
I'm turning into stone, turning to stone

You can't hear me, you can't see me in your space
You don't believe in me, even when you kneel and pray
Since I found you, I've been wanting you so bad
I'm all around you, willing to take those things I never had

I don't know my name
I've turned against my home
I don't know who to blame
I'm turning into stone

Godsmack,"Freezing me, take me by my hand
Show me things I can't understand
For now I'll wait and see
What will become, what will become of me
And time's not gonna wait, not for one day
It's gonna break us the same way

Some of us love and some of us hate
And some of us fear the end won't come our way

In death, life, what's next?
The only thing certain is death
Life, what's next? Is it the only thing?

Born in time, those things that we all love
Not knowing why or where we go when it's all done
So take all you can take
Learn from your life, make no mistake
It's all part of the way
And tell me why, why we're all blind
Why we're all blind from uncertainty

Some of us love and some of us hate
And some of us fear the end won't come our way

In death, life, what's next?
The only thing certain is death
Life, what's next? Is it the only thing?

So many questions, hoping answers somehow come to me
It's getting harder to believe
I'm trying to make sense of this matter
No way I can take
These circumstances helping me
No, I know nothing
I know nothing

Some of us love and some of us hate
And some of us fear the end won't come our way

In death, life, what's next?
The only thing certain is death
Life, what's next? Is it the only thing?

Don't you point your finger at my face
