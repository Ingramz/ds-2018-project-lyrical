Richard Marx,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you",Right Here Waiting [Single Edit],2008
Richard Marx,"Another day just like all the rest
Time marches in place at this address
I can't bring myself to change a single thing
Every photograph still haunts me from its frame
I still can't believe I lost your love
Half empty closets should be proof enough
Tho' you made it clear, there would be no turning back
This flame burns in the face of cold hard facts

Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring
Faithfully, when I should be letting go
Holding on like late November leaves
Crazy Me

I guess that I should get on with my life
Soon as my heart learns the meaning of goodbye
Take the pieces up and put them in their place
If reality was something I could face
Your memory is something I just can't erase

Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring
Faithfully, when I should be letting go
Holding on like late November leaves
Crazy Me",Crazy Me,2009
Richard Marx,"I do it for your love
I'm not sentimental, no one calls me tender
I keep my emotions safe inside
But I've never felt these feelings
And time just keeps revealing
A part of me I can no longer hide
The moment that I kissed your lips
I found a whole new world exists
Look what you've done with my life.
If I write your name a thousand times
Inside a heart next to mine
Act like a fool whose faith is blind
Whatever I do, I do it for your love.
I'm not one for flowers
Or talking on the phone for hours
Fancy words have never been my game
An answered prayer I never prayed
That came true anyway
Now I know I'll never be the same.
If I light a candle in the night
To see the reflection in your eyes
You don't even need to ask me why
Whatever I do, I do it for your love.
I write your name",I Do It For Your Love,2009
Richard Marx,"All at once 
I finally took a moment 
And I'm realizing that 
You're not coming back 
And it's finally hit me all at once 
All at once I've started counting teardrops 
And at least a million fell 
My eyes began to swell 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I looked around and found that you were 
With another love 
In someone else's arms 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 
All at once the smile that used to greet me 
Brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away 
And left me with just memories all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more",All at Once,2009
Richard Marx,"I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all
 
I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all
 
And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",Greatest Love of All,2009
Richard Marx,"I hold you, I touch you
Make you my woman
I'll give you my love
With sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I'll hold you, I'll touch you

There's something in your eyes I see
A pure and simple honesty

Hold me in your arms tonight

Richard Marx,"A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright

Richard Marx,"Met a man who said he's got a villa down in Africa
I asked him what he's doing here, the weather sucks, what's wrong with ya?

He said he's got a gun, and that he's on the run
He used to have a life but it went wrong

Girlfriend's in a coma
He's promised to look after her
He's written to her favourite bands
He's hoping for Metallica

It all looks pretty grim
He wishes it were him
He used to have a life but it went wrong

And he said
Hey, what you living for?
Hey, what you looking for?
I'm not gonna take it any more
Is anybody there? Is anybody out?
Is anybody up? Is anybody down?

I don't think I can take it any more
I don't think I can take it any more

She's cruising in her wheelchair
She's dressed up like [a mexican]
She's holding up the traffic and there's gonna be an accident

I bet she lives alone
Is anybody home?
She used to have a life but it went wrong

And she says
Hey, what you living for?
Hey, what you learning for?
I'm not gonna take it any more

Richard Marx,"Who can say for certain 
Maybe you're still here 
I feel you all around me 
Your memories so clear 

Deep in the stillness 
I can hear you speak 
You're still an inspiration 
Can it be

That you are mine 
Forever love 
And you are watching over me from up above 
Fly me up to where you are 

Beyond the distant star 
I wish upon tonight 
To see you smile 
If only for awhile to know you're there 

A breath away's not far 
To where you are 
Are you gently sleeping 
Here inside my dream 

And isn't faith believing 
All power can't be seen 
As my heart holds you 
Just one beat away 

I cherish all you gave me everyday 
'Cause you are mine 
Forever love 
Watching me from up above 
And I believe 

That angels breathe 
And that love will live on and never leave 
Fly me up 
To where you are 

Beyond the distant star 
I wish upon tonight 
To see you smile 
If only for awhile 

To know you're there

Richard Marx,"Baby, I'[m tryin' to make some sense
Of all we should've learned from experience
We win, we lose, we conquer and we fail
One part serious, do or die
Another part crush in junior high
I'm chasing my emotions like a tail
I can still move my fingers
But I can't seem to let go

The cold winds are blowing, I should be goin'
I'm in over my head
Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'
I would be better off dead
Yeah? I'm in over my head

You made me weak, I made you laugh
Driving through the rain in a yellow cab
The taste of your kiss is with me even now
But this thing we've got goes by different names
Never two days in a row the same
I wanna stop feelin' this, but don't know how

I see my legs and they're moving
But I just can't walk away

The cold winds are blowing, I should be goin'
I'm in over my head
Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'
I would be better off dead
Yeah? I'm in over my head

I'll say goodbye, but talk is cheap
I count the memories in my sleep
I've had enough, but I want more

Makin' me weak, makin' you laugh
Driving through the rain in that yellow cab
Baby, your kiss is with me even now

And miracles have happened

Oh oh

I gotta get the Christmas spirit
I can't get anywhere near it
But I'm here hoping desperately
I'll do it up with all the trimmings
Christmas tree and carols singing
Anything to bring my baby back to me

All I want's a happy ending
Waiting there when I get home
I don't want to wind up spending

Richard Marx,"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head:
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good will to men.""

The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,

The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!

In sin and error pining,

And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks

Richard Marx,"I'm back at the corner
Where we said goodbye
I turn and I see you
But don't trust my eyes
You look at me
And I can't breathe

Had every word perfect
For when this day would come
But standing here now
I can't find even one

Is written on my face

When you loved me

But give me one more minute
One more memory to hold
And wherever you're goin' to
Take this with you

You're gone today but
You'll be back tomorrow

I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be

I still remember when you were maybe 9 or 10 
Afraid of shadows on your wall 
I would hold you tight
Tell you everything's alright 
I'm just a few steps down the hall

Things were oh so simple then 
What I'd give to live it all again

Should have left her in my history
And I feel like I'd be better off dead

Rose colored lies hit me right where she knew me
She took me half the way to paradise

Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle

I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule

In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne

Looked up and said ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle""

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Is all of my life with you

Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.",A Maiden's Prayer,1999

But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave

But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him

They conversate but death row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin' Hennessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath
While beggin' me to keep the peace

What I can see closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about more
Gettin' raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Richard Palalay,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light

Are met in thee tonight

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

No crib for a bed

Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

O come to us, abide with us

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Richard Samuels,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,

'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.

Richard Séguin,"Je sais au fond qu'y à pas personne
Qui peut pour moi franchir la nuit
C'est dur à prendre de dire un jour
Qu'on peut être seul pour traverser sa peur

Laisse–moi traverser avec toi
Laisse–moi m'endormir avec toi
Laisse–moi rentrer au fond de tes rêves
Je veux m'oublier pour mieux me réveiller

Y'a juste toi qui sais ce que je veux fuir
Caché derrière un faux sourire
Quand le silence devient trop lourd
Je me sens trop seul pour l'écouter
Mais ce que je sais pas
C'est que tu m'attends quand je ferme les yeux

Je peux pu me trouver d'autres raisons
J'ai dit un temps que c'était la ville
Après j'ai cru que c'était tout le monde
Qui avait fini par oublier qu'on vit d'amour

Puis je suis parti vivre autrement
J'ai marché longtemps sans étoile
On peut marcher comme ça souvent
Quand on traîne tout son mal en dedans
Mais toi tu savais ça depuis longtemps

J'avais jamais pensé qu'un jour
J'aurais tant besoin d'une épaule
Pour m'appuyer pour m'apaiser
Oh mon amour prends ma vie pour une nuit

Si jamais t'as besoin de moi
Tu pourras fermer les yeux
Je te comprendrai pis je t'amènerai bien loin
Dans une tour au fond de moi",Chanson Pour Marthe,2007

Et les désillusions
Ont des couleurs de feu
Au milieu des néons

Des anges ou des bêtes
Ils sont prêts à mentir
Pour un peu de chaleur









Et les coeurs brisés

Epuisé la pudeur

À découvrir le fleuve

Et il n'y avait que nous deux que nous deux

Fallait qu'on vive côte à côte, sans jamais se quitter des yeux

Un frisson froid quand j'les revois
Lancer les cailloux du mépris
Blesser la vie vaste et profonde

Je frappe aux portes du matin
Plus rien dans les mains
Je frappe aux portes du matin
Pieds nus dans la rosée
Et plus rien à perdre",Aux Portes du Matin,2010
Richard Séguin,"Quand dans ta lyre
je pousserai mes songes
quand dans mes vers
tu choisiras tes sons
quand, même nos rêves
n'auront plus tant d'attrait
quand, même la vie
aura perdu son poids
alors j'espère
que notre joie
saura durer toujours

quand ton âme
s'éloignera de mon corps
quand nos pensées 
voudront faire chambre à part
quand ton regard
n'enfantera plus le mien
quand notre amour
se mettra à sombrer

alors j'espère
que notre peine
ne durera pas toujours


quand d'autre yeux
feront briller mes  yeux
quand d'autres mains
feront jaillir tes reins
quand nos désirs
se verront crucifiés
quand nos paroles
iront jusqu'à tuer

alors j'espère 
que notre haine
ne durera pas toujours

quand ton profil
complétera le mien
quand notre bouche 
n'aura plus qu'un seul joint
quand mes genoux parleront
de ton front
quand dans ma main
se lira ton destin

alors peut-être
que notre amour 
aura duré toujours",Chanson Pour Durer Toujours,2010
Richard Séguin,"Premier amour, premier baiser
Le vent chaud du mois de mai
J'entendais tes rires
Courir dans l'air figé
De l'été suffocant
Qui avait tout son temps
Ta blouse entrouverte
Mon oreille sur ton coeur
Couchés dans le champ
On avait fait le serment
De ne jamais vieillir
De ne jamais mourir

Sous les cheminées
Celles qui brûlent jour et nuit

Le fleuve était caché
Comme il l'a toujours été
Devant le restaurant
On traînait nos quinze ans
On regardait passer
Les cargos étrangers
Baptisés de surnoms
Qu'on leur avait donnés
Chargés d'horizon
De nos rêves déchaînés
Chargés des soirées
Sans savoir où aller
Quand les yeux se ferment
En quittant le rivage
Quand les yeux se ferment
Pour garder cette image

Sous les cheminées
Celles qui brûlent jour et nuit

Dans un pays encore à genoux
Des noms de rues
Empruntés un peu partout
Avenue Broadway
Pare-chocs chromés
Gangs de quartier
Vent de liberté
Cinéma qui se mire
Dans les flaques d'eau
Qu'éclaboussent aussitôt
Les rêves brisés
Semaine rapiécée
En robes du dimanche
Qui refait le trajet
Protégée par les anges

Sous les cheminées
Celles qui brûlent jour et nuit

Le soleil s'endort
Sur la lignée de wagons
À bien regarder
Rien n'a vraiment changé
Derrière la fumée
Maisons d'ouvriers
Les rêves oubliés
L'autre côté du fossé
Et le vent murmure
Entre les peupliers
Le secret des mots
Offert à la vie
Ne jamais vieillir ne jamais mourir
Même s'il fallait y laisser sa peau

Celles qui brûlent jour et nuit",Sous Les Cheminées,2010
Richard Séguin,"Besoin du nord
Le sentir sous mes pieds
Et marcher sur la pierre
Des montagnes sans arbres
Aux mémoires de glaciers

Besoin du nord
Dans mes os, dans ma chair
Un troupeau solitaire
Arrache à coup de nerfs
Nourriture sous la glace
Comme je cherche ma trace

Besoin du nord

Besoin du nord
Le sentir en plein jour
Traverser la rivière
Quand le silence entoure
Le souffle et le battement
Du thorax et du temps

Le sanglot des bungalows
Un dieu pour la gloire des coffres

Sa colère ravalée, le comptoir qui reluit

Crucifix sur le coeur

Sur un chemin de pierres

Me regarde et me sourit

Tu auras peur,
tu auras froid
Tu voudras fuir les voies
Qui te feront la vie dure

Traverser saisons
Sur ton sac de douleurs
Tu reposeras ta tête et ton coeur.

À quoi bon courir
C’est écrit depuis toujours
Tu brûleras ces cahiers
Qui te sont si précieux
Fatigué mais heureux
De tout recommencer
À nouveau te remettre à rêver

Je marche dans mon rêve
Sur un chemin de pierres
Le temps, le vent s’apaisent
S’éloigne mon grand-père
Qu’as-tu d’autre à me dire
Avant de repartir ?
Me donne un sourire
Et fredonne cet air

À quoi bon courir
Musique et poésie
Seront toujours là
Toujours là près de toi
Amies des combats
Qui ne finissent jamais
Amies de l’espoir
Dans la froideur des heures

À quoi bon courir
On emporte rien
Que mémoire de lumière
De toutes petites flammes
Vérités qui font les jours
Tous ces mots d’amour
Qu’on garde à jamais
Au fond du coeur
Qu’on garde à jamais
Au fond du coeur

qui se moque de tout

In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Blowing outside the window as I look around the room

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show

As we chase away the trouble
All the trouble in our hearts

Gone out prowling for the dawn
You and I are left alone
Alone and howling at the trouble",Howling at the Trouble,1992
Richard Shindell,"I sold my old Camaro
I sold my fishing boat
A friend said he would cosign
On a small commercial loan
So I shopped around until I found
A rig within my means
I put fifteen thousand dollars down
On the Kenworth of my dreams

My sister's husband helped me out
When we took the thing apart
Every bolt and piston
I knew them all by heart
We cleaned her out and painted her
And brought her up to speed
I proudly put my name upon
The Kenworth of my dreams

But sometimes late at night
Out on some interstate
I hear those sad country songs
True love found, true love gone
Lately I just turn the damn thing off

A lot of folks just shook their heads
Convinced that I'd lost mine
They said living in a God-damned truck
Is just a waste of time
That to spend yhour life behind the wheel
Ain't as great as it might seem
I just thanked them all and left one night
In the Kenworth of my dreams

But sometimes late at night
Out on some interstate
I hear those sad country songs
True love found, true love gone
Lately I just turn the damn thing off

Business, it's been pretty good
I've no cause to complain
I haul bourbon up to Buffalo
And frozen foods to Maine
Toxic waste or Quaker State
It's all the same to me
I'll go anywhere for anything
In the Kenworth of my dreams....

Richard Shindell,"New York has been buried in snow since last Saturday
The papers said the storm had passed over you
Thank you for the play you wrote about Heloise
And her injury at the hand of an almighty memory

And I might have guessed
That you'd press a rose in the pages
Where Abelard confesses 
His love and his pain
To her lips 

And Nora, it was no sin
They could turn the other cheek
Or take it on the chin 
But Nora, it was no sin 

So Christmas was as blue for you as it was for me
All those angels trumpeting their ecstasy

Your husband has accepted the parish in Greenland
I met him drowning his vows at the bar

And there we raised
The first and the next
And a third glass to you
Hunched on our bar-stools
Calling our truce
By your name 

And Nora, there is no sin 
We can turn the other cheek
Or take it on the chin 

But Nora, there is no sin 
Nora, there is no sin 
Nora, there is no sin",Nora,1992
Richard Shindell,"I adore thee Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of a sorry old elm
Give the gypsy moths a realm of their own
For a postman's fee would I work for Thee
From that tree would I swoop down and leave
A billion blue eggs of eternity
And in no time you'd have your own See

Don't just stare
I mean it, really
Hear my prayer
I give it freely
Are you there Fleur-de-Lis?

I adore thee Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of willow
And fly around not wearing a stitch
For so long has this room been so hollow
We wait at the gate for an echo
In the flesh of your newly cleaned frescoes
Where Jesus holds John to his breast

Wrapped around
And rocking slowly
No one bound
To be so holy
In your gown of fleur-de-lis

I adore thee Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
As a witch would I love you more than any man
So give a wink, give a nod, but give a damn
Be a sport, Mary, and don't tell Dad
He need never know how He's been had
And never you mind about those seven seals

One, two, three
It could be that easy
There we'd be

Richard Shindell,"My name is William Taylor
I was born in '24
Too late to know the Great Fallen
In time to know the Great Fall
When my father died of money
My mother lived in spite
We laughed when nothing was funny
And how we wept when nothing was left

So I left there in boomtown
When I reached fifteen years
I travelled mostly northeast
With my head held mostly down

'Cause they said there was more in Baltimore
Where those shipyards never close
You can sell the man your labor
And send the money home

Broadway found me penniless
The mission found me last
They gave me a coat and three days rest
And when I awoke and left
A shroud of steam surrounded me
And I was borne away
I found myself at Sparrows Point
With a slingshot in my hand.

Standing there around me
Two thousand idle hands
Their heads bowed low, their hopes not high
Their hearts weaned of their homes
Their pockets full of photographs
Their eyes full of goodbyes
I took my place among my kind
And I held my place in line

Now I'm twenty one and well-employed
I send home most of my pay
Which leaves plenty left for cigarrettes
To help me pass the days
With beloved friends surrounding me

A rifle in my hand.",Sparrow's Point,1992
Richard Shindell,"You again
I dreamed of you again
This time you seemed so real
Winking back at me

I feel your ghost again
When I thought you'd gone for real
I'd never say for good

Not I catch my breath and wait
Wide-eyed and half awake

Just the wind
Blows through my dreams again
Thought I had closed the window tight
Against the night

Now I catch my breath and wait
Wide-eyed and wide awake

But you are half a world away
And there is little now that I can say
But that I will always love you
And I'll always miss
And you are always welcome here
You are always welcome here",You Again,1992
Richard Shindell,"Mama, if you could see me now
I'm not the boy you knew in Macon town
They found a uniform about my size
It's a little big I guess, but that's alright
Mama, if you could see me know

Mama, they're treating me right well
The men all say I brought this good luck spell
I am the mascot of the Third Brigade
They will not march unless I lead the way
Mama, they're treating me right well

Mama, I do not have a gun
I'm only lucky when I'm banging on my drum
But I skinned a rabbit for the cook last night
He said that I could keep his bowie knife
Mama, I do not have a gun

Mama, I lost my arrowhead
It was big enough to strike a bobcat dead
Must've fallen when I climbed that tree

And we must move while we've still got the wind

It happened just like that

Beyond the simple fact

There was never any warning
There was never any sign

Before my soul flies from this chamber

Richard Shindell,"Once I tried to row
'Cause you know I hate to fly
so I set out from the coast
But got battered by the tide
As I glided back to shore
I raised an angry oar
And cursed that blue divide

As if it weren't enough
To still be stranded on the wrong side
I landed in the surf
When a breaker hit my blind side
And when my clothes had dried
I hung my head and cried
Beside that blue divide

Because all that time I thought
That you and I were lost
A toss long fallen wide
In that blue divide
That endless blue divide

So I climbed up on a dune
And found Marconi with his radio
He was looking kind of blue
His antenna rusted long ago
Sitting on the cliff
We shared a handkerchief
Above that blue divide

I waved it in the hope
That you owned a telescope
That could pierce that blue divide

I thought I was marooned
Til I caught sight of your balloon
Rising with the moon
Across that blue divide
That endless blue divide

I sometimes dream I'm holding you instead

Richard Shindell,"I was proud to be the soldier
I had been since '83
When I joined to pay for college
Like my brothers before me
I was proud to serve my country
And to be a fine Marine
But pride can not protect me
From the things that I have seen

When they shipped us out of Norfolk
My family came to wave
My Mama stood there
Choking back the tears and looking brave
And though we never spoke of it
We all feared it just the same
Now they tell me I should talk about
The things that I have seen

I was trained to take the good shot
I was trained to clean my gun
They trained me not to talk back
And they trained me not to run
I was trained to be as silent
As the shadow of a hawk
But no one trained me for the silence
Of the things that I have seen

Once I saw an accident
Out on Old Rt. 17
Mama told me not to look at it
As we slowly passed the scene
Thought the image of that wreckage
Was burned into my brain
That did not prepare me
For the things that I have seen

I thought I was a good man
I thought I was elite
I thought I'd fight the good fight
And that I'd never see defeat
Then we won that bloody war
And how we laughed at their retreat
Now I wage a losing battle
Against the things that I have seen

Be glad that modern science
Has given us so much
We can rifle through the channels
Without ever standing up
But I can't find a station
That hasn't had enough
Of this morbid fascination
With the things that I have seen
And me, I can't stop dreaming
About the things that I have seen

She likes to see their colors on the hill
Almost like a rainbow over all of this
She will fly the flag of nowhere

Hidden with the ribbons in her hair
Anywhere she goes, she knows it's always there
Never far away from nowhere

Nowhere is a place inside her head
Though she is not its only citizen
No one knows how many souls there may remain
Carrying a torch for nowhere

Nowhere doesn't have a government
No one can decide how far it may extend
She will not surrender nowhere

So, she is learning how to play the flute
Just because she always wanted to

I did not forget your documents 
No time to waste, why not begin? 
Here's how it works, I've got these faces 
You give them names and I won't deport you 
Make sure you face my tape recorder 

Make no mistake, this fountain pen 
Could put you on a plane by ten 
And by the way, your next of kin 
I know which house she's hiding in 
So now that you know whose skin you're saving 
In this photograph, who's this one waving? 
I think you know, so speak up, amigo 

It says here that by trade you were a fisherman 
Well I'll bet you Indians can really reel them in 
And if you get the chance 
You should try to get up to Lake Michigan 
Well maybe, but then again.... 

Where were we then? Is he your friend? 
Well I recommend that you look again 
Where does he stay? What is his name? 
There is no shame. He'd do the same 
So what do you say? I don't have all day 
It's up to you. Which will it be 
Good citizen or poor campesino? 

My dad used to rent us this place in Ontario 
He showed us how to cast the line and tie the flies 
He used to say that God rewards us for letting the small ones go 
Well maybe, but I don't know 
Anyway, it's easy to bite. You just take the bait 
You can't fight the hook 
Hurts less if you don't try to dive

We hauled them up by hand 
But when we fled, I left them just out past the coral reefs 
They're waiting there for me

Easy as the morning dew

And rises back into the blue
Out beyond the iron  gate 
Out there where you said  you'd wait

There you were right by my side
Reaching down to lift me  high
I held on with all my  might
Held on to a world made right
Out beyond the iron gate
Out there where you  said you'd wait

I saw my children gather  round

The green light flashes go
And it's welcome to Ohio

One eye trained upon the ground

Glasses, coins, and golden rings 

It's ten years since that ragged army 
Limped across these fields of mine 
I gave them bread, I gave them brandy 
Most of all, I gave them time 

My well is deep, the water pure 
The streams are fed by mountain lakes 
I cleaned the brow of many a soldier 
Dousing for my husband's face 

I won't forget our sad farewell 
And how I ran to climb that hill 
Just to watch him walk across the valley 
And disappear into the trees 

Alone there in a sea of blue 
It circles every afternoon 
A single hawk in God's great sky 
Looking down with God's own eyes

I've done all one man can
No one now will rescue me
Here I'll make my stand

The State Police, they came around
They said I should not stay
I thanked them for their kind concerned
And sent them on their way

I've made my preparations
There's nothing left to do
But to sit here in this rocking-chair
Waiting for the storm

The wife and kids have gone up north
They're staying with her mom
And everything I've ever loved
Will soon enough be gone

This ain't no way to live

I've put out in the yard

Give me a moment more
To walk through those rooms again
To walk through that door

I've only to close my eyes
And the wind in the sycamores
Will carry me home

The vine of my memory
Is blooming around those eaves
But it's true it's a chore to tame wisteria

I'm tempted to ring the bell
Mayber they'd let me in
Or maybe it's just as well
To let just be

Remember the price we paid?
It wseemed like a lot back then
Remember the love we made
The day we moved in?

And if I can
Some sugar for the kids
Dry your eyes - I'll be alright

You stay here
And I'll go look for coats
There may still be
Some out on the road
We'll wash them clean with melted snow
The kids don't ever have to know

And I'll go look for guns
I think I know
Where they've hidden some

We won't go without a fight

You stay here

Cause I know where he's not

Richard Shindell,"My name is Mary Magdalen
I come from Palestine
Please excuse these rags I'm in
But I've fallen on hard times
But long ago I had my work
When I was in my prime
But I gave it up, and all for love
It was his career or mine

Jesus loved me
This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine

A love like this will come but once
This I do believe
And I'll not see his like again
As I live and breathe
And I'm sorry if I migh offend
But I will never see
How the tenderness I shared with him
Became a heresy

Jesus loved me
This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine

But I remember nights we spent
Whispering our creed
Our rituals, our sacraments
The stars our canopy
There beneath an olive tree
We'd offer up our plea
God's creation innocent
His arms surrounding me

Jesus loves me
This I know
But why on earth
Did he ever have to go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine",The Ballad of Mary Magdalen,2002

Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight

Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July

Down in town the circuit's full of switchblade lovers, so fast, so shiny, so sharp

As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark

And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore

Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score


Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us

Those pier lights, our carnival life forever

Oh, love me tonight, for I may never see you again

Hey, Sandy girl... my baby


Now the greasers, they tramp the streets or get busted for sleepin' on the beach all night

Them boys in their high heels, ah Sandy, their skins are so white

And me, I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades, bangin' them pleasure machines

Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk, where they all promised to unsnap their jeans

And you know that Tilt-a-Whirl down on the south beach drag? I got on it last night and my shirt got caught

And it kept me spinnin', they didn't think I'd ever get off


Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us

Those pier lights, our carnival life on the water

Runnin', laughin' underneath the boardwalk with the boss's daughter

I remember, Sandy girl... my baby


Sandy, the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me

I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore

She worked that joint under the boardwalk, she was always the girl you saw boppin' down the beach with the radio

Kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of the cheap little seaside bars, and I saw her parked with her lover boy out on the Kokomo

Did you hear, the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do?

For me this carnival life's through-- you ought to quit this scene too


Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us

Those pier lights, our carnival life forever

Oh, love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever

Oh, I mean it, Sandy girl

Richard Shindell,"The merge from the turnpike was murder, but it's never a cinch
It was Friday at five, and no one was giving an inch
They squeezed and the edged and they glared
Half them clearly impaired by rage or exhaustion
The rest were just touchy as hell

Somewhere near Paterson everything slowed to a crawl
The all-news station was thanking someone for the call
It's a van from St. Agnes's choir
There's a nun out there changing a tire
By the time they got by her, tempers were out of control

So they all hit the gas in a dash for position
Bobing and weaving and flashing their highbeams
Fliping the bird and screaming obscenities
A well-insured hoard hell-bent on Saturday

And so they continued west-bound and into the sun
Law and decorum constraining nary a one
By then it was devil-may-care
Not one even vaguely aware
That they had come all the way to the Delaware Water Gap

But how had it happened? They had all missed their exits
How had it happened? Was it some kind of vortex?
And in they all went, bumper to bumper
Faster and faster, no sign of a trooper
In they all went, like sheep to the slaughter
Bankers and carpenters, doctors and lawyers
And in they all went, families in minivans
Ashcroft republicans, weekend militiamen
They followed the river, and rounded the bend
Between minsi and tammany and into their destiny
Lying in ambush right their before them
The angry old sun right on the horizon

Sister Maria tightened the bolts of the spare
She said a quick prayer and put the old van into gear
Thank God that the traffic was light
If she hurried she might not be late
For that evening's performance at the state penetentiary

She entered the common room and their was her choir
Altos and baritones, basses and tenors
Car thieves and crack dealers, mobsters and murderers
Husbands and sons, fathers and brothers
And so it began in glorious harmony
Softly and Tenderly - calling for you and me
With the interstate whining way off in the distance
And the sun going down through the bars of the prison
They poured out their souls, they poured out their memories
They poured out their hopes for what's left of eternity
To sister Maria - her soul like a prism
For the light of forgiveness on all of their faces",Transit,2002
Richard Shindell,"I am a courier
Crawling in the dirt
Toward the front line
As the crow flies
A note stashed in my shirt
From the Prince of Wales
Far above the field
With his marshalls
And their chain-mail
Their banners taut and high

I did not ask him what the note said
He did not offer to explain
It's not my job to ask the questions
I'm just the courier

A flare shot leaves a scar
Burning in the dark
On my forearms
Toward the front line
Then another fifty yards
Crouching in the trench
Clutching bayonettes
A hundred men
All knee-to-chest
A hundred marionettes

I am the string pulled by the sure hand
Animating what was still
I am invisible and faithful
I am a courier

The Captain breaks the seal
And quickly reads the note
On your feet boys
Make you peace boys
Pass those letters down
To this courier
Guardian of the word
Hand him all you've seen
Hand him all you've heard
Hand him all your pearls

He will deliver each by hand
He takes this as a point of honor
To be a courier

Across the room
The sickle moon
Casting faint
And slim reprieve

Island life does have its charms

The constant sun, the steady breeze

Nothing ever happens here

Few are those who do not fall beneath the spell


It?s language is an orphan branch

But one that I can understand

Its cadence is familiar

It shares the old declension from the continent


I came here with a package deal

Everything all prearranged

Three nights at the Grand Hotel

Where all the rooms have ocean views


By latitude and longitude

Mariners will not arrive

Its coordinates are plotted

By its relative position to the rising sea


The lucky few who call it home

Are prosperous and confident

And they manifest a certainty

That, come what may, things will not be otherwise


(Chorus)


But time is on the ocean?s side

The beaches shift, the cliffs erode

Though the engineers do what they can

Everyday another house just slides away


(Chorus)


",The Island,2004
Richard Shindell,"The war was over and the spirit was broken
The hills were smokin' as the men withdrew
We stood on the cliffs
Oh, and watched the ships
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous

Loved ones forsaken
They didn't give a damn
Try to raise a family
End up the enemy

Oh, what a way to go

The high command had them cast away
Some stayed on to finish what they started
They never parted
They're just built that way

They wrote a letter, life here is a whole lot better

Nothin' to declare

All we had was gone
Broke down along the coast
But what hurt the most
When the people there said
""You better keep movin' on""

Everlasting summer filled with ill-content
This government had us walkin' in chains
This isn't my turf
This ain't my season

It was evergreen up until the floods

Points you where you're goin'

You're a lady, I'm a man, you're supposed to understand
How these things are often planned to be
You're romantic, I'm a fool,
You're the teacher, I've come to school
Here I sit and hope that you'll love me
You're pure magic, unlock my chain
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
And so I say with no restraint, be mine, be mine 

Hard to answer I agree
But then I've got to know
I'm not asking you to marry me

Richard Stites,"Yeah, it's ninety-seven going into ninety-eight,
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues.
This is my heart, my purpose in life,
And finally I'm on.
Which brings me to realise that the tough life that I had only made me 
Stronger, true.

[Chorus]
Richard Stites
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.

Growin' up, didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you.
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you.
Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.
I don't know what to do, but this much is true,
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here.
And it's funny how soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now.
Run me down, but when the dough gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said ""Lynisse, please do something with your life.""
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls;
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work;
Told her when I made it big she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around.
To on-stage, throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good, and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now, things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks,
And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes,
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

Richard Stoltzman,"If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time 
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone",If It's Magic,1989
Richard Stoltzman,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Richard Tauber,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
A couple of years ago.","Ein Traum (A Dream), song for voice & piano, Op. 48/6",2000
Richard Tauber,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Richard Tauber,"I have heard all you've been saying
Yet I will love in my own way

Lonely as a desert breeze
I may wonder where I please
Yet I keep on longing
Just to rest a while

Where a sweetheart's tender eyes
Take the place of sand and skies
All the World forgotten
In one Woman's smile

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally
The one my worshiping soul possesses

At her call, I'd give my all
All my life and all my love enduring
This would be a magic World to me
If she were mine alone

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally

Richard Thompson,"She was there one minute
And then she was gone the next
Lying in a pool of herself
With a twisted neck

Oh, she fell from the roof to the ground
There was glass lying all around
She was broken in a hundred pieces
When her body was found

She used to live life
She used to live life with a vengeance
And the chosen would dance
The chosen would dance in attendance

She crossed a lot of people
Some she called friends
She thought she'd live forever
But forever always ends

Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?

Oh, she used to have style
She used to have style and she used it
And they say it turned bad when
The truth came 'round and she refused it

They found some fingerprints
Right around her throat
They didn't find no killer
And they didn't find no note

You got me in a grip that I can't shake
All my feelings are about to break
And love never rains, it pours

I worked my hands 'til they couldn't spell your name
I rolled and I roared 'til I couldn't see your face
I leaned on the jukebox 'til I couldn't hear your voice
Put my head in the sand, but that won't do it

How did the countess slide underneath the door
Why is the wild boy chopping up the floor?

There was Alice the butcher, Tidy and Gunn
Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding

I didn't hear the sound of the tin cans rattle
I didn't hear a teardrop, I didn't hear a prattle
Didn't hear the words of the bible being read
When it's nobody's wedding, nobody's wed

Richard Thompson,"I'm Darby the tinker and my brother is Tam
We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way

A girl could feel special on any such like.""
Says James, to Red Molly, ""My hat's off to you.
It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952.

And I've seen you on the corners and cafes, it seems.
Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme.""
And he pulled her on behind,
And down to Boxhill,

They'd Ride.
Says James, to Red Molly, ""Here's a ring for your right hand.
But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man;
For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen.

I've robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine.
And now I'm twenty-one years, I might make twenty-two.
And I don't mind dyin' but for the love of you.
But if fate should break my stride, then I'll give you my Vincent, To Ride.""

""Come down Red Molly,"" called Sargent McQuade.
""For they've taken young James Aidee for Armed Robbery.
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside.
Oh, come down, Red Molly, to his dying bedside.""

When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left.
He was runnin' out of road. He was runnin' out of breath.
But he smiled, to see her cry.
And said, ""I'll give you my Vincent.
To Ride.""

Said James, ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a '52 Vincent and a Redheaded girl.
Now Nortons and Indians and Greavses won't do.
Oh, they don't have a Soul like a Vincent '52.""

Well he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys.
He said, ""I've got no further use...for these.
I see Angels on Ariels in leather and chrome,
Swoopin' down from Heaven to carry me home.""

And he gave her one last kiss and died.
And he gave her his Vincent.

Richard Thompson,"I was nineteen when I came to town
They called in the Summer of Love
They were burningbabies, burning flags
The Hawks against the Doves

I took a job in the STeamie
Down on Cauldrum Street
I fell in love with a laundry girl
Was working next to me

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

Brown hair zig-zag round her face
And a look of half-surprise
Like a fox caught in the headlights
There was an animal in her eyes

She said, young man, O can't you see
I'm not the factory kind
If you don't take me out of here
I'll surely lose my miind

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

We busked around the market towns
And picked fruit down in Kent
And we could tinker lamps and pots
And knives wherever we went

And I said that we might settle down
Get a few acres dug
Fire burning in the hearth
And babies on the rug

She said O man, you foolish man
It surely sounds like hell
You might be lord of half the world
You'll not own me as well

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

We was camping down the Gower one time
The work was pretty good
She thought we shouldn't wait for frost
And I thought maybe we should

We were drinking more in those days
And tempers reached a pitch
Like a fool I let her run
With the rambling itch

Last I hear she's sleeping out
Back on Derby beat
White Horse in her hip pocket
And a wolfhound at her feet

And they say she even marriend once
A man named Romany Brown
But even a Gypsy caravan
Was too much settliing down

And they say her flower is faded now
Hard weather and hard booze
But maybe that's just hte price you pay
For the chains you refuse

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
And I missher more than ever words could say
If I could just taste
All of her wildness now
If I could hold her in my arms today
Then I wouldn't want her any other way",Beeswing,
Richard Thompson,"Let me rock you in my arms
I'll hold you safe and small
A refugee from the Seraphim
In your rich girl rags and all

Did your dreams die young
Were they too hard won
Did you reach too high and fall
And there is no rest

For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all
Your eyes seem from a different face
They've seen that much that soon

Your cheek too cold, too pale to shine
Like an old and waning moon
And there is no peace
No true release

No secret place to crawl
And there is no rest
For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all

If tears unshed could heal your heat
If words unsaid could sway
Then watch you melt into the night
With Adieu, and rue the day

Did your dreams die young
Were they too hard won
Did you reach too high and fall
And there is no rest

And he blessed you best of all",King of Bohemia,

Oh my MGB-GT, she's a runner now

Cut the rust with the torch and the hacksaw

When I come to town the girls all smile
They say, ""Here's the man with the retro style""

Lockheed discs and twin SUs
Original chrome on the grille now
She looks like a dream in her racing green

Competition's standing still now
I sprayed up her body, I strengthened the frame
I stripped her right down and I built her up again

Now an Alpine's fine if you've got the time
And a Healey'll set you back some
And a TR4 costs a little bit more

But it don't have the same attraction
Hard top handy, in case of the weather
I don't care if it rains forever

Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special

If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game

No, don't renege on our love

Well, give me just an ounce of sympathy
Give me my chains of liberty
There's a rope that binds us and I don't want to break it
If love is a healing why should we forsake it

Well, hunger is hunger and need is need
Am I just another mouth to feed

She dropped the banner and took her prize
And the only food she had was bread and morphine
Ah, but he fed on the shiver in her eyes

By Devonside his love was drifting
He looked for comfort otherwise
And there never was a rope or chain about him
Ah, she held him with the shiver in her eyes

Richard Thompson,"""Get in the car"", she said and drive me into next week
I should have turned her down, blame my curious streak
I never dreamt that we’d be driving into trouble
Until we hit a rock that bent my nose double

I’d say we both were on run, run, run
She looked too fresh for twenty-one, one, one
She slipped her little hand in mine, mine, mine
Said, ""I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine, whine
I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine""

Ah, the wheels were moaning, we were heading ninety-five
The rain was beating down, my engine was alive
The roads were empty as the day turned into night
With every street lamp her face shone white

I asked her name and she just smiled, smiled, smiled
We must have clocked a thousand miles, miles, miles
She said, ""We’ll be there in a while, while, while""
I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine, whine
I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine

I was feeling weary when the car died on me
I pulled her over and the strength just drained from me
The price of running’s getting dearer and dearer
And nothing ever seems to get nearer and nearer

I suppose I didn’t make the grade, grade, grade
When I looked around she’d slipped away, ‘way, ‘way
Out in the night you’ll see her shine, shine, shine
Waiting where the wind don’t whine, whine
Waiting where the wind don’t whine, whine
Waiting where the wind don’t whine

From her high-heeled shoes to her permanent wave
Except maybe she was needing a shave
Was she a woman or a man?

She held me so tight, it was hard for me to stand
Built like a lumberjack, I couldn’t understand

My heart was thumping as we ducked in the door
And then when she kissed me I thought I was sure
If she was a woman or a man

She tied on her roller skates and made her retreat
All I found was a blond wig lying in the street
Was she a woman or a man?

Dying stars of the silver screen
She danced that famous Gypsy dance
With a hole in her tambourine

I was young enough and dumb enough
I swallowed down my Mickey Finn
She'd hijacked a few hearts all right
I went into a tailspin

Don't sing me, don't sing me, don't sing me
No more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me, don't sing me
No more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again

I put my arm around her waist
Says she, young man, you're getting warm
The room was going somewhere without me
And she laughed as she read my palm

Don't sing me, don't sing me, don't sing me
No more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me, don't sing me
No more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again

Stillborn love, passionate dreams, pitiful greed
And the silver tongues of the tinker girls
Who throw their book of life at you
But don't know how to read

She was third generation Transylvanian
I was the seventh son of a seventh son
I begged the band don't play that tune
Please don't beguine the begun

When I awoke, she'd cut and run
She stole my blueprints and my change
Just a horseshoe and a note on the bed
And all it said was--strange

Don't sing me, don't sing me, don't sing me
No more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me, don't sing me
No more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again",Gypsy Love Songs,1988
Richard Thompson,"It was cruel of you to stand at my door and take my hand
Like a drowning man I clung to my defenses
And ten years is a time but your looks, love, it's a crime
And I lost my tongue in the tangle of my senses
And I never was to know that I'd come to miss you so
But time winds down and I turned my back long ago

But I still dream, oh darling I still dream
Oh I still dream, oh Lord knows I still dream

On the killing floor I stand with a stun gun in my hand
Like a cowboy shooting badmen on the range
And nothing satisfies and the soul inside me dies
As I duck each punch and never risk the change
And now you look at me with that same old used-to-be
Oh but time winds down and I turned my back long ago

But I still dream, oh darling I still dream

Ah but now you look at me with that same old used-to-be

Richard Thompson,"Jerusalem on the Jukebox, they talk in tongues on CoronationStreet
Heaven help the Pharisee whose halo has slipped down to hisfeet
A thousand satellite comedians have died for your sins
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels, beat your wings

At poolside picnics they chant for Ferraris and furs
Their muscle-tone sharpens but their hold on reality blurs
You can have your cake and eat it, and never have to puke up athing
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels, beat your wings

In the bathroom mirror they try that Joan of Arc look again
Two parts Ingrid Bergman to one part Shirley MacLaine
The wounds of time kill you but the surgeon's knife only stings
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels, beat your wings

In video-suburbia the blue light flickers and flames
Ecstasy and holy blackmail are the favorite games
And God has the sharpest suit and the cleanest chin
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels, beat your wings

What one-eyed monster comes slouching into your front room

Don't stir in your sleep tonight, my dears
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Egypt Land, Egypt Land
We're all living in Egypt land
Tell me, brother, don't you understand
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Hidden from the eye of chance
The men of shadow dance a dance
And we're all struck into a trance
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Idols rise into the sky
Pyramids soar, Sphinxes lie
Head of dog, Osiris eye
We're all working for the Pharaoh

Egypt Land, Egypt Land
We're all living in Egypt land
Tell me, brother, don't you understand
We're all working for the Pharaoh

I dig a ditch, I shape a stone
Another battlement for his throne
Another day on earth is flown

Moses free my people again

Around his feet the princes kneel
Far beneath we shoulder the wheel

Said you needed a place to crawl
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind
The reckless kind
The reckless kind
You're his, not mine
Say you run with a breakneck crowd
Live your love scenes right out loud
Break hearts all around you're the reckless kind
Said you were well satisfied
Proud to see me by your side
Pride's a worthless thing to the reckless kind
The reckless kind

Love lies shattered on the ground
Jagged pieces all around
Say you'll come back, but I know you're the restless kind

Yankee go home

You can't just kiss and run away
There ain't enough money on a sergeant's pay
When the dance hall girl you banged's in the family way

You turned my sister into a whore
With a pair of silk stockings from the P.X. store
Why don't you leave us alone

My girlfriend won't talk to me
Since she met with a sailor from the land of the free
I'm tired of being alone

And vodka-cola make my teeth go bad
We'll handle this on our own

How many lips, how many hands have held you?
Like I'm holding you tonight

Too many nights, staying up late
Too much powder and too much paint
No, you can't hide from the turning of the tide

Did they run their fingers
Up and down your shabby dress?
Did they find some tender moment
There in your caress?

The boys all say, ""You look so fine""
They don't come back for a second time
Oh, you can't hide from the turning of the tide

Poor little sailor boy
Never set eyes on a woman before
Did he tell you that he'd love you
Darling, for evermore?

Pretty little shoes, cheap perfume
Creaking bed in a hotel room

And soar like an eagle high up there in heaven
His shouts and his curses they are just hymns and praises
To kick-start his mind now and then
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Does God really care for your life in the suburbs?
Your dull little life full of dull little things
And bring up the babies to be just like daddy
And maybe I'll be there when he gives out the wings

But God loves a drunk, although he's a fool
Oh he wets in his pants and he falls off his stool
And he can't hear the insults, and whispers go by him
As he leans in the doorway and he sings sally racket
He can't feel the cold rain beat down on his body
And soak through his clothes to the skin
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Will there be any pen-pushers up there in heaven?
Does crawling and wage-slaving win you God's love?
I pity you worms with your semis and pensions
If you think that'll get you to the kingdom above

Oh God loves a drunk, although he's a clown
Oh you can't help but laugh as he gags and falls down
But he don't give a curse for what people think of him

He's staying alive for just one more pint bottle
Won't you throw him a few pennies, friend?

She fell on her food like a lioness
There was ringing in my ears like an SOS
She said ""You dream too much.
If you think I've a thing for you.
You dream too much. 
It's going to end bad""

The boom box was sounding sweet
We were dancing to a jungle beat
Just when our lips were about to meet
She said ""You dream too much.
Ah who's that girl in your dreams with you?

The way that you do
I hope I'm somewhere else 
The day that you do

A skull necklace like a high priestess

And certain as the mountain slope

We falter at the sight
We stumble in the mire

Prepare to balance on the wire
But we learn to watch together,
And feed on what we see above

 He robs young girls of their hearts' delight,
 Leaving them behind to weep and mourn,
 They never know when they will return.

 He's proper tall, genteel and all,
 And if I don't have him, I'll have none at all.
 
 Oh father, build for me a bonny boat,
 That on the wide ocean I may float
 And every Queen's ship that we pass by,
 There I'll enquire for my sailor boy

 When a Queen's ship they chanced to meet.
 ""You sailors all, pray tell me true,
 Does my sweet William sail among your crew?""
 
 ""Oh no, fair maiden, he is not here
 For he's been drownded we greatly fear
 On yon green island as we passed it by,
 There we lost sight of your sailor boy.""

 And her little boat against a rock did run.

You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confident

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me

My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

The gray skies are gone

Is living again

Of soft sell concrete and rust

Where is the hand you can trust?
Walk down, walk down, walk down

I remember when a farmer was ashamed
If he never put his hand to a plough
You can buy a lot of shame with your money
He's riding in a limousine now
Walk down, walk down, walk down, walk down!

Sweat is the name of this town
It's an ugly old, dirty old disgrace
And now that the steel's shut down
It's fear puts the sweat in a man's face
Walk down, walk down, walk down

Oh now I should have a break like you
But somebody stacked up the decks
Heads are going to roll some day
If we ever get this yoke off our necks

Richard Thompson,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

Closing in on me

With a name that looks like mine.
Just say I drowned in a barrel of wine.

A one way ticket's in my hand
Heading for the chosen land
My troubles will all turn to sand

And if I'm weary I won't care

You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
And I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

No sign of meat on, no sign of gristle

Noble Dukes and Princes stripped of flesh and finery
When the crows have done their job, they say, that's the time for me

Rooms full of skeletons a-dancin' the quadrille
Rows and rows of skulls singin' Blueberry Hill

You're no good to worms but you might become the finest glue

It really couldn't happen to a nicer guy

Put it there pal, put it there
Now and then just throw me a crumb
Put it there pal, put it there
Thanks for the help when I needed it, chum

You saw me drowning, you said I was a fake and laughed
Then you jumped right in and used me for a raft

You shot me down with friendly fire
You were all dressed up to play gun for hire
The rope you threw me was made of barbed wire
But put it there pal, put it there, pal, put it there

I know you mean well, call me a sentimental fool
I know sometimes you've got to be kind to be cruel
When you pat me on the back, that was quite some slap
That kind of compliment, it could kill a chap

So I'll drink your health, oh, this emotion's given me a thirst
But maybe, I'll have my food taster, drink it first

Put it there pal, put it there
You deserve everything you got coming
Put it there pal, put it there
Call me up if you want to come slumming

Some say, you're a rattlesnake in the grass
But I say the sun shines out of your arse

Tied up at the jetty, as bold as you please
With a half-ton of Charlie built in to the bulkhead
Right under the noses of all them police

Who walks into the lair of the deceiver

They say it was my turn
They say I had it coming
They say that’s what you earn
For living through a lie

If I could have my way
I’d leave it all tomorrow
There’s sorrow if I stay
I’ve other fish to fry

When love breaks like a precious string of pearls
A thousand memories, they roll away and scatter
Make believe that there’s ice runs through my veins
Shrug my shoulders as if it doesn’t matter

Richard Thompson,"God never listened to Charlie Parker
Charlie Parker lived in vain
Blasphemer, womanizer
Let a needle numb his brain
Wash away his monkey music
Damn his demons, damn his pain

And what's the point of Albert Einstein
What do we need Physics for'
Heresy's his inspiration
Corrupt and rotten to the core
Curse his devious mathematics
Curse his deadly atom war

Adding to the background noise

Richard Thompson,"Is this the togetherness, she meant so rosy
I thought we'd share a continent so cosy
I thought love's passions really
Would be more touchy feely

She said it was destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there?

She said it was in the stars
Something that just had to be
But Venus aligned with Mars
Always really takes it out of me

Oh, I'm not proud of my deceit, you know that
To come so near and then retreat, you know that
One beat before I fell
Somewhere I heard a bell ring, ring

She said it was destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there?

There's clouds across my crystal ball, too misty
Was I too quick to give it all when she kissed me?
She's thrown a net on me, razor wire geometry

She said it was destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there?

The moon is peeping through
Old wives say, young man, you'd better
Watch your P's and Q's

Life is good on Mutton Street
If you know the why and where
Romping on the bomb sites
There's magic everywhere

we're the boys of Mutton Street

We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street

We came upon those Burley boys
They were shaking like a leaf
We had our stones and dusters
We were armed right to the teeth

We fired a friendly volley
And we only maimed a few
And quick as greasy lightning
They disappeared from view

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

Now, bonfire night it was a sight
The bonfire, how it blazed
Nearly set the street alight
So they called the fire brigade

The fire brigade got busy
But we cut the hoses clean
And suddenly the Mutton Boys
Were nowhere to be seen

we're the boys of Mutton Street

We're the boys of Mutton Street

Got soda pop and news
Scott and Son?s got toys for boys
But they push their Christian views

And now you shine your little star
And did you come so far

Pledge myself forever?

She was an Air New Zealand hostess
They were mystically joined like Rawicz and Landauer
Like Pinky and Perky, like Porgy and Bess

Oh, he loved the pursuit and the romance
But the details were more of a chore
When the bride's veil lifted, his mind soon drifted
At least that's what happened before

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

Oh, she loved the clinking of glasses
When the toast was to nobles and princes
In the conjugal nest she was seen at her best
With her keen eye for curtains and chintzes

And she had all of the furniture ordered
By the time they were naming the date
And her mother came speeding from distant Dunedin
To help with the flowers and cake

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

At the Chapel of Partial Remembrance
The ushers went into a seizure
Mr. Bacchus, they said, ""Should we stand on our heads
Would sackcloth and ashes displease you?""

And they honeymooned down in Ibiza
Where the sun and the nightlife were hot
As she lay on the sand, he said, ""Isn't it grand?
I bring all of my wives to this spot""

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

A life of volcanic activity
Left him nothing to spout but hot air
A long interruption since his last eruption
Was disguised by sheer devil may care

But some charm and some skill, and manoeuvre
Had him rising to meet the occasion
And for once they found bliss but news of their tryst
Got to Fleet Street and caused a sensation

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

The Press was baying for blood now
They gave them a week at the most
We were all glad to see it reach weeks two and three
But the fourth week, the whole thing was toast

And she dragged her tail back to New Zealand
With threats of High Court and revenge
Meanwhile his eye did stray to the ample bustier
Of a novelty dancer from Penge

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

That I'm sorry to not be in touch
It?s been quite a parade, but my thoughts never strayed
Too far, or too long, or too much

Miss Patsy, forgive all the choices I made
I've been fighting shadows on the wrong crusade
Looking for ghosts in a penny arcade
Miss Patsy, no more will I roam
Miss Patsy, won't you carry me home?

They held me to ransom back there in the foothills
And nobody stumped up a bean
Not Swifty, nor Eddie, came up with the ready
It can make you think people plain mean

I've been hanging out with some virtuous people
They emptied my bank account twice
They gave me self-confidence, even some clothes
And a truckload of love and advice

When they gave out the cyanide pills with a wink
And said, ""Wait for the word, any day now, we think""
I knew it was time to pull back from the brink
Miss Patsy, no more will I roam
Miss Patsy, won't you carry me home?

Miss Patsy, I looked at myself in the mirror
Decided I needed some work
Got me a nose job, a shave and a haircut
To drive all them ladies berserk

But the arm 'round my waist was a man in dark blue
He said, ""ain't you him? we've been looking for you""
Now I'm sharing a cell with a holy kung fu

Is it wise to be bleeding in a shark-filled sea?

Should have read the small print

Out of teeth and nails and driftwood

Living skeletons for neighbors

Quick before she's dead

You pour on in the place of charm
When you've got some shopgirl by the arm
Steering her into bed

That virgin forest you chopped down
To build another ugly town
I?ll tell your wife you bribed them 'round
To back your plan instead

But perhaps she doesn't want to see
The heel that you turned out to be
That's why, she?ll take a gin or three
To drive doubts from her head

While she's working hard enough
With housework, kids, and all that stuff
You're out there with some bit of fluff

Socially a bit of a failure
Nice not to have to try too much

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the pewter skies over North West Eleven

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the governmental sky over North West Eleven

A serious hobby in the garden shed
Model trains or soldiers in lead
Join the suburban boffins of Britain
Experts on trivial things

And holidays in the Yorkshire Dales
Or cycling tours of the North of Wales
Unenvious of those flea bitten
On continental flings

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the pewter skies over North West Eleven

Excitement comes by subtle means
The satisfaction of routines
Small revenges at the office
Smug little victories

You work on your pallor, complexion like paste
Like the gray defeat on an inmates face
A life spent adding losses and profits
Resigning by degrees

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the pewter skies over North West Eleven

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the governmental sky over North West Eleven

And come to the end, sad and alone
A steady reliable tumor you've grown
From selfish years, while all your peers
Have stressfully jogged to health

In life you always were quite numb
And foggier now, you soon succumb
In drab St. Barts on the new by-pass
Death overcomes by stealth

All he ever wanted to be was cruel
At 12 years old, fate marked his brow
And he said, ""I have a mission now""

But we laughed at his clothes
And the blackheads 'round his nose
When we were boys at school

Teachers spoke of Hannibal and Hector
Nimrod and Nietzsche were more his fuel
Swastikas and pentagrams
Flourished from his tender hands

But we watched in the rain
As the bully beat him up again
When we were boys at school

And he said, ""My camouflage will hide me
I'll be gray as the world is gray
Turn a thousand government corridors
Behind which of a thousand doors
Will I delegate and rule, oh, little boys at school""

All he ever wanted to be was cruel
And sometimes when the night is still
I can feel the gatherin' of his will

And grope to his appointed hour

Where's the joy in a boy who dribbles
When he drinks his tea.
I've seen better manners from
A baby chimpanzee.
On fairground rides you grip the sides,
And scream until you're blue.
You'll be screaming the rest of your life
If he gets hold with you.

Said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!

Why do you monkey my heart around?

When her thoughts were some other place
All that summer my feet never walked on the earth

Among the gorse, among the grey

Among the gorse, among the grey

As if the world were made for me

Among the gorse, among the grey
And they staked him to the ground
Among the gorse, among the grey

And wrapped it round her neck until she breathed no more

And took her to the church to bury what was left

Talking scandal
And a cold
Side of the bed

For I left
A weeping willow
She should be
Lying on my pillow
If I wasn't
Such a hard nose
Such a perfect
Waste of time

Salford Sunday
And I'm dreaming
And it's all
In black and white
I do better
When I'm dreaming
Better than
I did last night

Salford Sunday
And I'm walking
Though the rain
Is pelting down
There's a train goes
Back to London
Hate to leave
This ugly town

For I left
A weeping willow
She should be
Lying on my pillow
If I wasn't
Such a hard nose
Such a perfect
Waste of time

Skies are weeping
Dawn is creeping
Through the blind
Salford Sunday
And I'm aching
For the night
I left behind
For the night
I left behind",Salford Sunday,2013

I must take some measure
To pursue my treasure
Guided by confusion
My compass through the storm

Manfully resist her
Believe my own illusion
Or will passions warm

In the dream I am running
Down a street of molasses
In the dream my feet gain no ground

If I call her lover
Will I soon discover
That her eye is taken
By some fawning friend

Then my glass would shatter
And my mind would scatter
Being so mistaken
The world must end

Put your hands back in their pockets

Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2006
Richard Twardzik Trio,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read ""Dear Love, I've done you wrong,
Now I must set you free""

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

I looked into the muddy waters
And what did I see
I saw a lonely, lonely face
Just looking back at me

Tears in his eyes
Ang a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game

You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

Well, you're gonna be sorry
You treated me this way

Richard Wayne,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,

One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses,1992
Richard Wayne,"Here you come again,
just when I've begun to get myself together,
you waltz right in the door,

Here you come again,
just when I'm about to make it work without you,
you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
and pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.

All you gotta do is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses.
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to;
and shakin' me up so that all I really know
is here you come again and here I go.

There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes

Bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good Morning, Belle
'Morning, Monsieur
Where are you off to
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre and a
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes hurry up

Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour
Good day
How is your family

Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife

I need six eggs
That's too expensive

There must be more than this provincial life

Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle

Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy

Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute

He'll come after them in the night
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall
I say we kill the beast!

We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action boys
It's time to fol-low-me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
'Till he's dead, good and dead kill the beast

No, I won't let you do this

If you're not with us, you're against
Bring the old man

Get your hands off me

We can't have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out

We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me

Get your torch, mount you horse

Through your courage to the stinking place

We're counting on your stud to lead the way
Through a mist to the wood, where we see a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast, just as tall as a mountain,
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased
Steady fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow
Let's get on and here we go

We'll lay siege to the castle, and bring back his head

We have to warn the beast this is all my fault
OH papa what are we going to do

Now, now
We'll think of something

We don't like what we don't
Understand and in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save children and and your wives
So save our village and our lives
Lets kill the beast

I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all

Could it be
Is it she
Scara bleu! Invaders
Encroachers
And they 'ave the mirror
Warn the master If it's a fight they want
We'll be ready for them Who's with me! Arrgh

Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The beast is mine

Find a place, stand aside, we go marching into battle
Unafraid of all the things you just decreed

Raise the ram, sing this song
Here we come at fifty strong
If fifty Frenchmen can be wrong
Let's kill the beast

Pardon me, Master
Leave me in peace
But sir! The castle is under attack

Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast

This isn't working
Oh Lumiere, we must do something
Wait, I know

Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast

What shall we do, Master
It doesn't matter now
Just let them come

And they 'ave the mirror
Warn the master If it's a fight they want
We'll be ready for them Who's with me! Arrgh

Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The beast is mine

Find a place, stand aside, we go marching into battle
Unafraid of all the things you just decreed

Raise the ram, sing this song
Here we come at fifty strong
If fifty Frenchmen can be wrong
Let's kill the beast

Pardon me, Master
Leave me in peace
But sir! The castle is under attack

Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast

This isn't working
Oh Lumiere, we must do something
Wait, I know

Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast

What shall we do, Master
It doesn't matter now
Just let them come

Richard White,"Is he gone?
Oh, can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless

Madame Gaston, can't you just see it?
Madame Gaston, his little wife, ugh
No sir, not me, I guarantee it
I want much more than this provincial life

I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand to have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned",Belle,2018
Richard White,"Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say

Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle",Belle,2011
Richard White,"Help! Someone help me!
Maurice?
Please! Please! I need your help!
He's got her, he's got her locked in the dungeon
Who?
Belle! We must go! Not a minute to lose!
Whoa! Slow down Maurice! Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A Beast! A horrible, monstrous Beast!

Is it a big Beast?

Huge!
With a long, ugly snout?
Hideously ugly!
And sharp, cruel fangs?
Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man We'll help you out
You will? Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
[Maurice is expelled]
Crazy old Maurice!
He's always good for a laugh
Crazy old Maurice Hmm crazy old Maurice Hmm

Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking

A dangerous pastime,

I know
But that wacky old coot is Belle's father,
And his sanity's only ""so-so""
Now the wheels in my head have been turning,
Since I looked at that loony old man
See, I promised myself I'd be married to Belle,
And right now I'm evolving a plan!

If I 
Yes!
Then we'd 
No! Would she?
Guess! 
Now I get it!

Let's go!
No one plots like Gaston,
Takes cheap shots like Gaston,
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston

So his marriage we soon will be celebrating!
My, what a guy!
Gaston!",Gaston (Reprise),2011
Richard White,"The beast will make off with your children
He'll come after them in the night
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall
I say we kill the beast!

We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action boys
It's time to fol-low-me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
'Till he's dead, good and dead kill the beast

No, I won't let you do this

If you're not with us, you're against
Bring the old man

Get your hands off me

We can't have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out

We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me

Get your torch, mount you horse

Through your courage to the stinking place

We're counting on your stud to lead the way
Through a mist to the wood, where we see a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast, just as tall as a mountain,
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased
Steady fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow
Let's get on and here we go

We'll lay siege to the castle, and bring back his head

We have to warn the beast this is all my fault
OH papa what are we going to do

Now, now
We'll think of something

We don't like what we don't
Understand and in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save children and and your wives
So save our village and our lives
Lets kill the beast

I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all

Could it be
Is it she

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

I will be remembering

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

In everything that's light and gay

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
