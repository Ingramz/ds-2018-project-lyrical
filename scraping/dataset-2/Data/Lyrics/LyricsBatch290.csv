Gary Allan,"Today, he told her that he loved her
Put a ring around her finger
And promised her forever, together.

Today, she smiled for all the pictures
And he was right there with her
Making all the memories without me
And it hurts to say this out loud
Looks like she's really gone now

Today, is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her today
So tell me why are these tears in my eyes?
I know I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted today

Today, I thought about the moment I could have said I loved her
And promised her forever together
Today, today it really hit me
That she don't really miss me
She's found a new beginning
And I'm wishing I had one more chance
God knows it's too late for that

Today, is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her today
So tell me why are these tears in my eyes?
I know I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted today

Today, is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted
Today, he told her that he loved her
Put a ring around her finger",Today,2009
Gary Allan,"Scarecrows and devils are the only thing out this way
What that says about me, it's probably true
I've been carrying all these words around
For too long and now it's time to lay them down
I'm here for forgiveness I need it from you

The road was long and it took so much time
But I learned a lot from my mistakes
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of
They made me who I am today
I just got a little lost along the way

I won't blame you if you turn around and slam the door
I understand if you don't want to hear me again
I'm not here to fight, I came to you tonight
To say I'm sorry and to try to make it right
I'm only finding my way back from where I've been, don't know where I've been

The road was long and it took so much time
But I've learned a lot from my mistakes
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of
They made me who I am today
I just got a little lost along the way

The road was long and took so much time
But I learned a lot from my mistakes
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of
Made me who I am today
I just got a little lost
Just been a little lost
I just got a little lost along the way

Scarecrows and devils are the only thing out this way
What that says about me, it's probably true",Along the Way,2010
Gary Allan,"I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heart broke country song 
I ain't really happy 
Unless the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain

And my whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars I should have run away
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain

'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
And hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

I wake up every morning, a thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy 
To find a better way
Oh but I know I'll never change

'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain",Get Off on the Pain,2010
Gary Allan,"All the days that ended well in to tomorrow
All the times I couldn't lay it on the line
This old conscience that I could never follow
I hate to say it but I wish it wasn't mine
All the broken hearts that didn't see it coming
All the tears that should've never hit the floor
All the looking back and mainly all the running
All these reasons that I'm standing at your door

I think I've had enough
This time I've given in
Without you it's too rough
So I'm standing here again
I've finally realized
This love it never dies
I'm really not that tough
No I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough

Life is gonna be a circus
Rain or shine
Heights did always make me nervous
So if you're gonna ride the Ferris Wheel
I'll need your hand in mine

I think I've had enough
This time I've given in
Without you it's too rough
So I'm crawling back again
I've finally realized
This love that never dies
I'm really not that tough
No I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough

I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough

I think I've had enough",I Think I've Had Enough,2010
Gary Allan,"It's been a year since last weekend when you swung by with an old friend
Carried out our future box by box
Stack of mail a tube of toothpaste
An empty zeppelin three cd case
Still a few things here that you forgot
They're just a bad excuse
Just something I can use
To call you

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won't believe
Just don't wake me when you leave
Come on over
Kick me to the ground
Kiss me when I'm down

The bar you're in sounds like it's crowded
People laughin' people shouting
Where you gonna go at closing time
Just pay your tab
And I'll pay your cab
If you want to

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won't believe
Just don't wake me when you leave
Come on over
Kick me to the ground
Kiss me when I'm down

Just an hour or two
Is better than none of you
I miss you

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won't believe
Just don't wake me when you leave
Come on over
Kick me to the ground
Kiss me when I'm down

Gary Allan,"She's been gone about three years
It's been a long road and a million tears
I'm movin' slow but I'm movin' on
The sweetest memories still remain
The laughter we had and the love that we made
Every night I go to bed alone

With no regrets
A piece of mind
Lived so much time in so little time
I'm so glad when she was here
She was mine
From the day we met
To the night she left
I loved her, no regrets

Well time and fate can be controlled
You play the hand that you're dealt
And the dice that you rolled
And who might of questioned God anyway
Well these days when I look back
I know I'm blessed to be loved like that
I still miss her everyday

With no regrets
A piece of mind
Lived so much time in so little time
I'm so glad when she was here she was mine
From the day we met
To the night she left
I loved her, no regrets

Gary Allan,"This life I chose
It's always been hard
Lots of tattoos and scars and broken hearts
And a woman's love
Even hard for me to find
Keeping one's tough when you're gone all the time
Ain't no easy man to understand
Thank God she can

And she gets me
Yeah she gets me
And she takes me just the way the good Lord made me
All the thoughts that I can't hide
This wild and crazy rock and roll life
She knows won't ever set me free
She's the only woman I need
Yeah she gets me
Yeah she gets me

I ain't no 9 to 5
Ain't no 40 hour week
I know I'm always chasing rainbows she can't see
I know I'm hard to love
And that's why I pray
God will give her patience and the strength to stay
I ain't no easy man to understand
Thank God she can

Gary Allan,"Well I'm gonna show her
That I can forget her
That little girls lovin'
Meant nothin' to me

If you go lookin' at the bottom
of a whiskey bottle, that's where I'll be
Even though, I already know

That ain't gonna fly, that ain't gonna fly
No it didn't work then, and it dont work now
But do or die, I'm gonna try
To enjoy the ride, all the way down

West Coast cutie, comin on to me
Mama tried to warn ya California blonde
Built like a 10, young like a 20
Party til the money is gone

It'll be fun, but in the long run
That ain't gonna fly, that ain't gonna fly
No it didn't work then, and it dont work now

To enjoy the ride, all the way down",That Ain't Gonna Fly,2010
Gary Allan,"Wake up Monday morning lookin' at another 50 hour week
Hit the ground, black coffee, runnin' on 2 hours of sleep
Damned old truck won't start and I've got some place to be by eight
You spin around in circles, cookin' breakfast, runnin' late too
You're stressed out, stretched thin, sometimes it's just like a zoo
We come home tired and weary after making it through on more day.

[Chorus]
And we fly by night
Wrapped around each other 'neath the pale moonlight
Everything in the great big world feels right
Baby you and I, we fly by night


Well, traffic's backed up bumper to bumper for 15 miles
Call you on the phone said ""Hang on babe, it's gonna be a while""
You say, ""Hurry home lover, I'm wearing nothing but a smile for you.""
Already got my coat off as I pull into the drive
Sometimes I think I must be the luckiest man alive
When you pull me down on the couch and slowly slide off my boots.

[Chorus]

No, I wouldn't care if the sun never shined again, again..

[Chorus]

Baby you and I, we fly by night",We Fly by Night,2010
Gary Allan,"When you give yourself away
Love becomes somethin' that you do
Not just somethin' that you say
Ain't it funny how a smile
Makes the world a better place
When you give yourself away

When you open up your heart
You never know how it's gonna end
And that's the scary part
Walls are gonna tumble on down
Dam's gonna break
When you give yourself away

And reaching out for someone
Well, is all that we can do
You reach out for me babe
I'll reach out for you

When you look up to the sky
Feel like ya just don't belong
And wishin' you could fly
You find out you're not alone
And really all the same
When you give yourself away
When you give yourself away

Give yourself away
Never know how it's gonna end
That's the scary part
You've go to give yourself away",When You Give Yourself Away,2010
Gary Allan,"I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keepin' on, when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up, you just keep spinning down, 'round, down

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

So hold your head up and tell yourself that there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose, don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge, put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down, keep on rememberin'

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free
Set you free

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna set you free,
It's gonna run out of pain,
It's gonna set you free",Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain),2012
Gary Allan,"Well I've been out here diggin' a hole,
And the madder I get the deeper I go,
Maybe you're thinkin' I'm a fool,
Well maybe I'm diggin' this hole for you,

I've got bones to pick with you,
I should have known,
You can't be true,
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you should know that when you get home,
I got bones to pick with you

Shoveling dirt and loadin' lead,
Whiskey burnin' up my head,
You can tell your friend I know the news,
And I'll deal with him when I'm done with you

I've got bones to pick with you,
I should have known,
You can't be true,
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you should know that when you get home,
That I got bones to pick with you!

Yeah maybe you best just leave this town,
Yeah probably before the sun goes down,
'Cause the Devil already knows my name,
And you can ask him yourself when I see you again!

Bones, to pick with you,
I should have known,
You cant be true,
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you just know when you get home,
I've got bones, I've got bones,
To pick with you,
I should have known,
You can't be true

We want what's due,
And you just know when you get home,
I've got bones to pick with you!

Gary Allan,"Drop, raindrop fallin’ from the sky like magic
Can ya feel it in the air
Drop, you oughta drop on by ’cause it’s warm inside
And there’s a storm out there

I’ll drop, another log on to the fire
Get the flame a little higher
“Til it feels just right
And I’ll drop, a blanket on the floor
There’s some wine I’m gonna pour
And pull the shades down tight

Ain’t nowhere you need to be
Then wrapped up here with me
I’ll turn the lights down, way down low
You let that dress drop nice and slow
Girl, I know it’s true
You know just what to do
To make me drop everything for you

Drop, your hair down your shoulders
Get a little closer ’cause it’s that kinda day
I’ll drop, drop the needle on the record

Gary Allan,"I had a broken watch on a broken chain
I had a rood that leaked every time it rained
I had an old guitar that wouldn’t stay in tune
But now it sounds just fine since I’ve met you
I’m good as new

I had some crazy thoughts runnin’ through my brain
Wonderin’ if my life was goin’ down the drain
I had a broken heart, broken right in two
But now it’s in one piece since I’ve met you
I’m good as new

You made my life like a lullaby
You put the spark back into my eyes
You put the shine in the shining sea
And you hung the moon where it should be

Now my old yard is looking nice and green
And my old car, well, it’s a clean machine
Even my old dog, she can feel it too
It’s not the same old thing since I’ve met you
I’m good as new

Gary Allan,"I stayed as drunk as I could
For longer than I should
Off ruby-red lips and soft fingertips
And her long blonde hair
Was flowing everywhere
Like a red, red wine
And its stoned my mind

What goes up must come down
It was a hard lesson learned
That was then, this is now

Don’t get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don’t get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
‘Cause comin’ down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart

Oh, I’ve tried to sober up
But I’m jonesin’ way too much
For one more kiss
Mmm, that heavenly bliss
And the longer that I’m dry
Takes me further back in time
When I was her man
Ooo, when I was her man

Losin’ her is gonna be the death of me
I can’t drown her memory out
With Tennessee whiskey

Don’t get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don’t get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
‘Cause comin’ down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart

Don’t get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don’t get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
‘Cause comin’ down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart

Ooo, hungover heart
She’ll leave you with a hungover heart",Hungover Heart,2013
Gary Allan,"I stood there in the middle of the church of the broken people.
Listened to the walking wounded tell their stories.
My turn came I told 'em my name. I said this ain't my first time.
Then a man started talking how the devil and the bottle was ruining my life.
With last night on my breath
I stood up and said

It ain't the whiskey.
It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget.
It ain't the hard times.
It ain't the all nights.
It ain't that easy,
It ain't the whiskey
That's killin' me.

So what do you got for this empty spot inside of me?
The deep dark hole where love used to be.
Before she ripped it out and ran into the arms of someone else.
Y'all sit in this room and you talk like you got some kind of remedy.
Well I hear what you're telling me,
But I've got all the proof I need.

It ain't the whiskey.
It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget.
It ain't the hard times.
It ain't the all nights.
Oh it ain't that easy,
'Cause it ain't the whiskey
That's killin' me.

I've done everything to drown this hurt inside,
But I can't wash you off of my mind.

It ain't the whiskey.
It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget,
It ain't the hard times.
It ain't the all nights.

I don’t have a single care today
Everything is gonna go my way

Lookin’ back upon this life
Standin’ there at the pearly gates
To a golden street paradise

Well, I know that I’ve
Messed up more than a time or two
I’ve lived like hell, I’ve done it well
And I’ve got the scars to prove
When I show up alone at heaven’s door

Sun down here just feels a little hotter
Burnin’ away today ’cause I ain’t got her no more, no more

I’ve never seen you look so happy
You never looked so good in love

And it’s hard to keep my hands to myself
When I know I could never love anybody else
You’re all I want, you’re all I need
And it’s so damn hard to believe
That’s you without me

Well that’s your third glass of chardonnay
And he sure seems to know his way
In what to do and what to say
Well, it’s obvious that you’ve moved on
I’m still getting past you being gone
And he’s going home with you tonight

When I look into your eyes I still get weak
And when I’m this close to you, I just can’t speak
And it’s hard to keep my hands to myself
When I know I could never love anybody else
You’re all I want, you’re all I need
And it’s so damn hard to believe, I can't believe
That’s you without me

Don’t think you’ve ever looked more beautiful
And you’ve never been more gone

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Remember when we were friends
Don't you think we've got some talking to do?

Gary Barlow,"My life is extraordinary fare
I fought the fear and chased the pain
My life doesn't need to be explained
I chose to walk the line as one
Sometimes, as I live upon my island
Cut off from emotion and its pain
Oh, that's when I'm tempted by the waters
The waters that I can take me far away

So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes he knows me, the man is me

My life was once full of people's faces
Brought to me by love which isn't strange
Oh my life had the goodness of blue waters
A day's a day for all I used to say
Sometimes I can sit and cry my heart out
Drowning in my autocratic ways
Oh, that's when I am tempted by the waters
Waters that can take me far away
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes he knows me, the man is me

My life is now full of people's faces
Within the light of change I pulled away
Oh, my life shows that no man is a island
I've exchanged the piece of life I cut away
Now you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found someone now who needs me
No you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found at last the man who knows me
Yes he knows me and the man was me

And then the truth
Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood, then our youth
Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain,
But it came back return to sender
I read your mind and tried to call,
My tears could fill the Albert Hall,
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
Oh what a shame.

So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus, oh
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us
I wrote a letter in my mind,
But the words were so unkind,
About a man I can’t remember
I don’t recall the reasons why,
I must have meant them at the time
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
And that’s how they stay
Oh what a shame.

Words come easy
When they’re true

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fear relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.

Than when we've first begun.",Amazing Grace,2012

Sing it louder, sing it clearer, knowing everyone will hear you,
Make some noise, find your voice tonight.
Sing it stronger, sing together, make this moment last forever,
Old and young shouting love tonight.

To sing we’ve had a lifetime to wait (wait, lifetime to wait)
And see a thousand faces celebrate (celebrate, faces celebrate)
You brought hope, you brought life,
Conquered fear, no it wasn’t always easy,
Stood your ground, kept your faith,
Don’t you see right now the world is listening to what we say?

Gary Barlow,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, 
The homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. 
All that was of value to me was in London. 
By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

Forever Autumn

Journalist
The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. 
The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Journalist
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, 
More and more people joined the painful exodus. 
Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, 
Their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. 

Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, 
And here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, 
Cutting through bridges as though they were paper. 
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, 
Had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. 
This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, 
Without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. 

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. 
I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. 
At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. 
At that very moment, it was raised, 
And I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Gary Barlow,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century 
That human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space 
No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinized
As someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets 
And yet, across the gulf of space
Minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes
And slowly and surely
They drew their plans against us

At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way

And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it
A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilvy came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape 
He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him
Before he could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

It seems totally incredible to me now that
Everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other
From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains
Ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance

It all seemed so safe and tranquil",The Eve of the War,2012
Gary Barlow,"A room full of sadness
A broken heart
And only me to blame

To be held to be loved so

Fly high and let me go
That sky will save your soul
When you pass by then you’ll know
That this gonna take a bit of getting used to
But I know what’s right for you

And no where safe

Do the time
You’re in for life

Oh my friends I hear you sing
The Lord’s my shepherd, really what a song to sing
Why bring me flowers

For the folks I leave behind
I’m in Heaven, well, imagine my surprise
I’m really flattered that you came here to remember
And look I made the news again

It looks so tragic
All switching seats on the Titanic
I’m sad to go
Hope you enjoy the show

A lot of lovely things about me here today
I’m glad you didn’t let the truth get in the way

Gary Barlow,"They took my voice 
Erased my past 
With all that noise 
It couldn't last 
With words so cruel 
I washed my face 
Hoped one day 
I’d wake up in a better place 

Today I took back what was stolen 
And gave new life to what was frozen 
One mouth talking 
A dead man walking 
A thousand faces watched me falling 
I’ve made my peace with what may happen 
Accepted I won’t be in fashion 
Oh you gave, I got it 
Yeh you gave, I got it all back 
Since I saw you last 

When brothers land 
And take what’s good 
You can win a war 
Oh, and shed no blood 
Everybody plays their part 
Oh we let the haters hate 
While everybody’s losing heart 
Lying in the longest grass I sit and wait 

Today I took back what was stolen 
And gave new life to what was frozen 
One mouth talking 
A dead man walking 
A thousand faces watched me falling 
I’ve made my peace with what may happen 
Accepted I won’t be in fashion 
Oh you gave, I got it 
Yeh you gave, I got it all back 
Since I saw you last 


I know you heard
My shout for help 
For those who stood and watched 
Go f*** yourself 
I know you heard my cry for help 
I know you heard I was going through hell 
I know you heard I was losing my mind 
I know you heard it was a matter of time 
I know you heard…",Since I Saw You Last,2013

They don’t waste time dreaming of opportunity

Small town girls they make the whole world turn

Small town girls they make my heart collapse 
It's such a shame the Bible never said that 
The foundations of the world they are built on small town girls 
Small town girls stop at nothing 
They take no prisoners, never try small talking 
And what they have is quite unique 
Their hearts are big enough to wear on their sleeves

Small town girls they make the whole world turn 
Don’t get their fingers burned quite as easy as the rest, oh oh

It's such a shame the Bible never said that

When everybody looks they hide their face

We'll stand straight, we'll walk tall
When we're all that we were

Coming closer and closer
And closer and...

Gary Beach,"And I just want to wish everybody, good luck
Mr. Bloom, hasn't anyone ever told you
It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night

If you do, I tell you
It is certain by the curtain
You are through

Good luck

It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night
Once it's said, you are dead
You will get the worst reviews
You've ever read

Good luck

Even at the Comedie-Francaise
On the opening night they are scared
""Bon chance, mes amis,"" no one says
The only word you ever hear is
Merde

Good luck, good luck, good luck

It's verboten, wishing luck on opening night
Take advice, don't think twice
Or your show will surely end
Up in the Scheiss

Guten lucken

At the famous La Scala in Milan
On opening night it's a rule
In Boccu Lupa they say with Elan
And just for luck they all shout
""Bah fongool""

I got it, now I'll never say
""Good luck"" on opening night
That's the rule, I'm no fool
What do I say, I beg?

What you say is,
""Break a leg""
Break a leg?
Yes, break a leg

If you're clever
Good luck
You'll endeavor
To never, never, never, never
Ever, ever, ever say
On opening night

But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show

When it's time for me to go
And I hear that whistle blow
I'll be waiting in line day or night
Take my hand and lead me down
Lay my burden on the ground
Break these chains and let me stand in the light
Now I know what the game's all about
If that's the way you want to play - count me out
Had enough of alibis, empty promises and lies
Trying to find a better life on my own
There's no easy way I know - now the strains begin to show
Still I'm looking for a light to lead me home
Though my heart's still full of doubt -
There's no way I'm gonna play - so count me out
I've been too long here breaking my back
Doing my best to get through
I never thought I could feel this way
But I need to find something new
It's not the money and it's not the gold
- I just want some peace of mind
My life is racing like a runaway train
Getting faster all the time...
Underneath a golden sky
Far away I'm gonna fly
To a place I know is there in my mind
Like a sailor home to die
With no journey left to try
Throw my spirit in the tide and lead me blind
Now I know what this game's all about
If that's the way you wanna play
Then count me out

People of Europe, I send you the Rainbow of Argentina
(Che:)
Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much
(Aide #1:)
She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
(Aide #2:)
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
(Che:)
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard
(Aide #1:)
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
(Aide #2:)
But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card
Chorus:

Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is yes
(Peron:)
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?
(Che:)
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why
(Eva:)
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!
(Italian admiral:)
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
(Aide #2:)
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
(Che:)
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
(Aide #1:)
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye
(chorus)
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is ...
(Che:) A qualified
(Aides:) Yes
(Che:)
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
(Che:)
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now
(Aide #1:)
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow
(Che:)
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required

(Aide #2:) Would Evita win through?

(Aide #2:) Yes

Gary Burnette,"The twelve of you walked on the earth together
The father was a brother to you all
The teaching that you heard was the Living Word
The wonders and the miracles you saw

There were times of awesome inspiration
There were times you didn't understand
And when He had to go and you felt alone
It must have been so hard to see His plan

I think about the way you carried on
In the face of persecution you stood strong...

[Chorus]
I will follow Christ
I will run the race
Fighting the good fight
Standing on my faith
I will wear the name of Jesus
I will give Him all my life
As for me no matter what the sacrifice
I will follow Christ

Now I don't have to look across the ages
His voice is speaking in my heart today
His Word is like a flame consuming all my shame
His life a shining star to show the way

[Chorus]

I behold Your life and see the man You want me to become
Living like someone whose heart belongs to the kingdom
That was sealed on Calvary
I will show the world what I believe

I will follow Christ
I will run the race
Fighting the good fight

I will wear the name of Jesus
I will give Him all my life

Gary Burr,"I was just leaving, the night was winding down
You touched my shoulder and I turned around
Here we are, the hardest part is done
And all that's left is loving you forever

My heart stopped beating, I couldn't let it show
You were as unexpected as roses in the snow
Just like that I knew you were the one
Now all that's left is loving you forever

In this world we're lucky if we find
A spark that sparks one time
Like when we are together

And in that moment, it happened so fast
My prayers were answered, I found love at last

Take my hand, our life has begun
And all that's left is loving you forever
Here we are, the hardest part is done
And all that's left is loving you forever

Gary Burton,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,2004

I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:

Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""

Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why,

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Gary Burton Quartet,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Hearing guitars like someone in love.

Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1998

My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em til I'm on overload

Beating the drums of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons
You think boys point guns when they run to the sun?
A decoy, Pink Floyd, cause they're comfortably numb
Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket
Trying to go native like faces that get war painted
Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places
Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader
Y'all haters develop and lead the role

Pick and move, or you could die, nigga
Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga
Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms
Some think ""Don't take, will""
But fuck it, you live and learn
Beware of the roots and salty looks
Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook
Pens and needles, hoes and blokes
When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat

And the sun begins to shine
I see my freedom from across the way

And it seems like yes it feels like
A brand new day, yeah
A brand new day oh

I was lost and double crossed
With my hands behind my back
I was longtime hurt and thrown in the dirt
Shoved out on the railroad track
I've been used, abused and so confused
And I had nowhere to run
But I stood and looked
And my eyes got hooked
On that beautiful morning sun

[Chorus]

And the sun shines down all on the ground
Yeah and the grass is oh so green
And my heart is still and I've got the will
And I don't really feel so mean
Here it comes, here it comes
0 here it comes right now
And it comes right in on time
Well it eases me and it pleases me
And it satisfies my mind

A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

The cabin is warm and the snow is deep
And I've got a woman, she lies asleep
When she wakes at tomorrow's dawn
She'll find, poor critter, that her man is gone

My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

My woman was kind and true to me
Thinks she loves me, the mournful she
She's gotta learn that it ain't no use
To love the brother to the old wild goose

My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

Spring is comin' and the ice will break
And I can't linger for a woman's sake
She'll see a shadow pass overhead
She'll find a feather beside my bed

And I must go where the wild goose goes

I can count on you. 
To color my black and white. 
Color my black and white.

I come to life. 
When your here.

Gary Go,"I look in my crystal ball
And see nothing
I quietly wish I had it all
Or at least something

While the short waves
Sends chaos around us
I don't hear a thing
It's all so quiet in Brooklyn

If I had a fresh start
I'd probably fail
So I drink my coffee
And open the mail

Now I hope the cruel words
In your letter
Are baptized by my tears
I would try to make it all better
But it would take years

Cause while I've been feeding your ego
Mine's been wearing thin
It's all so quiet in Brooklyn

I'd get lost anywhere
As long as I'm found
I could be anyone in any town

Why is there no one to help me
Find my way through
Cause if there was someone to help me
Maybe I could help you

Seems everyone's already started
While I don't know where to begin

It's all so quiet
It's all so quiet
It's all so quiet in Brooklyn",Brooklyn,2009

Oh this is where we find the words I'll never talk
Is this where the fuel runs out
Or the starting point to turn it round

I don't know why we're fighting
When we're on the same side
Stop here we're stalling
I cant keep looking backwards

Back when the engines started on their own
Lost in so many different places
So many conversations
Faces I don't wanna face
Without your love in my life
I don't know where were going
But I cant wait to arrive

I don't know why were fighting

Wanted to find out, to know.
Was there an answer, was there really something.
Hidden beneath them below.
Searched in the light and underneath the pictures.
Something was written there.
And through the smiles and under all the color
A message on everything there.

[Chorus]
But it's not imagination
Not imagination
It's not me, look and see for yourself.

Didn't believe it, although I saw myself.
Wanted to look there again,
But it was real and everybody saw it.
When it was shown, pointed out to them,
S.e.xisting, s.e.x.exciting
Written where it doesn't show.
What do we see, the product or the message.
So hard to tell I don't know.

Gary Green,"Now the wings fell to ground as the miles they were crossed
All the years seemed like days as the time it was lost
For without his solutions and reasons for why
He should come up for air to the town once his by

So soon on his way
Shadows from the pathways
Memories of old days

That the journey was long many thoughts filled his mind
As he neared the stop always a dream he would find
But the road that he knew could no longer be seen
And the city lights flickered where lake waters gleamed

With sadness today
Hopes of joy yesterday
Memories of old days

Sky and the trees of his youthful time spent
Only smoke, only paper.  No colour or scent

Fighting for his future and his destinations
There were his friends he'd rely on
Everyone had nothing but their aspirations
Soon dreaming found realization
Winning was his target with deliberation

Now he has everything, tell me why
No one knows him, the veils shut out cutting the tie

So now he's made his own island
Not familiar even to his understanding

Something reassuring in his time and planning
What did he miss, needing nothing?

Words from the wise, encourage you, carries all your taking on,
Words from the wise, discourage too many people when things go wrong.
I have my doubts, as everyone. Little isle in a stormy sea.
Words from the wise, believe in you,  All I do is believe in me.

If the going looks to strong, And a little seems too long
Only darkness in the night, Turn the darkness into 
Light the fire inside of yourself
I'm the one it's nobody else
Listen out. But remember always
Your the wise, The wise.

REPEAT

When it feels so hard to try, Just a weight, a chain, a lie,
Even though you need to fight, make the changes into
Light the fire inside of yourself
I'm the one it's nobody else
Listen out. But remember always
Your the wise, The wise.

Gary Greenlee Jr.,"Once there was a holy place
Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil
Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail
And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

[Chorus:]
Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

[Chorus:

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be
He gently calls to my heart
Just to remind me

I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still  remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine

Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence

Haunts my reverie

I don't give a damn Â´cause
IÂ´m proud of what I am

WonÂ´t apologize
And I wonÂ´t put up with any of your lies
WonÂ´t say sorry to you

WonÂ´t say sorry for the way I act
WonÂ´t say sorry for the manors I lack

Playing in the streets, I was unknowing;

Hoping, 
And praying, Lord, that she could understand me, 
But I didn't know her name. 
She took my hand in hers and told me I was wrong.

As you keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord, 

Just you wait and see. 
We'll be walking,

Gary Holton,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Of a man in the midst of a change

'Cause it's nowhere that she's ever been
When I get to that place she'll remember my face
And say ""Hey man, I knew him when he was younger""
But she never loved me at all
She laughed when I was in pain
'Cause there's something that we are all frightened of
In the man in the midst of a change

Out on the roof to inquire of the sky
The existence of ghosts in my life
Who's to blame you or I?
No one would answer me
They just stared with the weight of the world I pretend not to feel

The windmill is poised for the battle 
But the fool understands not the game
He believes in his mission, predestined position
Amazing the grace of her name
Oh he loves her now as he loved her then

Then you'll know what you need to do""

""You just stay in the bar

Do you swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?

Yeah

First Verse:

I'll begin when I started gettin' violent, sir
Screwin' in my muthafuckin' silencer
I grabbed my 'stol, and then I felt the coldness
People stood around as I told this
Ferocious confession of relentless aggression
I was taught, to shoot first and then ask questions
I sold rocks, I was raised with no pops
My four glocks, twistin' hoes like door knobs
Bitch offered me the pussy, so I took it
They call me a crook, 'cause that's short for crooked
Stayin' high as Hell, and drunk as fuck
You ain't down with the Mex, you can sick my duck
I mean duck my sick, I mean suck my dick
Don't laugh bitch, you know what the fuck I meant
And if I ever come back to the free World
I'ma take my Baby Girl out to Sea World

Can you tell the jury exactly what happened on the night of December second?

Second Verse:

My word is gold, now check, how the murder's told
Bring me back thirteen and my birth is sold
Learn the code, then meet me at the service road
Now you all understand what this person know
Servin' coke, seemed like my purpose so
I was the perfect mold of gangsta you've been searchin' for
But on a further note this cat tryin' to burn my dope
But since the day that Mama gave birth to Los
I heard them hoes, forever be first to smoke
Tryin' to jack a jacker, what's the purpose Loc?
Mercy no, 'cause he smiles and ain't heard the joke
Now he's in his blood, tryin' to write a cursive note
I snatch his (???) up, he looked like he turned to chrome
That boy got a date with Dirt, in the Earth below
With the worms, that hoe left on an early note
I seen him run the red light, and I heard she broke

Chorus

(Judge)

Do you have any last words before I give you your sentence?

Third Verse:

I spent a lot of time away from family and friends
The first song I wrote, was a song named ""Revenge""
Ever since then, my weapon was a pen
But I still kept a strap for those devilish men
Sucka better duck-a from the buck, buck, bucka!
Do a fly-by and shoot your aunt and your uncle
Does anybody understand the life of the trill?

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

That you're loving someone else

Gary Louris,"Yea, there was a time I didn't like the love, I liked the climbers,
I was no sister then, I was running out of time and one liners,
And I was afraid, like you are when you're too young to know the time, and
So I watched the way you take your fear and hoard the horizon,
You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on,
Like you own them just because you bought the time,
And you turn to me, you say you hope Im not threatened,

Oh, I'm not that petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.

So now were at a club, you watch the woman dancing, she is drunk,
She is smiling and shes falling in a slow, descending funk,
And the whole bar is loud and proud and everybody's trying, yeah.
You play the artist, saying, ""Is it how she moves, or how she looks?""
I say, its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks,
And as long as shes got noise, shes fine.
But I could teach her how I learned to dance when the musics ended,

Oh, and thats not petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.

You tried to make me doubt, to make me guess, tried to make me feel like a little less,
Oh, I liked you when your soul was bared, I thought you knew how to be scared,
And now its amazing what you did to make me stay,
But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going,

And so Im leaving, you can find out how much better things can get,
And if it helps, Id say I feel a little worse than I did when we met,
So when you find someone else, you can try again, it might work next time,
You look out of the kitchen window and you shake your head and say low,
""If I could believe that stuff, Id say that woman has a halo,""
And I look out and say, ""Yeah, shes really blond,""
And then I go outside to join the others, I am the others,

Oh, and that's not easy, I don't know what you saw, I want somebody who sees me,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.",As Cool as I Am,2010
Gary Louris,"I never thought you were the letter writing type
So now I see the words you chose the way you write
So I started to write back about the trees in the snow
And I saw a bird, couldn't see what it was but I thought you'd know
You always surprised me

And if I wrote You
If I wrote You
You would know me
And you would not write me again

And when the spring came and flooded all the streams
It's like how you got the night you told me all your dreams
And when the barn roof sagged after an icy bout
It's like how you got when you knew the truth was the only way out 
But not the only way

And if I wrote you
If I wrote you
You would know me
And you would not write me again

We drew our arms around the bastard sons
We never would drink to the chosen ones
Well you know the way I left was not the way I planned
But I thought the world needed love and a steady hand
So I'm steady now

And I'm so happy
I had to tell you
And I love you

Gary Louris,"The summer ends and we wonder where we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And you both look so young 
And last night was hard, you said 
You packed up every room 
And then you cried and went to bed 
But today you closed the door and said 
""We have to get a move on. 
It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead, 
We push ourselves ahead."" 

And it was cloudy in the morning 
And it rained as you drove away 
And the same things looked different 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
When you move to another place 

And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same 
She walked alone all spring, 
She had a boyfriend when the summer came 
And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm 
They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn 
And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving 
So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves 
She held on to his sleeves 

And she doesn't want to let go 
'Cause she won't know what she's up against 
The classrooms and the smart girls 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you hang your flowers up to dry 

And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head 
It felt like the first day of school 
But I was going to the moon instead 
And I walked down the hall 
With the notebooks they got for me 
My dad led me through the house 
My mom drank instant coffee 
And I knew that I would crash 
But I didn't want to tell them 
There are just some moments when your family makes sense 
They just make sense 

So I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on 
We walked out on the dark and frozen grass 
The end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you send your children to the moon 

The summer ends and we wonder who we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree 
I passed the farms that made it 
Through the last days of the century 
And I knew that I was going to learn again 
Again, in this less hazy light 
I saw the fields beyond the fields 
The fields beyond the fields 

And the colors are much brighter now 
It's like they really want to tell the truth 
We give our testimony to the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
You can spin the light to gold.",Iowa,2010
Gary Louris,"I'm sorry that I left you 
With your questions all alone
But I was too happy driving 
And too angry to drive home

I was thinking about the easy courage 
Of my distant friends
They said I could let this bridge wash out
And never make amends

Can I blow this small town
Make a big sound
Like the star of a film noir postcard
Can I just forget the frames I shared with you

And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can change my mind
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime 

Well there are Spring Street storefront daisies
Floating on their neon stems
There are new shirts on the clothes racks
Should I feel like one of them

I can find a small apartment 
Where a struggling artist died
And pretend because I pay the rent
I know that pain inside

Yeah, let's watch the tour bus stop and tell us
Here's the scene of a spring green life dream
Take the best part
Write it in your caffeine diary

And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can leave tonight 
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime 

This year April had a blizzard
Just to show she did not care
And the new dead leaves
They made the trees look like children with gray hair

But I'll push myself up through the dirt
And shake my petals free
I'm resolved to being born 
And so resigned to bravery

Yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this
Too much rain on a prairie flood plain
Houses floating, love is like that
We built on the river

Gary Louris,"I don't go to therapy to find out if I'm a freak
I go and I find the one and only answer every week

Down any course that fits within a fifty minute hour
And we fathom all the mysteries, explicit and inherent
When I hit a rut, she says to try the other parent
And she's so kind, I think she wants to tell me something, 
But she knows that its much better if I get it for myself
And she says

What do you hear in these sounds? 
What do you hear in these sounds?

I say I hear a doubt, with the voice of true believing
And the promises to stay, and the footsteps that are leaving
And she says ""Oh,"" I say, ""What?"" she says, ""Exactly,""
I say, ""What, you think I'm angry
Does that mean you think I'm angry?""
She says ""Look, you come here every week
With jigsaw pieces of your past
Its all on little soundbites and voices out of photographs

And I say well I'm lucky, 'cause I am like East Berlin
I had this wall and what I knew of the free world
Was that I could see their fireworks
And I could hear their radio
And I thought that if we met, I would only start confessing
And they'd know that I was scared
They'd would know that I was guessing
But the wall came down and there they stood before me
With their stumbling and their mumbling
And their calling out just like me, and

Flaunting our love like a dance step mastered, turning from left to right
But after all the colored lights are gone
Time will leave the ashes and the dawn

I'm watching you go, it's like spying on hope ever onward with more to burn
Giving your hands and your heart to the weave of the world, though it fights each turn
But you do not give up so easily

A way to hang the sun up in the sky
And now I think I have it too

You rise and meet the day

And I can see kids, maybe yours, maybe not, oh oh oh,

And the clothes that we're wearing today
And they will know the true and humble power

Another date was just not right
And as I drove myself back home

Gary Lucas,"I'm lying in my bed
The blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

If only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no mojo pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't want to weep for you, don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so

Precious, precious silver and gold and pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm, screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless, I'm there in your arms

Don't want to weep for you, I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so, so, slow

The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for

Don't want to weep for you, I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow

Gary Lucas,"How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had money, I would do things my way.""
But little they know, that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind.

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old, 
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person, is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave there's no doubt.
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind mind mind, mind mind,

Staring stony into her elbow's way

Daisies after daisies, a daisy for your floor
Ah days that melt into nothing
A promise piled to the door, 
Door the door was open
There's nothing left for a boy but to hide these dreams away
All those dreams decay

Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad

Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
You got a one-way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city's aqueduct

Go!

Well the highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad

Now Tom said, ""Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me, Mom, I'll be there

Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
Look in their eyes, Ma, and you'll see me""

Gary Martin,"Hey! Give me a listen you corpses of cheer
At least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)
Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray

Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Yeah! That's nice
Yeah!

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",1968
Gary McFarland,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon","Up, Up and Away",1968
Gary McFarland,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Quanta gente existe por aí
Que fala, fala e não diz nada
Ou quase nada
Já me utilizei de toda a escala
E no final não deu em nada

Let Your sweet aroma fill my life
Rose of Sharon, show me
How to grow in beauty in God's sight

Fairest of ten thousand
Make me a reflection of Your light
Daystar, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door
Let Your word speak to me
Show me what I've never seen before

Lord, I want to be Your witness
You can take what's wrong and make it right
Daystar, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lord, I've seen a world that's dying
Wounded by the master of deceit
Groping in the darkness
Haunted by the years of past defeat

But then I see You standing near me, Lord
Shining with compassion in Your eyes
I pray, Jesus, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door
Let Your word speak to me
Show me what I've never seen before

Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited till the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Just where he'd been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms again he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms again she'll be.

There came a single warrior returning from the kill.
The spoils of war hung from his horses mane.
The bloody heads of enemies that he had freshly slayed.
They saw the face, the eyes so sullen,
could only be the young Cúchulain.
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Cities burning,
the world keeps turning.
Thunder rising early in the morning.
The son of Lugh MacEithleen knew no fear.
For just one blow at any foe to tell his end was near.
So many tried to mock this Celtic son.
They taunted and they teased him till
he slayed them one by one.
And so they came, and so they've fallen
at the hands of young Cúchulain.
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Cities burning,
the world keeps turning.
Thunder rising early in the morning.
Long ago the legend has it,
how the mighty Ulster men
battled with the King Of Connacht,
fighting to the bitter end.
No one knew what foolish reason
caused this skirmish to begin.
Was it treachery or treason,
or just the idle threats of drunken men?
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Cities burning,
the world keeps turning.

Gary Moore,"The sky is cryin` 
Look at the tears rollin` down the street 
The sky is cryin` 
Look at the tears rollin` down the street 
I been lookin` for my baby 
I wonder where she can be 
That`s right 
 
I saw my baby one mornin` 
And she was walkin` on down the street 
I saw my baby one mornin` 
And she was walkin` on down the street 
Yes, she was 
You know it hurt me so bad 
It made my poor heart skip a beat 
Here we go, play it for me 
 
I`ve got a bad, bad feelin` 
My baby don`t love me no more 
I`ve got a bad, bad feelin` 
My baby don`t love me no more, no 
The sky is cryin` 
Woh, look at the tears rolling down my nose 
 
The sky is cryin` 
Look at the tears rollin` down the street, yeah 
The sky is cryin` 
Look at the tears rollin` down the street 
I been lookin` for my baby 
I wonder where my baby can be",The Sky is Crying [*],1990
