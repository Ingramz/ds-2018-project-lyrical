Geoff Love,"You must remember this 
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by 

And when two lovers woo 
They still say I love you
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by 

Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
Man must have his mate 
That no one can deny 

It's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by 

It's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers

Geoff Love,"Give me a kiss to build on and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
 
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
Give me your lips for just a moment and my 
Imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on",A Kiss to build a dream on (from The Strip) [*],2004
Geoff Love,"I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don't want to set the world on fire, honey
I love you too much
I just want to start a great big flame down in your heart
You see, way down deep inside of me, darling
I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know, baby, ain't nobody else gonna do

I'll always stand and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two
I'll wait for you the whole night through

I want another evening with her charms
Then we will say goodbye and part

Tie to the stem a lock of golden hair

But then will come a love that's new

Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside

So I pray this time

And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent 
It wasn't much like Paradise but 'mid the dirt and all 
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today

Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues,2017

How unmoved and cold I must have seemed

And stare in icy silence?
What was I to say? What can you say
When a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away and I'm alone
With the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad, I see it still

""You know my dear
You are living inside a dream
Believing the things I do
Are what they seem
Life is a trick that runs too quick
For a volunteer from the crowd

What's been allowed""
The players practice to deceive
With paper flowers none perceive
Disappearing down the top hat corridors
Art and illusion
The magic show won't let you go
Magicians rehearse
Their sleights of hand
They slip money bags up their sleeves
They saw you in half
And then they turn to leave

By the jugglers centre stage
Carefully handed down from age to age
Conclusions made conclusions leapt
Impressions lost and overstepped
Shadows hide the truth
With nobody the wiser

Trying to make you compromise
To leave reality completely up to them

Contend with emotions under skin
Without wearing water wings

Barred in from the sunlight getting pale
And losing every sense of,

On talk shows, Oprah knows she read it in a magazine
'Cause we don't like ourselves so much
We just need to feel the touch
Of someone who'll accept us in our need

Nothing I have said or felt or done
There's nothing that can keep me from God's love
He will take me as I am
He's got a thing for runaway lambs
And there is mercy in His blood

We've got nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove
He loves us just the way He made us
And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go
He loves us just the way He made us

Everybody's talking about true success
Cashing in, psychic friends, what to eat, how to dress
But I refuse to play that game
My rules have forever changed
I will live in wonder in freedom in His rest

We've got nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove
He loves us just the way He made us
And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go
He loves us just the way He made us

He can't love you more
He won't love you less

Nothing to hide, lose, fear, or ever prove

Nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove

And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go

Geoff Moore,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,
And welcome to the Dan Rockman world stadium.
Are you ready for an afternoon of baseball? 
I hope you are, because it's Geoff Moore and the distance 
Going up against the big guy, the prince of darkness! 
It's been quite and evolution with Geoff Moore and the distance, 
That's what has brought us to the game today. 
So I want you to kick back, 
And enjoy a fun filled afternoon of baseball. 
The teams are assembled, are you ready?

(Play ball!)
The lights go on, another game day
I grab my bat and headed for the plate
But the first pitch was a curve, and I was done
(Strike one!)
I stepped out of the box, 
Looked the pitcher in the eye
You could read his lips
""Hey punk you're mine""
So I gave him a wink and said ""let's see what you can do""
(Strike two!)

[chorus]
Gotta keep my eye on the ball
Swing straight, and true, and follow through
Don't be afraid, whatever the call
Because we're never alone
Our coach is there to cheer us on
Well it's the wind up
Here comes that ball
You gotta pray and swing
Watch it till it's going, going, it's gone!
Home, home, home run
We need a home run
Home, home, home run
We need a home run

You know life can be like a baseball game
We're on the same team, but we're not all the same
That's why we got to learn to play together.
I didn't join this team to sit on the bench
I'm going deep, swingin' for the fence
I got some friends on base I gotta get home.

[Chorus]

We are not the first to play this game
Or stand over this plate
We are surrounded by the legacy
Like they're sittin' in the stands
I can see them waving their hands 
Saying ""go, go all the way!""

(It's going, it's going, it's going, home run! it's outta here! that baby is gone!)

Hey, it's a home run

Geoff Moore,"Darwin first did the imminent service of arousing attention to the 
Probability of all change in organic, as well as in the inorganic world,
Being the result of law, and not of miraculous interposition
For all life is a continuum. All living things despite their awesome diversity
Are related to each other. And evolution is the term we give to that 
Process, by which the structure of plants and animals changes with the 
Passage of time thus accounting for the continuum

I was staring through the blackboard trying to keep from sleeping,
Doing my very best to hear the subject they were teaching.
When to my surprise, I couldn't my believe my ears, 
This is what you looked like back a million years
Your uncle was a monkey, he was swinging through the trees,
He lived on green bananas, and his arms swung to his knees
He spoke with such conviction, it really made me think,
Maybe my teacher, He's the missing link!
He said...

I believe in evolution,
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
It's the only possible solution,
Big Bang fiction, that we factualize

Therefore Crow Magnum Man!
It takes a lot of faith to say we're accidents of nature,
But I believe we are the work of a loving creator
Now you can wait a million years and hope that nature does it's part,
But it only takes a moment, for God to change a heart
That's why...

I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind.
It's the only true solution,
God is always working, changing lives (changing lives),
It's evolution redefined

I used to trust in natural selection,
My survival was all I could see.
My evolving to perfection,
Started when God rescued me

I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind.
It's the only true solution, God is always working,
Changing lives.
I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind
It's the only true solution,
It's evolution redefined

Geoff Moore,"You was a baby like I was once 
Crying in the early morning 
You was born in a manger Lord 
Reid Memorial is where I was born 
They wrapped You in swaddling clothes 
Me they dressed in baby blue 

Well I was twelve years old in the meeting house 
I was listening the the old men pray 
I was trying hard to figure out 
What it was that they was trying to say 
And there You were in the temple 
They said You weren't old enough 
To know the things You knew 

Did You grow up hungry 
Did You grow up fast 
Did the little girls giggle when You walked past 
Did You wonder what it was that made them laugh 
And did they tell You stories about the saints of old 
Stories about their faith 
They say stories like that make a boy grow bold 
Stories like that make a man walk straight 

You was a boy like I was once 
Was You a boy like me 
I grew up around Indiana 
You grew up around Galilee 
If I really do grow up 
Well I want to grow up and be just like You 

Did You wrestle with a dog 
Did You lick his nose 
Did You play beneath the spray of a water hose 
Did You ever make angels in the winter snow 
And did they tell You stories about the saints of old 
Stories about their faith 
They say stories like that make a boy grow bold 
Stories like that make a man walk straight 

Did You ever get scared playing hide and seek 
Did You try not to cry when You scraped Your knee 
Did You ever skip rocks across a quiet creek 
And did they tell You stories about the saints of old 
Stories about their faith 
They say stories like that make a boy grow bold 
Stories like that make a man walk straight 

And I really may just grow up and be like You some day

Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
I wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to You

That every long lost dream
Led me to where You are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into Your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to You

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have them back again
And give them all to You
But You just smile and take my hand
You've been there and You understand
It's all part of a grander plan

Geoff Moore,"My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts with a quick turn of his wrench
And he pulled splinters from his hand and never even flinched
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that Grandpa died I realized

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think'll never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year, Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch they brought the helicopter in
Billy couldn't feel his legs, they said he'd never walk again
But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed
And the day we graduated he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over, don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless if you believe

Happen just like that

Geoff Moore,"Morning comes too early ,
And night time falls too late.
And sometimes all I want to do is wait.
The shadow I've been hiding in 
Has fled from me today.

I know it's easier 
To walk away, 
Than look it in the eye. 
But I will raise a shelter to the sky 
And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie 
She will slowly yield the light 
As I awaken from the longest night. 

Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories all rush into his head.
By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances 
She was dancing through the night above his bed.
And walking to the window 

He throws the shutters out against the wall 
And from an ivory tower hears her call 
""Let light surround you"" 

It's been a long, long time 
He's had a while to think it over 
In the end he only sees the change 
Light to dark 
Dark to light 
Light to dark 
Dark to light 

Heaven must be more than this 
When angels waken with a kiss 
Sacred hearts won't take the pain 
But mine will never be the same

His shadow slowly fading from the wall 
And from an ivory tower he hears her call 
""Let the light surround you""

Once I was but I was found.
When I heard the stained glass
Shatter all around me.
She whispers words to clear my mind.
I once could see but now at last,
I'm blind.

Fullness of God in helpless babe

Scorned by the ones He came to save

The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me

Are related to each other. And evolution is the term we give to that

A simple heart will set me free to let extraordinary things
Flow through this ordinary heart of simplicity
Let it flow through me, oh
",Simple Heart,1996
Geoff Moore & the Distance,"[Chorus]
I'm free, I'm free
I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

[Verse One]
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say
""Nothing's that simple""
But you've been told many times before
Messiah's pointing to the door
And no one's had the guts to leave the temple

I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

Is free indeed

Today I Got Your Letter
The One You Said I Never Would Read
And It Seems You've Been Through Some Weather
And You Feel Like Surrendering


Before You Commit The Crime
Before You Abandon Your Dreams
Take A Look, How The Hardest Of Times
Will Drive You To Your Knees
The Very Place You Needed To Be


Chorus
Were You Can Hold,
Hold On And Let The Wind Blow
Hold, Hold On


Verse Two
Well I Know It Sounds Too Simple
But I Beg You, Don't Be Confused
Many Times It's In The Simple
That We Find The Home Of The Truth
That We Find The Home Of The Truth


And The Truth Would Say To


Chorus
Hold,
Hold On And Let The Wind Blow
Hold, Hold On
When The World Says Let Go
Hold, Hold On
When You Feel Like Letting Go
Hold On

And When Your Hand Starts To Slip
And When You're Losing Your Grip
And When You Know Your Hope Is Gone
You're Not The Only One Holding On


Verse Three
Today, I Got Your Letter
I Was Moved By Your Honesty
And I Know You've Been Through Some Weather
Let It Drive You To Your Knees
The Very Place We Need To Be.
",The Letter,1997
Geoff Moore & the Distance,"I John 4:7-10
Well I was minding my business like a good boy should
A little too careful for my own good
It was just like living life in the dark
But then something jumped up and it grabbed my heart

[Chorus:]
And I found love
I found love
I found real love
I found love
The beginning and end of every wish
Is balanced in the center of a vision like this
Maybe my emotions are inclined
To surrender to the notion of a glorious kind

[Chorus:]
On touch, souls speak
The power's go me and it won't let me be
It's too much, this heat
I want to laugh, cry, jump for joy, shout and scream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
At the end of every tunnel there's a shining light
In the eye of every storm there's a quiet night
My joy was hidden in my dreams
I didn't know that it was there until You set me free

Repeat [Chorus:]",I Found Love,2006
Geoff Moore & the Distance,"I could make a promise to you
But that would be too easy to do
You see I've made them before
And broken them and they're no good anymore
So I'll dig a little bit deeper
Give you something you can keep 
I will make a vow to you
And it will never change no matter what I do
Right here, right now
In the midst of the crowd
I stand alone and make my vow
Whatever it takes I will be faithful 
This is my vow

As the words fall from my lips
We both know the life I live
How I stumble and fall
How many times I land short of the call
I will confess my inadequacy
Throw myself into the mystery
That somehow in the death of your love
You will help me do what I'm not capable of

Right here, right now
In the midst of the crowd
I stand alone and make my vow
Whatever it takes I will be faithful

Let the whole world know I will be faithful

""Jump in."" She says.
""High tide."" Yeah she promises.
""Dive under."" She says.
Raging water. She gives to me.

So still and silent.
Holding breath, close my eyes
And take her hand.
Feel my body surrender,
Who wants to live forever?
My feet can't touch the ground.

Should I swim for the shore?
Should I sink into the black?
Should I breathe now?
Would you?

""Jump in."" She said.
""Dive deeper you can rest all day tomorrow.""
""Hold on longer."" She begs.
""It's getting stronger."" Remember?

Should I swim for the shore?
Should I sink into the black?
Should I breathe now?
Should I breathe my last breath?

Ask yourself, why?
I feel your need of helplessness
So much I can't help myself.
Why do you need me to, save you?

Save you,
I can't let you go.
I can't let you

For a sign.

We see... what we want to see,
But only a drop of what could be.
Stop me if I'm going on...
I dream in stale complacency.
And in other words ...
Tell me you're all right.
Just a whisper and I dreamed you cry,
But I survived, courageous here ...
And in other words ...on other worlds.

And when my hands begin to bleed
Will you stay and comfort me?
I feel afraid I might be living. Yeah.

And if I had to the ends of Time
Would I ever make you mine?
Just a whispered ""yes"" is all I need.

Tasting you still on my tongue,
Shaking conch shells one by one,
And trails of peaceful inequities.
Insincere flattering by other ones
In other words ...

And when these wounds upon my brow,
Begin to seep the truth we found,
Do you feel we need to keep giving?
And if I promised the world for you,
I could make it all come true.
With a whispered ""yes"" it's all I need.

I don't know about tomorrow.
I just know, I'll remember today...
And the way... you looked at me.

If my hands begin to bleed
Will you stay and comfort me?
You looked at me.
You looked at me.

Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

And there is a meaning that will complete me

telling me that my time could be better spent.
There are complicated circumstances.
They say you belong to a better man.

Baby you're mine.
Yeah you're mine, you just don't know it yet.

Now when I'm right beside you do you ever see...
Do you see me?
And when I'm so deep inside you
will you know,
ever know me?

And when I move in you?
And I do all of those things that you want me to?
You're my world, I'm your satellite,
always free floating outside of your gravity.

When my finger tips touch your skin,
you will know.
When I whisper your secret sins
you will know.
When my finger tips touch your skin,
you will know.
When I whisper when I whisper your...
I whisper your name.

When my finger tips touch your skin,
you will know.
When I whisper your secret sins...

Geoff Young,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him","The Spirit of Man [Jerry, Doreen & Phil Acting Out-Takes]",1981

I got no more tears in me left to flow
When I did my baby wrong
She left me lonely for so long
Now I'm out here all alone
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

[Chorus: x 2]
Lord, won't you please...bring my baby home
Lord won't you please bring my baby home

It go one for the treble
Two for the bass
Used to mess with this girl
Way back in the day

She was from the pj's
And she went both ways
Yeah, the girl was a freak
I used to call her monique

And before I even speak
About knockin' the boots
I say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits
So now we gettin' down to the nitty of the gritty

She brought her friend around
And damn she was pretty
Betty was twisted
She said her number was listed

They grabbed my love two fisted
Hugged it and kissed it
They say one in the hand
Is worth two in the bush

But when shove came to push
Yo, I had my own theories
World series of love
It's two on one

'Til I got caught with the smokin' gun
His wife came home
And she bursted in
Now I'm lookin' for my heart

Like I'm made from tin
The road that I travel
Ain't got yellow bricks
My old woman jinxed

That all men are pricks
And she flipped the script
She's puttin' lip to lip
And every time I think about it I just lose my grip

'cause I've been up
And I've been down
And I've been fast
And I've been slow
And I've been square
And I've been round
And I've been high
And I've been low
And I've been cool
And I've been calm
And I've been kind
And I've been crass

I held the whole world right in my palm
I tried to spread it around
But it sure went fast

[Chorus]

Seven years sure have flown by
I got no more tears and they are left to cry
When I did my sugar bad
I lost the best thing I ever had
And now I'm out here on my own
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

but ever since I met you, child, you've made my life such hell.
With ev'ry day that passes, I fall nearer to the ground.
It seems that I've been looking for something that won't be found.
 
I was only dreaming;
I was only try'n' to catch your eye.
I was only wishing you would notice me; instead you said goodbye.
 
Could this be the new answer then to all the dreams we've made?
Could there be some solution, please, to rid me of this craze?
But ev'ry single second that you hold me in your arms.
you build me up, you raise me up, you kill me with your charms.
 
I was only dreaming;
I was only try'n' to catch your eye.
I was only wishing you would notice me; instead you said goodbye.
 
(Try'n' to catch your eye.)
Won't you stay here tonight?
Won't you make these feelings last?
Can't we start this all again?

And it's not for the sake of tryin'

You woulda seen me cryin'
So oh Lord, oh Lord
Won't You give me your hand
Won't You give me your hand

They say ?you can do almost anything?
If you really try
But this can't be right
Cause I tried both day and night
So if I'm doin' it wrong
Please, won't You put me right
So oh Lord, oh Lord
Won't You give me your hand
Won't You give me your hand

Hope I'm not askin' too much of You
Don't like really askin', but what else can I do
Oh, here I go again, I'm cryin'
The pen that I'm writin' this with is dyin'
Paper in this book sure took some buyin', Lord
So oh Lord, oh Lord
Won't You give me your hand
Won't You give me your hand

Think that's about all I have to say
So if You can do anything to help me find my way
Sure would appreciate you tryin'
'Cause life's too short and I don't wanna spend it cryin'
My ma tells me I'm a fool, but I keep on tryin', Lord
So oh Lord, oh Lord
Won't You give me your hand
Won't You give me your hand
Won't You give me your hand (oh Lord)
Won't You give me your hand (oh Lord)
Won't You give me your hand (oh Lord)
Won't You give me your hand (oh Lord)
Won't You give me your hand (give a little hand)
Won't You give me your hand (I need it so much)
Won't You give me your hand (oh Lord)

Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?
Yeah
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people's
Who said I was talking to you?

From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby

Mimi still loves you
Are you really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time

For someone who longs for a community of his own

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Will you ever know how it feels 
To be alone in this world, all alone",Bastard Son,2000
George,"You know how it feels
To roll away like a stone
And sing like a dove
That's found its way home

The filth on the ground
Or washed up on the shore
We try where they've failed
But they'll reap what they sow

And it's the passion we feel
As we run through life
I hope a time will come
When they realise
What they've done

They're shakin' it breakin' it slowly they're shakin' it breakin' it slowly

The lone CEO, chosen for his worth
To build cash-tiled walls
Above the smoke-stacked sky

But what if you never drew your breath
On a warm sun-filled day
Or caught all your dreams, in a season of
Tranquility tranquility tranquility...

They're slowly destorying
What we love
Shakin' it breakin' it slowly",Breaking It Slowly,2002
George ,"Goodbye is what she said
When she said I'm sorry
And I, I'm dying on the inside
'cause I tried but I can't hide the tears
That fall from my eyes

Hold me close one more night
Hold me close one more time
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

hello with a little wink 
But what she think of me 
And oh she smiled
Give me her name
But who would have thought I would be crying here
With all this pain no no


Hold me close one more night baby
Hold me close one more time (just give me one more time my baby)
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

Now there's nothing I can do and
There's nothing I can say
About losing you
I wish that I could find a way, wish that I could see you again
If only I could turn back time

Hold me close one more night...
Hold me close one more time.. 
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside (dying on the inside)
A butterfly....

George ,"Can't Stop Loving You Lyrics
Artist: George Nozuka


Since you let me go
Every single day seems impossible
Just can't get you out of my mind
Everything I see brings back memories
Of you and me
Left me on my knees
Even though its been hell
I'm still begging please
And I really just wanna why

babe if you're home please pick up the phone
'cause I'm incomplete.. without you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up

I know you hate girl
And I know you're only doing this to
Hurt me, girl, and I'm dying inside
Tonight, I got no other choice, I need to hear your voice
To get goodbye,
If were meant to be just thought I should be happy
And I'm saying it straight from the phone
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
Guess it is what it is I..

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you (cant stop, can't can't stop)
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up loving you

there's are times I don't know what I'm suppose to do
'cause I don't like to be alone (don?t like to be alone)
Lookin at all the pictures that I have of you
I'm listening to sad love songs
Where will I go, what will I do
Who will I be if I can't be with you
Here I stand, half a man
And I'm givng my all in my hand

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
(cant loving you, can't stop loving you)
'cause I'm all torn up baby and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up loving you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up 
(all torn up, can't give up)
(all torn up, can't give up)

No one heard the boy
Who cried himself to sleep
Didn't care about himself 'cause he
Hurt too much, he was hurt too much
And the burden of the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,
Hurting child
I sing for the hurting child
I sing for the hurting child

In the middle of the fight
No one saw the girl who thought it
Was her fault, didn't know about her pain
Though it was right there
No one said they cared
And the burden of the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,

I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Cry for the children now

George ,"I'll tell you all something man
This girl man
I used to love we was together
She left, She with this other guy
Its really blowing my mind right now
George man I gotta tell you about it

I was up in the VIP section
I've seen her with her girlfriends dancin'
With her tight blue jeans and stilettos on
I thought about our last convo on the telephone
And I said girl I'm going on a tour
I'll be gone for 4 months
So why don't we just break it on off for 4 months
She said boy if you leave you so nuts
'Cause Imma just move on
And you gonna be so crushed

Never thought I'd bump into you
With another guy under your arm
Now I know that I was a fool
Fool of my girl, fool of my girl
The whole time that you were with me
My friends said I did you wrong
And now it's easy to see
It just took too long

That was the last time
'Cause the last time
I said goodbye to you
(said goodbye to you)

You may scroll down and join the discussion
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time

You keep on blocking my calls
So now I know how it feels
And it hurts
What goes around comes around
The pain is so real
I see you two so happy
Don't know what to do (Oh)
I'm lost without you (Nooo)

It was the last time
'Cause the last time (Ohhh)
Don't wanna say goodbye (say goodbye)
Don't wanna say goodbye to you

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time

Jeah, momma said
Boy she with a keeper
But now I understand
Why I'm sick with a fever
That's why I run around
With the models and divas
Drinkin' away the pain
With the henni and tequila
If I could take it all back I would
I'd take it back to the days
Where our love was all good
When I used to have you
On the bed, legs spread
Instead, I'm listening to the words you always said

On the real
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
How I feel
Don't you know that your the only one
Last time,
I took you for granted
When you were mine
Please forget about the last time
Let's talk

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth

There she is in the club on a Friday night,

Somethin' about this girl I can't describe
But I know that I want it
In a crowded room she stands alone 
With her back against the wall 
Biggest eyes I've ever known
Yeahh

She's right were I'm walking
Every five minutes Its the second yeahh
She knows what I'm doing its no mystery to her

Just like sugar and she's higher then me

There's that girl with the softest smile 
Ain't gonna stop till the somethin's mine

And drop the somethin' somethin' on me
Drop your pants if you feel right 
Because you know were going to rock through the whole night
Drop your pants if you feel right
Does it feel right
You...
Gotta see this girl with your one two eyes
With her back up against the wall
Its the way she moves from side to side 
She's got me hipnotized
Its hard to focice 
Not to notice
When her backs up against the wall
She's all up onto me

Had an attitude, why be so rude I know just what to do

Told the girl don't act this way

You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you",Since I Fell for You,2006
George Alexander,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,2006

Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.

From the grape came the wine
From the wine came a dream to a lover

With a million stars shining above her
Once again he romanced as the kissed and they danced
And even her wedding bells chimed

From the vine came the grape

He would cry

George Anthony,"Remembering the moments 
And feeling once again the pain 
I once would have forgiven you 
But now it's much to late 
In time I strongly believe 
You and I were meant to be 
Intentions to be forever 
But time has changed everything 
You keep playing all your games 
And I, I just walk away 
Now you say your love is true 
Now that it's too late and I'm over you 

[Chorus] 
Don't look back, baby it's time to carry on 
It's too late to realize you need me after I'm gone 
Don't look back, I won't be the fool that I once was 
To ever believe that I was your only love 

At times I should have noticed 
But love made me so blind to see 
That your love was anything but true 
And only deceiving me 
I gave you all my love girl 
And in return you gave me lies 
It's not so easy to come and return to me after all this time 
You keep playing all your games 
And I, I just walk away 
Now you say your love is true 
Now that it's too late and I'm over you 

[Chorus: x2]

The only things left to say 
Are a few words of my advice 
The best thing you can do is change 
And leave all the games behind 
It's too late to say sorry 
Understand my point of view 
All the trust I had in you is gone 
There's no one to blame but
You keep playing all your games 
And I, I just walk away 
Now you say your love is true 
Now that it's too late and I'm over you

George Arus,"Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you - speak my name
Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame
Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel - with our bliss
When, two lips of coral - want to kiss

I say (that) the devil is in you, and to resists you - I try
But if you didn't continue - I would die

Lover, I surrender - to my heart",Lover,2002

Don't walk alone in grey and dark nights

There is a sun for you to shine
Lookat yourself, what do you see?
A childhood fear to be alone, maybe a heart
Without a home, but someone's waiting there for you.

Morning sky let me touch your golden sunlight
Let me dream away the dark night, let me ride
Your silver cloud, morningsky promise me you
Live tomorrow push away my pain and sorrow
In God's golden morning sky.

To trust a friend, so let your life be like a song
Sing with a feeling in your heart.

I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news---

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Dear you did something grand to my heart
And we played the scene to perfection
Though we didn't have the time to rehearse

Since you took control of my life
You have become the whole of my life
When you are away it's awful
And when you are with me it's worse

Lover, when I'm near you
And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear and breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's only trancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart

Well, I say that the devil is in you
And to resist you I try
But if you didn't continue
I would die

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart
To my heart, lover

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Finds us caught in life's most sensible trance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Old songs, a new life
And hearts that understand like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

And girl it sure feels good to know

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

George Benson,"When the picture tells it all
There's no need for trying or pretending
You whip your suitcase in the hall
It's not a time for lying, no more crying
I gave her heart that I may never see, return to me

[Chorus]
Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you

Before the pleasure turns to shame
It's a time for leaving not deceiving
And, though a promise has been made,
I would never hold you from what you need to do
You keep the years but the moments I'll keep near forever dear.

[Chorus]

I gave her heart that I may never see return to me

Every day and night
All of my life around you
I just want to hang around you

Oh I need your touch,
Can't get enough
Love Me
Oh you've got to see

I just want to hang around you

All of my life around you
Hang around you

Spending every moment of my life
Within your gaze my forever love
To have you and to hold you
So you never ever need to use
Your crystal ball
To know where I'll be, always

I just want to hang around you

All of my life around you
Hang around you

All I want to do is hang around you

I just want to hang around you

George Benson,"When the sun shines on the mountains
And the night is on the run
It's a new day, it's a new way
And I fly up to the sun

I can feel the morning sunlight
I can smell the new-born hay
I can hear God's voices calling
From my golden sky-light way

Una Paloma Blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una Paloma Blanca
Over the mountain I fly
No one can take my freedom away

Once I had my share of losing
Once they locked me on a chain
Yes, they tried to break my power
Oh, I still can feel the pain

I'm just a bird in the sky

Over the mountain I fly
No one can take my freedom away

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door

One look and I had found my future at last

She don't mean to make a scene
Like you, she feels all the weight you're under
And when she breaks, is it any wonder

I know sometimes it crosses your mind
To get on out and stay hard to find
Before you try, you'd better look in her eyes
Love is forever, stay together

I knew it had to be you

Everyday my joys are like a waterfall
Little things you do like a simple call
And my night is something like a miracle

Had a vision 'bout the river flowing me
In a clear blue sky
The way you found me
And wrapped around me
Angel you answered my cry
Wonderin' to through the search
Lonely think of it
Searchin' for the best
With the comfort of your ears

Girl this time there's no mistake
You got my heart banging
Like I lead a way
More than just sensational you are
Irreplaceable

Think I wanna make you mine
Take a vow and dedicate my love to you
You are so simply irreplaceable
Irreplaceable
Love you 'till the end of time
Promise I'll be spending all my life
Just making you happy
So irreplaceable you're all I need

There's a baby boy with your pretty eyes
And the little girl who makes the world of you

George Benson,"How could I forget what she had on
Halter top with the capri pants on
Had a smile that would stop time
And pretty feet which is a fetish of mine
Hair down to her shoulders barely
Lip gloss with no make-up surely
I wasn't gonna let her get away
Until she heard me say

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark 
So let me know 
Can I take you out tonight

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance 
For romance at least
I walk away knowing I tried my best 
And I'm going, I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say

Excuse me miss

And introduce myself to you
Cause you never gonna know 
When you're gonna find love
And hopefully I'll find it in you

George Benson,"If I cried like a baby would you change your mind?
If I told you I'm crazy would you come running back to me?
The harder I try to break away, the more I get lost in yesterday
The man that you know is just a shell, living without your life is hell

I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl, it's killing me, well

[Chorus]
I don't want to die tonight, but I think I might be going down
'Cause the only one I ever cared about is nowhere to be found
I don't want to close my eyes 'cause I might not see the light of day
I'm almost out of air
You're my reason for breathing
You're my reason for breathing

I don't want to go clubbing, I got no one to dance with me
I don't want to go shopping, I got no one to spend my money on
Spending my time with one glass of wine
Playing solitaire just to ease my mind

Poured one for you, but I drank that too
Anything to kill the pain of losing you

I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl, it's killing me

[Chorus: x3]

So I'm reaching out on this distant line
Hoping deep inside your heart's gonna find a reason
To keep me breathing
But I'm lost in this pain and I don't have much time

I'm so tired of walking this same old line
So I'm taking my pride, gonna throw it aside
Please let me breathe girl, I'm sorry

[Chorus: x2]

Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.

Put yourself in Jesus hands""

George Benson,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

George Benson,"Remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it baby
Facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are and we're growin' stronger day by day

[Chorus]
Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good to know
You're by my side
Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love to keep us satisfied every night

so my lady whisper the words I love to hear
Cuddle up and I'll make you feel all right
Cause I need you baby to carry me on through all the years
So come on baby close the door and dim the lights

and there ain't no one in this world tonight
Can change my point of view
So come on girl and hold me tight
The way you always do with love times me and you

George Benson,"Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy [Whoa, whoa]
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Money's tight, he's workin' every night
It ain't easy to keep the flame alive
And when he finally comes home to ya
He's just too tired to do the things you want to

You can't help but wonder to yourself
How would it be with someone else
Just keep in mind, every storm ends in time
Love is forever, stay together

[Stay together] When you got something real
[Love forever] That you may never feel again

Now you're the man, you've got to understand
She don't mean to make a scene
Like you, she feels all the weight you're under
And when she breaks, is it any wonder

I know sometimes it crosses your mind
To get on out and stay hard to find
Before you try, you'd better look in her eyes
Love is forever, stay together

[Stay together] You've got something real
[Love forever] That you may never feel again
[You've got a lot]

[Stay together]

George Benson,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star

I tried to write it in calligraphy
But the words wouldn't come to me
Couldn't send it in a telegram
Or sculpt it like Rodan
If I could think the words across the sky
Cause when we touch I feel like I can fly
I couldn't build another Taj Mahal
But music says it all

Guitar gently groove you
Like rain, falls down

George Benson,"You were the owner of a broken heart
You didn't know that I was falling in love from afar
Every morning, wiping tears from your eyes
You never dreamed someone was watching and heard every cry

What are the odds of a fool finding in love
It's a one in a million shot in the dark
Just when I thought there's no need holdin' on
You wrapped me in your arms and took me on a stairway to love

And that's where you'll find true emotion, dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love stairway to love

A little candlelight, a fire for two
A glass of chardonnay bring out the lover in you
Slow dancing through the night makes a picture so right
Two silhouettes framed as one in the moonlight

What are the odds of a fool finding in love
It's a one in a million shot in the dark
Just when I thought there's no need holdin on
You wrapped me in your arms and took me on a stairway to love

And that's where you'll find true emotion, dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love, stairway to love

Are you ready?
We can fly away right now to Tahiti
Pack your bags. Whatever you want
You can have, here on the stairway to love

High up where jealous fools can't break us

George Benson,"Have I told you I love you
Or has it been a while since I said I did?
Have I told you htat I care
Or have I said something I can`t face?
These are thoughts that go through my mind
To make sure that my love stands the test of time, and
When I think of you loving me
Yes, I know it`s a love that was meant to be

Standing together is you and me
Living in love is our destiny
We will be floating on like an endless sea
We will be standing together

If I took you for granted
Well, that will never ever happen again
You tought me love is an action
More than a lover, you were my best friend
You brought me to a love so new
And the joy that I feel, I owe it all to you

George Benson,"Are we really happy here
With this lonely game we play
Looking for words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anywhere
We're lost in a masquerade

Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try
To understand the reasons that we carry on this way

George Beverly Shea,"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!",How Great Thou Art,1996

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,1997

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

When other helpers fail and comforts flee

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Hold thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me...",In the Garden,2005
