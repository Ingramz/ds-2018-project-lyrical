Chiller Streeter,"I'm gonna make a change,
For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good,
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
(Starting with me!)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you want to make the world a better place)

(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your, your mind!
(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man,
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know, that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
(Ooh)
Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Come on!
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it,
Yourself!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've got to make that change, today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself
Brother
Hoo!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know I've got to get
That man, that man

(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move! Come on!
Come on!
You got to

Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Aw!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
Gonna make that change

Come on!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it

Every night in a different town every night
In another world
From here to the south seas Jamaica and back
You've been working so hard girl

So many years
So many tears have passed you by
So many miles of smiles
And still you're reaching for the sky

As you roll on baby roll on roll on baby roll on
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on singing your song
As you roll on baby roll on all night long

I hesitate to ask you this but how long has it been
From here to forever and al the way back
And you've still got the same dream
Do you ever envy the ones that made it to the top
When so many tell you that you'll be the next tel me
What in the world's
Held you up

So many years
So many tears have passed you by
So many miles of smiles
And still you're reaching for the sky

As you roll on baby roll on roll on baby roll on
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on singing your song
As you roll on baby roll on all night long

Chilliwack,"People run like tired lemmings headed for the sea
Borders of imagination keeping them from seeing things
Ancient guards in greying fortresses of old ideas
Standing guard on treasure that has long since
Disappeared from use

Oh we have got to find something better
Oh people we got to find something better

People run like tired lemmings they don't see the sun
Shadow pictures drive them on and keep them on the run
Knights in blazing armour stand upon a nearby hill
Shafts of gleaming light held high and no one sees them
Still

Oh we have got to find something better
Oh people we got to find something better

Long ago and far away the words ring like a bell
Stories poems books and songs have used these words and
Use them still
Long ago and far away is where most of us dwell
Time has chased us all away and left today under its
Spell

And while you're relaxin', I take action

Never stop, I workaholic
Like spit sweat splatter Jackson Pollock
But I'm not an artist, I just work the hardest
I beat it to a pulp, just ask Jarvis

Studio to studio, I drink juice,
Produce tons of new shit, like a booty hole
Show to show, full throttle, backstage,

I just try to enjoy the grind

Underground, underdog, underrated
Under stress, under pressure, under-appreciated
Man, this is war
Where careers get killed and that's not a metaphor, like

My mindset is military, like
My attitude is Hitchcock, very scary
Persistence, instincts,
Go the distance, prove my existence

I just do it in a different way
I'm kind of sort of indirect ricochet,

And make flops like floppy disks

Groupie go home, you can find another guy
Man, music is a joke, I try not to cry

Sounds crazy, but the underground's lazy
Maybe just a bunch of big babies
And they're crying 'til they're on the guestlist,
Then they puke at 6 am - English breakfast

See I always hatch a new scheme
No room for the club or a pub in my routine
I don't judge you if you're part of a true scene
But me? I could be anywhere - blue screen

At the Grammys getting nominated
Or trying to be a piano playing Larry David
Flirting with rap, workin' for Birkin
Behind your favorite singer I just might be lurkin'

And I'm certain when they close the curtains
My life will be a B-movie shot by Tim Burton
And if I lack authenticity
Remember authenticity is often shitty

So please, no pity,
You can never melt this ice-cold heart between my two titties
'cause what's life but a board game?

Chilly Gonzales,"You came to me 
Last night in a dream 
Through the dark 
Hand to heart

You touched my face, electric scar 
I ask you why, but there's no voice
Just a look in your eye

Then the sun breaks through
I'm awake without you
How cruel this mind
To say goodbye twice

Leave me alone,why come to me 
Just to leave, a cage no key 
I crave the dark, I close the blinds 
And force my mind

How I will wait
Oh how I will wait
For this bitter sleep to come
So this dream will care

Last night I had a dream that I woke up screaming
Only to realize that I was still dreaming
Nothing good comes to those who wait
Nothing ever comes 'til it comes too late

Chimarruts,"Bom dia meu amigo,
O sol já se acordou.
A alma se renova,
Um novo dia despertou.
Amanheceu um lindo dia,
Da mais pura alegria.
Na árvore os pássaros cantam,
No céu as nuvens dançam.
O lindo azul do céu
Agora já se pode ver,
E num perfeito sincronismo
A lua vai se esconder.
Alguns são privilegiados
E acordam para trabalhar.
Mas outros tão desesperados,
Quando é que isso vai mudar.
São sinais de um novo dia,
Mas você diz ser normal.
Não deixe que na sua vida
O dia seja sempre igual.
Porque o sol chegou
Você acordou
Chegou para iluminar.
Hoje é um novo dia
Para quem quiser mudar.
Se há fé
Na sua vida,
Há fé no seu coração,
O sol lhe enviará
Sua boa vibração.
Chimarruts haga mufh
Vai mostrar para você
Que entre o céu e a Terra
O firmamento é você.
Tenha fé na sua vida,
Na paz do seu amor,
Pois agora é outro dia
E o sol já se acordou.
É, eu só quero te dizer:
Amor, paz, felicidade!
É eu só quero dizer pra você:
Amor, paz, felicidade!",O Sol,2004

Chimène Badi,"Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew
How to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down

Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
""Do you really want to know"", she said
It would seem she's on her way
It's more, more than just a dream
She put on her stockings and shoes
Had nothing to lose, she said it was worth it

Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
""Every winter was a war"", she said
""I want to get what's mine""

Jezebel, Jezebel
Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try show her a better way
She'll say, ""You don't know what you've been missing""
By the time she blinks you know she won't be listening

""Reach for the top"", she said
""And the sun is gonna shine""
""Every winter was a war"", she said

Un sentier dans la montagne

Des discours interminables
Après le déjeuner

And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
My clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream
All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's
And I had to fix a goodie bag and make decisions and haste
'Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste
So let's get looney up on the set cause I got five on the fire
Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer

Lookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and
Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something
That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'
My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken
Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues
And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes
Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors
In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest
And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest

I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
'Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm
Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn
I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed
I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said

Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends
Today you see and then you cruise through the West end
They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia
Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older
If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times
I got em' all in check, when it comes to bustin' rhymes
Don't sweat the technique cause I just move the crowd
My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride

[Chorus]

See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road
I heard the squad was wiped up, so I flipped my mode
On my way to d-e-cee, baby can't you see
That Decatur is totally to be	b-i-g for thee
Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners
It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down
They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound

Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked
I should be gettin' it, 'cause life is too got damn short
And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto
Back to the see-P, I put the pedal to the metal
God bless the child that's just got his own
Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home
I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road
It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride

[Chorus]

Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail
Say it again
'Cause it's the A-T-L
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail",Midnight Train,2000

Been to chance I pour my trust
Delicious phases gorgeous touch

Ashen is a wilderness
Towards roundness is my glance's gaze

Acting wild and drinking up
Apples we were eating of
Seasons they was fleeting us
And making plans and meeting up

Stick through the sheets are your arms and see don't be alarmed

'Cause I be droppin' the bomb that's 'cause I'm in the beyond

I never did believe you, you covered it so well
And if you ever get a life, I hope that it's in hell
I wish that I could kill you, I'd slit your ugly throat
I'd wrap you up in concrete and throw you from a boat

Oh no, oh no
Oh no

It's not that simple, it never was that simple, it's not that simple

You push me on much further, I'm gonna lose my head
And if I focused with my eyes, I'd probably see red
You'll never feel my anger cause it happens far too quick
I'll open and I'll close up but you won't feel a prick

Thought that I could sort it out, tell you what I knew
Tell you what I thought about, think I tell you

You say I'm being nasty, you haven't seen the worst
I get up to my old tricks and that'll really hurt
I know that you'll be waiting, picking up on threads
Of faking information that's growing in your head

China Edelman,"The earth can shake, the sky come down
The mountains all fall to the ground
But I will fear none of these things
Shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

Dark waters rise, the thunders pound
The wheels of war are going round
And all the walls are crumbling
Shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

(Shelter me)
Hide me underneath Your wings
(Shelter me)
Hide me deep inside Your heart

In Your refuge cover me
The world can shake
But, Lord, I'm making You my hiding place

The wind can blow, the rain can pour
The deluge breaks, the tempest roars
But in the storm my spirit sings
When You shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

(Shelter me)
Hide me underneath Your wings
(Shelter me)
Hide me deep inside Your heart

In your refuge, cover me
The world can shake
But, Lord, I'm making You my hiding place

Now on the day You call for me
Someday when time no more shall be
I'll say, oh, death where is your sting?
You shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

And I know where we are and I know who I am

Every time you smile for me
Takes me a while to bring myself back
'Cause you're all that
And I just had to let you know
That I'm screaming out in the crowd for you
I can't be too loud but I don't care
I let 'em all stare
I just want everyone to know

You showed up and you looked so classy
Made me think twice 'bout the way I was acting
You were real from the start of it all
Like a dream came to life, now I'm left in all

Love flies but your love is the highest
You're so sweet that it drives me crazy

Chinchilla,"Chorus (Porsha & Anita) 
 I want my freedom, full freedom, full freedom, mmm, hmmm x2 
 Verse 1 
 As I look in the mirror I see the picture gettin clearer 
 On the rip of this straightest of the life that I live 
 But uh I see em comin before they approach 
 Just like a stafty slot until you circle with hope 
 I maintaining on your legendary dreams and stack 
 Making million dollar moves with many platinum plaques 
 Negotiate your freedom, you catchin CRP 
 From the court from blue, come many nights no sleep 
 What's the scenerio of life when you trapped in crime 
 My lil homie still incarcerated for packing a nine 
 Now history repeat itself, there's black on black 
 Check my backround, there's evidence just hide it's back 
 Eliminate all my foes, we run violent thrusts 
 Excuse me for my crime but in God I trust 
 Bossalinie uneffected by the eyes of even 
 Cause I'm military minded and demand my freedom 
 (Chorus) 
 Verse 2 
 Record labels try to sign for many years infact 
 Want a life time commitment, get you hooked like crack 
 independent, black owned, you can keep your deal 
 I remain with No Limit cause the tank be real 
 I lose my cousin eight years for the time he spent 
 The penetentary is full of black violent, meant 
 Try to make a change, they can't 
 Cause they cuffs to tight 
 Momma please help us cause my mind ain't right 
 It ain't easy being me with my skin so toned 
 The mother land ain't been the same since they took me from home 
 My mobile phone in the benz, gettin high with my friends 
 Rainy days got us fighting each other, digging our graves 
 A cell block full of pictures, can't wait for parole 
 I need a second change of life cause I'm getting to old 
 And it's cold I can't see, can't sleep at night 
 Like a rebel for my freedom, I'll be prepared to fight

Lived a girl without hair
She's the child of the nuclear blackout
After war she was born

No chance, no hope, no livin'
In this desperate world
Just pain and tears and fire
For the girl without hair

Tears, they?re only tears
There' s nothing to live
And nothing to love

True
The spokesman told and it will be, they fight for holy
War

15 minutes time to go or for their last show
This would be the end of all. The devil's leave the
Hall

The stars will fall from the sky. The sun will never
Rise
The deepest night will reach the throne after rockets
Proclaim the war

The preachers told it years before, the generals
Blinding the masses
Their hail their bombs and their saints, the nuclear
Power that's their force

Holy evil fighting force

The war machine is coming
For their power and the glory
This should be the right time
And the place, where it will be
The war machine is coming
For their money and their blood
'Cause peace is now falling
And death ruled on earth like God

I saw them clean this planet now with fire and their
Force
To create their holy human kind only under their
Control

Cold sweat is running down my neck. The TV spokesman
Tells about

The first nuclear attack

Chinchilla,"After all these years I was ready to open my heart
I thought we were so close, but now we are miles apart
I know, nothing is for granted with the things called love
Sometimes it hurts so much, is it really a gift from above?

I'm not so sure, sometimes it's hard to understand
It only seems obscure

And now you don't pay any attention to any word I say
And all the colours around me are fading into grey
Maybe I was too sure, but it's still hard to understand
It seems so obscure

Sometimes I feel like a satellite alone on my way
Sometimes I feel like a satellite in outer space with an aching heart
Sometimes I feel like a satellite I've got nothing more to say
Sometimes I feel like a satellite somewhere out in the dark

You wrote me letters in which you've tried to explain
But I'm sorry the feeling that remains is still only the pain
You want me to be your friend, but I don't know if I'm able to
For the moment it seems too hard, because I still feel too much for you

I don't know, maybe there will come a time, But for now

Is there anybody out there maybe just another satellite
Is there anybody out there who leads me through the darkest night
Is there anybody out there who deserves to heal my broken heart
Is there anybody out there I can put my trust in right from the start",Satellite,2003

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine

Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew 

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now

Chingo Bling,"It's like this and like that, the hood got my back
Yeah I'm makin paper stacks, slangin masa like crack
Yeah I'm makin paper stacks

They said you've never been caught, boy you must be lucky
But don't go parkin by my tires, you better hush puppy
They never catch us all, it'll never stop
Any time, any corner, baby I'm a set'up chop
As long as that trunk go pop, as long as that trunk open
I'm a steady be served and boy my hustle bone aint broken
Flip it, flip it, flip it more that burger king
We use this distribution, we be servin thangs
The work is smuggled in my big belt buckle
The border got the feds, but we the underground tunnels
We pack the back, two trucks on the road
So if they stop the first one, we lose half the load
Systema, got ostrich seats in my beama
I'm reppin for my people, you can put that on selena
And right now they got us cleanin up katrina
Yo kanye!, bush don't like mexicans eitha.

It's like this and like that, the hood got my back
Yeah I'm makin paper stacks, slangin masa like crack
Yeah I'm makin paper stacks

Stacks, rubberband them, tamales I still sell them
So next year, I can pull up in a brown phantom
Them boys can't stand him, cause he too too flashy
Went from ashy to classy, to down right nasty

Slabs on driveway, that make em say ay wey
Catch you on the highway, pendejas from the myspace
Mouth wide open, tounge hangin like a pervert
When they see the wrist, Skittles chain lookin like some churbert
I sold the masa just to see how the paper feel
David Copperfield, couldn't have copped a better record deal.

Lately, I've been havin rich people problems
I made another couple million, hopin that will solve'em
Promise, lookin to reject your favorite rap star
Willy's chain, Paul's grillz, puffs house to Slim's car
They lookin at me like where the fuck they found them
Whoever the fuck signed them, I bet that they gon fire'em
But it's official, big chile slash asylum
You know the three digits, bitch you better dial'em.

It's like this and like that, the hood got my back
Yeah I'm makin paper stacks, slangin masa like crack
Yeah I'm makin paper stacks

DTP we got them guns that go

Yea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer
Niggaz recognize my name, I dub the young dealer
You better tell ya man that with the gauges I'm nice
Ill shoot up y'all white shirts until y'all look like dikes
But I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggas
I 2-0, I'm like J-Lo...going through niggas
DTP we ain't plying if you try to get our pen
A.K's get ta spraying like,
Bottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it
Bust you in the broad day, on the street that's fully crowded
Find our hole and fagots there, just for thinking its rap
And tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree
So you should what you saying if it's intended for me
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking
And that oozy get to talking like

Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em
Can the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em
Press him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up
Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up
A-B-C-E-F shawty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle,
And I'm throwing text like a NBA ref
I got, all gold guns like they came from Iraq
Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
And ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'ma click
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm webbing choppers like helicopters
You goin' need hella doctors, when the glok go

Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip that text be quick
20 over there, Tity over there, Luda over there, ain't no exit trick
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks
Reload with the next clip, I'm the ro nigga to flex with bitch
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click
My pistol grip sound like this, now what
Who want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust
Y'all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Y'all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
I'm wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone
So there for you should invest, in a vest for ya dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Beast the nick, but my cannon go

Fuck a medic, we goin' call yo ass a taxi cab
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time on the month
A.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
Got killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit
Ill pay your cab back with the black mack
Till your back crack, got the gat back like, clack, clack, clack
Swallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber
Yo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar
I, do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
My Shotguns are cold and hard, but my Desert is easy
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me
And for these fakers talking greezy, I'm starting the show

Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

From the leg down
He..is..here

Don't be scurred now
Got it made now
Just pray to God I don't get you

[Verse 1 - Chingy]
Back slap that ass
Clap that ass
Dropping body bags
Glocks and mags
Four blocks you fast
Talk your trash (Drop you fast)
Never jock a cat
I will blast
Shot is stacked
Rock your hair
Watch my mirror
Stocking caps so I watch my style
Cock and grab
Open up shop and draft
Quarter bags all of that
Water lasts shorter halves
Have ya comin back cause I'm fourth of stash
Extort the hash
Extort the wrath
Cope the past
Brought my mags
Sort my cash on the docks
Flock a hop
Keep it in a proper spot
Adopt a cop
Rob a spot
A lot of ice a cop or not
Drop a pot
Slide a lot
Jackpot a lot
Already got a lot of wine, but not in my ride, I'll stop

[Chorus] - 2X

We..are..dangerous
He'll mangle us
Who playing with us?
And saying this stuff?
And fuck with gangs and stuff?
I aim to bust
You straight up tough
No thanks to us
We're famous, duh
A game I love
To train my sluts
To give brains and cuss
Learn pain and plus
Get tricks to claim the bust
Think they nuts
Slurp them up
Hook or work them up
Wake them up, break them up
Taking crust shake them up
Make it stuck in your twat
Hit the streets, bend the blocks
Sin or not, hit the daily spot
Gin or scotch, top notch
On my roster
Mobster eating pasta
Chop her in the closer, crack her like a lobster
Have my ho to rob you
Then dodge you
Any ho need work?  I got a job for you
Go see the supplier
Make like you a buyer
Then buy slut, trick these fake playas
Often what they say, you'll buy em up messiah
Wait and bring it bacj to my empire
Chingy keep these heffers on the strip and on fire
Try her

Peeps call me up, said it's a hotel party
Just bring the liquor; there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way); let me stop by the store
Get a twelve pack of Corona plus a ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 2-7, need a natural graze road
I'm already blowed; hit third, I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet lookin' like he in the game and must be winning
To room four-nine-O I'm headed; on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like ""wassup""
I told 'em: ""follow me"" 
They knew I had it cracking, B	
One said, ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Yeah, that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit' much ding-a-ling.""
Knock on the door; I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then; feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in here; I heard 'em whispering
Talking 'bout ""that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr'; he glistening.""
I ain't come to talk (talk), I ain't come to sit (sit)
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon' hit; aww, shit

Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom, seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said, ""can I be in yo' video?"" 
I'm like ""yeah!"" Oh really?
Now she naked, strip teasing; me, I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G bring the camera
Then I thought about no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit' some girls lookin' like they from an island

Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender vittles
Doctor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D,"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit' no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle down the beat wit' a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

Gang of cats banged ya, that's why I diss ya

Now you want me to play Sugar Daddy all wit ya
Crazy as a mental patient in a wheelchairr
Take that weave out, and go get some real hairr
Let's play Truth or Darre
Is it true that you gave head in a phone booth
Girl that shit ain't you, but oh, you don't carre
When I'm out I see you sharre
I don't want to fuck, I want to get in them pockets
But first I gotta G, ain't too fairr

Never delt wit pressure pimp, I retire don't never simp
Girls talk, dudes do it, I ain't herre to impress a chick

It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank of America
I'm with my son cashing a check, so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world or fly, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, momma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever starts
So I zoomed off thinkin' bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say

(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin' off, tryin' to dunk, tryin' to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said

(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

You dealin' with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya

But them the kind I put in a place like a child
Don't worry be happy and smile

The club be packed, Hey, send me a bottle of that
It's hella ass, some with glitter and exotic tats
You know my stats, superfly, MAC
I'm in the back getting worked by this girl named Cognac, matta fact
I want to take her home, the reefer got me in the zone
Intentions to bone, we all alone, by ourself
This ain't a strip club, but she act like it
Ever seen her, bowling pins dawg, she stacked like it
Now I'm at the bar, chicks treating me like a star
In my face, asking questions, and can they ride in my car
I'm law, so authorities can't pin me for shit
Hey baby, see me and you, we can pack it up and split
Let's go, forget Motel 6, we can go to the Mariot
I see it in her eyes, man a girl getting very hot
I'm packing like a 357, so I keep magnums
Keep it real, cause you will never find out if you don't ask em, Is we tagging?

[Chorus]

If your ass is fat and you know it, clap your hands
Wearing those pants, I'll be damned if I'm iss my chance to advance
I'm in a tan, what's the name, I own some whatchamacallits
They keep spinning and spinning, hey man, What do you call it?
Got a 1-5 jersey, on the go with them wheels
Look at it wiggle wiggle, she say it's all in the heels
You a damn lie girl, I think it's all in the skills
And for real, I think you practicing on what pay the bills
You be confused man, I look picky as hell
Never trust a big butt, that smile like Ricky Bell
What the hell?, Murphy rather pay to get out of jail
Cause if she tell me to pay, somebody better pay my bail
Matta fact, I'ma pay myself, my own money
Mr. long money, even after I loan money
I own honey's mentals man, I'm in they mouth so much
God damn, I pay for dental plans, man

[Chorus]

Get it, get it girl, it's your world, I'm a squirrel, (squirrel)
Searching for a nut, so more than scissors I cut, (cut)
You can be a slut (slut), hoochie lady, or housewife, (wife)
A real man gon' want to hit it, it's hanging out, right? (right)
Ladies don't get offended, when he tell you that you're thick, (you are)
And he wouldn't mind coming over about six
If you like the smooth, let him, you don't dig em? Don't sweat 'em
You want 'em? Play like your panties and t-shirt and let 'em wet 'em

Hey yo, my ladies come in  Dueces like  Staley  and  McAllister
Came up with the 'Tics, they help me not fall like banisters
Sammy Sosa's got traded for Ken Griffey's
And when we roll, the L's stay lit, like Missy
Plus I stay busy, like kids, I call  it biz
And if it is what it is, I'm on your head like wigs
I'm a rapping Taye Diggs, I give the women they groove back
When it comes to the wood, I'm the best man to use that

Get clout when I'm out, money what I'm all about
In a world that's so shady
Peep this streetness, never had a weakness
Peep this, I do this daily
Follow my whole set, bottles of moet
Bet until they lay me
Six feet in the dirt, I'm the one with the work
Got hits but they try to spray me

Cold with the flow, dro when it goes

Until she was ontop of me, backseat of the six
It's goin down round these parts

It's hella ass, some with glitter and exotic tats 
You know my stats, superfly, MAC 
I'm in the back getting worked by this girl named Cognac, matta fact 
I want to take her home, the reefer got me in the zone 
Intentions to bone, we all alone, by ourself 
This ain't a strip club, but she act like it 
Ever seen her, bowling pins dawg, she stacked like it 
Now I'm at the bar, chicks treating me like a star 
In my face, asking questions, and can they ride in my car 
I'm law, so authorities can't pin me for shit 
Hey baby, see me and you, we can pack it up and split 
Let's go, forget Motel 6, we can go to the Mariot 
I see it in her eyes, man a girl getting very hot 
I'm packing like a 357, so I keep magnums 
Keep it real, cause you will never find out if you don't ask em, Is we tagging?

They keep spinning and spinning, hey man, What do you call it? 
Got a 1-5 jersey, on the go with them wheels 
Look at it wiggle wiggle, she say it's all in the heels 
You a damn lie girl, I think it's all in the skills 
And for real, I think you practicing on what pay the bills 
You be confused man, I look picky as hell 
Never trust a big butt, that smile like Ricky Bell 
What the hell?, Murphy rather pay to get out of jail 
Cause if she tell me to pay, somebody better pay my bail 
Matta fact, I'ma pay myself, my own money 
Mr. long money, even after I loan money 
I own honey's mentals man, I'm in they mouth so much 
God damn, I pay for dental plans, man

Plus I stay busy, like kids, I call it biz

It was weird how we met, huh 
She was wit her mom in Bank America 
I'm wit my son cashin the check 
So I asked outta respect (uh) 
Would she like to explore the world or buy 
We can fly in my jet 
Her reply was ""Yes, can I ask you sumpin?"" 
I seen it in her eye, mama lookin like all I wanted was sex 
Scene moved to the next (that is true) but it was something 
about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets 
We started off casual; walks through the park 
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinkin smart (smart) 
Of course she might think I'm in a rush 
To touch, clutch and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff 
Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk 
Conversate about political subjects whatever's thought 
So I zoomed off, lookin by and my phone rang 
It was her in the shower, (she said) she said ""I couldn't do without ya"" 
Then I said. . . 

[Chorus: J/Weav & (Chingy) 4x] 
(You, could, roll, wit, me) 
You call if you wanna bump over me 
(If you was my baby) 
I'm only one call away 

[Chingy] 
The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball 
Here she comes wit her friends they posted up on the wall 
Now I'm showin off, trynta dunk trynta dribble break fast 
Through the middle just to see her smile and giggle 
Game over I punched her wit a kiss on the cheek 
The homeboys lookin at me sayin ""Lil Howard you weak"" 
But you know how that go, what I got they want 
What I got I flaunt, never mess wit it, PLEASE don't 
Told her ""I'm going home"" she asked can she go too 
I'm like ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you"" 
Got thurr, I took a shower jumped out she in the bed 
With a see-through thong said I looked at her and said. . . 

[Chorus: J/Weav & (Chingy) 4x] 
(You, could, call, me) 
You call if you wanna bump over me 
(If you was my baby) 
I'm always one call away

Girl recognize game, before game recognize YOU 
You're dealin wit a player, TRUE 
Now whatchu wanna do? 
We can kick it and go puff on a bluuunt 
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of Hen' then we can get druuunk 
It's up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know 
Cuz if you got an attitude I could treat you just like a hoe 
Get to rollin wit me baby, hop in there's enough room 
We can gaze at the stars that shine like the moon 
Gimme a chance to show ya, and a chance to know ya 
Just be true, and there's nothing I won't do, for ya 
Some women like to play it foul (foul) 
But them the kind I put in the place of a child (child) 
Don't worry be happy and smile and. . .

I'm a bad block crook out hurr runnin' wild
'Bout to run up on your ass Tommy gun style
Call me One-eyed Willy since I sleep with my clothes
Make money with my partners as I murder my foes

In all black clothes like the Grim Reaper
It's G.I.B. and I'm my brother's keeper
Richie Rich will chop his fingers with the axe
These trick-ass cowards should be wearin' tampax

What ya think this is, huh, a lifetime story
Man, I'm knockin' cowards off of my riders before me
Lay it down, muthafucka and quit bumpin' your gums
Ain't no peace in the slums just bums and crumbs

Increasin' my change to an impeccable range

That you can't reach, if you listen I'll teach
Of course I'm a beast on them tracks I release
Whether East or West, I'll envision a check
That my show pay, I'm a predator, hey

So where's my prey 'cause it's possible for me to be poppin' today
I'll keep rockin' the [Incomprehensible] in the home of your place

Money's my mission but the way I live ain't no guarantees
Just visions of casualties sworn to municipalities
Got 'em after me 'cause a coward chose to speak on how I'll eat

But I don't play when it comes to my meat
Like The Isley Brothers leave 'em layin' between the sheets
See we Get It Boyz and know we roll with the heat

'cause these bad block niggas take no prisoners at war times
Respect mine, I'll have Guerrillas kickin' in your door time

We're deep with the artillery, impose on your spot
Plenty G's, plus, a silly G, I'll get your ass knocked
Ridin' in a minivan, contraband in my hand
Find these buzzards, split their wig that is my master plan

I don't start it but I finish it a true gun blazer

Me and Chingy got the pop charts on lock,
But I still get respect on my own block.
Niggas try to take my money, but I bounce back,
Three cribs, one viper, and a Maybach.
I'm like, baby, you can call me the birdman.
But I'm the boss, I don't hustle on the curb, man.
Now everybody in my crib got a clover chain,
So even when I'm not around, they promote the name.

I'm a cook it in the kitchen for the price of the room.
I've got black diamonds, quarter million biller on shore.
On a white sandy beach with kickers and whores.
Said I'm on another level that you can't afford:
Princess cuts, round diamonds, and getting more.
That's why I shoot my dice four thousand or more,
Cause my price at work sure be on soar.
That's why we need a hundred grand for at stores,
Cause I won't settle for nothing less than more.

So if I touch her right thurr aint no need to get mad
I could take you from the club to paradise
Used to my chicks, I like them thick
Plus naughty and nice
The way you sweep me off my feet, you should be a broom
The way you smell, should of had your own perfume
So knock knock, who's there? Jackpot (that's hot)
Ran with the old head so fuck the sex
Do it tickle when I lick your neck?
Better get you wet
Lookin' at your sexy ass make me wanna write a check

Chingy,"One day I was chillin' on Araabie and spruce
Forty in my hand and it's time to get loose
Got my Nikes, Fila t-shirt, and black khakis
I heard a horn blowin' and I jumped in my jacket
John was chillin' in the passenger seat
Stepped up out the car and started dancing in the street
Now John was lookin' fresh and it wasn't no joke
He had on some fresh khakis and was sportin' some Locs
Some gangstas poppin' wheelies came up from behind
He got off throwin' up his favorite gang sign

Here come Little Snub, from the Maple block
Groovin' on the handlebars, ready to rock
And now my posse's gettin' bigger, 'cause of all these niggas
I got the .38 and I'm about to pull the trigger
Looked up at the corner and who did I see?
Wayne and his little man Pop and Nookie
Now Sha came rollin' up on a little scooter
Lookin' for a match so he could light the Thai huddha
I told him I didn't have it, but yet I went to grab it
I lit it up and hit it up, and now I'm draggin' it

Wayne took a hit, Pop took a puff
Nookie started chokin' and now he's fucked up
The forty-ounce is hittin', so I busted into school
I'm never gettin' sweated 'cause I'm just too cool fool
Sun's goin' down and now it's night
My posse's cold chillin' and we're feelin' alright
We heard a lot of noise and it sounded like a rally
Boomin' ass sounds comin' out of Sherm Alley
We all jumped up and we started to stroll
A young nigga like the Quiksta was takin' control

The D.E.A. posse so deep we walked three twos
Now if you want to join then you gotta pay ya dues
We got up to the alley and everything was chill
They was just makin' that dollar dollar bill
Reesa came down and she sat on the stairs
I stood up 'cause I didn't have a chair
Now Pop said, ""Yo! Let's get some cuts
Get that Old 8 so we can get fucked up""
Now I'll put a twenty H put a 10 
And said, ""Fuck it! Super soca and gin""

Now everybody's gettin' in the twilight zone
Head up stairs and they're gettin' weirdo
Gangsta's on the steps and he's tryin' to bang
No belt in his khakis so his Lee's could sag
Here comes Stick with a twenty dollar bag
But he can't roll a joint 'cause he ain't got no zigzags
I looked up at my watch, it said 10:28
You better run up to the liquor store before it's too late
He went to the store and he got the zags
He came back walkin' with my homeboy Cash
Sucka came over he was lookin' for a ride

Runnin' from the police, he ain't have no place to hide
A smile came on my face when I swallowed my beer
I'm chillin' like a villain and I got no fear
Now Tony Lane came he said he was bored
Eatin' on some chips that he got from the store
I said I'm bored too, so what's up with that?
Wayne said ""Is anyone down to jack?""
Now I can get the AK and you can get the pump
But I don't want no deuce-deuce, 'cause I ain't no chump
Now Mike said, ""Dane which one do you choose?""

""I could take the .38 and you can have the Uze""
But before we can jet and be on our way
Some niggas rolled up and they was ready to spray
Rollin' real slow, they turned off the lights
Waitin' until the time was right
A fool jumped out all dressed in Guess?
(Yeah) shot him in the chest
The niggas tried to jet, but the couldn't get far
'cause Mike had the uzi and he aimed it for the car

Now that's how it's done and we do it good
Just another day in my loked out hood

I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

See the star was born.
Don't think nobody notice.
Goin' through these trials and tribulations kept me on focus.
Tried to do a 9-5, but where's the money?
Coming to work damn near bumming, 
people thinkin' it's funny (ha ha).
I'm fed up.
Plus my homies sellin' crack doin' good.

Now I'm on the block pumping rocks toting glocks.
Grand-mama on my head, I'm ducking and dodging the cops.
All cause I'm trying to make a living (living).
Consequences of that,
End up dead or in prison, ain't shit given.
I done struggled too long not to floss and get on.
I'ma get it with the double, if not the microphone.

And the government ain't doing shit for my residence.

Plus I'm praying but they breaking down in tears.
See now that I'm on, people think money make you proud.
But I've been struggling trying to come up since I was a child.
Who are you to judge me for my sins and what I did wrong.
I'm trying to live don't my mama singing a sad song.

Rolled up some of that sticky

Did a 100 to the pad, had to stash the toast
Pulled into the driveway
Hopped out and opened the door

But all the real players know
Got inside, said she's cold
So I turned the heat on
Persian rug on the floor
To wipe ya feet on

Ain't got no woman,

So we got in the Jacuzzi

Everything goin' be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

Walkin' to house from hard work, my head hurts
Instead of arguin', can I have dinner with some dessert? (Uh uh)
She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Hey, give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fightin', let me leave
I'm exhausted and this her, I don't need
Now I'm wit' the fellas, ridin' and drinkin'
She's blowin' my two way up, but I need some time for thinkin'
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin' naw
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do?
Look, let me ask y'all
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed
But it happens some time
It's either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man
Guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like
Damn!

All the fellas know you feel me, if you ever had a woman
Good times led to bad times and you ain't see it coming
Try your best to make her happy
But it wasn't enough
'Cause mama told me in relationship to road get tough
And I don't wanna have my head down
Weak and stressed out
As bad as it hurts, I gotta move to the next round
(Uh) I thought I was her man
Guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like

We don't die, we multiply 'cuz there's a strength in numbers, baby
So I brought some of my family members here today
To talk to y'all about celebrity chicks
So Ching-a-ling, why don't you go ahead
And start this thing off for, what up?

From the moment she wake up, so Hollywood puttin' on her makeup
Can't save her but it's always a fool to keep her caked up
You ask the chick out, tike the say where you gon' take her
And see the, to Vegas or Cali to see the Lakers

She brought that paper, getting over on Cat's major
This at the Billboard's I seen for real name in the pager
Say what, most of these balls they can't fade her
She stay fly, Dolce Gabbanna and Marc Jacobs

You can catch a Melrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

She got a loan and can't pay the rest
So she got another brother writing a check
I'm talking if she want it bad enough, she will get it glad enough
She can run it, run it at the same time standing in place

And got a long list of giving me
And who will be buying tables man, I'm out of here
But it's to late now, she can see I'm paid now
That I can make it rain now, say now I think I lost a girl

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

I see some celebrity chicks everywhere that I be
Everywhere that I've been, the selection or celebrity chicks to see
I see Meeg and I see Mia, I be wantin' to meet 'em
I can see them in the sheets when I imagine me between 'em

I'm straight up off the streets the MC
And I've been waiting to see Heaf
So I could shred it to him rough ride
And I leave it to the back seat of the Beamer

And hear that heatin' and give lil' mama the reason
To send papa to a region, as hot as a pot steamin'
I wanna be the secret that me and Trina keepin'
I'm hood enough for the girl I keep and every toe I Keisha

Good lord Jesus, she can go and pet the jeezer
I just want it for the weekend
I got the power to be 'bout it, I'm not a weakling
I'm trying to fly out to see Jessica Alba in bikini's

Big Smallworld, Ludacris, Steph Ginga
Holla at us when you see us, if you want us, how I need us

Cause they mad broke and I get them hoes

Chingy,"Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I'd done been around the world thought I'd seen it all
Er color, er shape, what I need and all,
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring, & fall,
& back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet & all.
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day,
I get em alone I jump em and then fade away,
I give it good so some of them won't stay away,
They try to lock me up, but I break away.
& to the day I lay my eyes on the princess,
& yu can tell she was a dime from a distance,
It took a minute to come to my senses,
She's the perfect match and God is my witness,
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes,
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky,
Feels like I'm in heaven, & I'm hopin' to fly,
Baby girl come along for the ride, yu know why cuz I....

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I ain't neva had a girl that was so fly,
Other guys come around, you actin' so shy,
You got em shakin' in their boots, and I know why,
Cuz they can't handle the truth and that's no lie,


As for me, I'm the one that you been dreamin' on,
& wen yu saw me I'm the one that yu were steamin' on,
& when yu need it I'm the shoulder that yu would be leanin' on,
Take off that Gucci and keep them vickie secrets on,
Let's take a flight because the world is our playground,
And buy houses from the lou, to the A-Town,
It's silk sheets so it's soft when yu lay down,
Ching-a-ling yea, I get down, and stay down,
There's no one better baby girl you'sz a blessin',
You got me headin' in a positive direction,
You got my vote, when yu re-up for election,
Cuz all I wanna do is give you love and affection.

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Why yu wastin' your time, & boy, runnin' the streets,
When you can just come to me? [huh]
You know I got what you need,
I got what you want,
Boy, won't you come and see?
What if you never, [seen] a girl like me ever, [like me before]?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry,
Cuz, I'm, so, flyyyyy.

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
Theres some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& yu partied,in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me

Chingy,"[Intro:]
Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about whats going on in the hood


Uh Uh, yeah, uh yeah yeah 
This your boy chingaling man, 
Need to talk to the world real quick, 
Talk to em man, 
You know we got a lot of problems going on in the inner city, 
In the ghetto, in the hood, they ain't hearin' you, 
Ain't nobody touchin' on, 
Democrats, republicans, all those folks, 
You know they don't care 
Whats going on in the ghetto anyway


[Verse 1:]
Errday I wake up 
With a regular mentality, 
But I'm a target on the street and thats just reality, 
Cats in the ghetto ain't never had a high salary, 
Except makin' deals and selling blow in the alley, 
See the system was made for us to fail, look at the jails, 
Overpopulated with Mexicans and young black males, 
I ain't tellin' the tale, so we choose heaven or hell, 
Don't care about letters from school, 
We'd rather get street mail, 
I been a witness to some murders snitchin I do without it, 
But then I wonder why the damn police dont do nothing about it, 
Go to the unemployment office, hell yeah its crowded, 
Our hoods takin' wrong turns now its time to reroute it, 
I know a lil' dude 13, 
Carry a burner dropped out of school, 
Teacher said he wasn't a fast learner, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years I wonder where we gon' be, 
When I say we, I mean my black community, ya digg

[Chorus:]
They dont know, 
How it feels to hurt so long, 
Cause they never walked in these shoes, 
And they never had to cry these blues, 
How many men, turn their back on us so long, 
Always say what they gon do, 
But they never seem to come through

[Verse 2:]
Pardon my french but I dont think we ready for a lady president, 
Its evident that its a mans world so thats irrelevant, 
The system think we all niggas and we not intellegent, 
But martin luther and malcolm taught me before im heavensent, 
The girls havin kids and they still some kids, 
Poppin' them out one after another like thats what it is, 
Its innocent cats doin bizz, 
They just tryin to life, 
And the police dont even know if the crime they did, 
Its got my brain in a twist, so im twistin a leaf, 
On my balcony smokin and drinkin trying to see some relief, 
If I can change our neighborhoods I would, put that on me, 
This world messed up, and that Stevie Wonder can see, 
So to my dogs locked down set ya mind free, 
Cause you and I dont even believe you can get your degree, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years where we gon be, 
And when I say we I mean my black community, lets go

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I twist the cap off the bottle, 
Take a sip and see tomorrow, like pac, 
Wash away the sorrow while police hit the block, I be up all night, 
Askin' god for the truth, 
He told me thinking translated in my own words in the booth, 
Try to reach the youth, 
Cause thats what matters today, 
I'm ain't too religious but I get on my knees and pray, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years where we gon be, 
I ain't gotta wonder no more, 
My people rollin' with me, yeah

She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I don't like 
We didn't have a worry in the world, got you diamonds got you pearls 
Cut can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls 
Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it 
You got a good nigga on the side, you betta run wit it
Even though I'm on tha road doin' shows
I make time for me n her, relationship to grow 
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry 
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me 
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her 
May conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her
(Uh) I thought I was your man 
Guess you ain't understand 
N now I'm sittin' here, lookin' crazy like 
Damn! 

[Chorus] 

Walkin' to house from hard work, my head hurts
Instead of arguin', can I have dinner with some dessert (uh uh) 
She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Hey, give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned 
Before we end up fightin', let me leave 
I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need 
Now I'm wit the fellas ridin' n drinkin' 
She's blowin' my two way up but I need some time for thinkin' 
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin' naaaw 
Give her some space and the next day I might call 
What should I do 
Look, let me ask ya'll 
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall 
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed 
But it happens some time 
It's either love it or give it up 
I thought I was your man 
Guess you ain't understand 
Now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like 
Damn! 

[Chorus] 

[JD:] Chingy holla at dem again !! 

Ta all the fellas know you feel me, if you eva had a woman
Good times led to bad times n you ain't see it coming
Try the best to make her happy
But it wasn't enough
'Cause mamma told me in relationship to roll ya bluff 
I don't wanna have my head down 
Weak n stressed out 
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next round 
(Uh) I thought I was her man 
Guess she ain't understand 
N now she's sittin' hurr lookin' crazy like 
Damn!

Another motherfuckin' dollar...
But look, nigga...
It's how we do
Livin' in the ghetto, ooh, ooh

[Chorus:]
Livin' life up on the corner
Slangin' rocks and smokin' weed
From an eightball to a G
Worked my way to a ki
All I can try to do is hold on
Caught up in the struggle
Seems the only way to be
Never gone find no peace
Till the day they bury me
All I can try to do is be strong

And nigga, you can find me
Hangin' up on the corner
Or layin' up in the cut
Tryin' to get my motherfuckin' money right
My hammer right beside me
And I really don't give a fuck
If somebody gotta die tonight
'Cause look...nigga, my pocket full of stones
Is everything I own
And this is all I do, all I do
A nigga straight hustlin' everyday to get through, get through

[Chorus]

Gotta be on the lookout for them stick-up boys
'Cause when they come
They be straight hemmin' niggas up
And it really all about takin' that money, man
If they catch me, they better kill me
Ain't comin' out like no punk
Shit, can't let no nigga take nothin' from me, man
Cause look, yo...they steppin' in my zone
And infiltratin' my home
And what the fuck would you do?
If a nigga straight...took ya cake
And tried to break you, break you

I wish that I could let it go
How we in the struggle and hustlin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that we ain't have to be so canivin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
How my niggas in the pen doin' time just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that genocide wasn't survivin' just to make it out the ghetto

Everyday is just weed, rocks, and pistols, cops comin' to git you
When niggas that want to put you on shirts readin', ""We Miss You""
Everything I been through, nothin' but issues
Tired of goin' to funerals and passin' moms the tissue
Getcha prayer in ya life, it's hard to listen
When there ain't nothin' fair in ya life
It's God that's missin', that's what they be tellin' me
And I try to wait but He be takin' so long
I'll probably catch another felony, inhalin' weed
Keepin' me broke, though, I slangs my coke
I probably push less weight than the trees I smoke
And ain't no hope for tomorrow, hot, heavy wit sorrow
Cause my peers bring tears from findin' em full of hollows
I know you probably goin' through the same thing
The same pain, cause we caught up in the same game
And don't a damn thing change, nigga, bump this song

Deep in the cut
With the chrome on the thrown
Down in Decatur
Where the haters get shown

Ride around the spots 
Where the pot gets grown
Now I'm feelin blowed
Smoke by the zone

Misfit dudes by the rules reapply
Creeps low wit cruise control when I'm high
Brand new 22 shoes on the ride
Gotta get blatta tatted
Hit up green rise

So I'm ridin down this long country road
Followin rainbows
Tryna reach us in gold
I gotta grind hard
'Til this shit gets sold
Just sit back relax 
N watch it unfold
So I'm gone hit up the studio
Write about 24

Chink Santana,"Hey, she can't love you like I love you
Started really simple
Coming through 'cause I missed you, and I couldn't wait to kiss you
I tried to play shy a little, but not trying to move fast but not too slow
Because I know, you're the kind of guy, I see you already got me

She could never be no
Half as good as me, let me show
You know what I mean, cause I'm the real thing and I got to have you
Been here by your side, living for you day and night
Can't understand why you're not my man but
I should be your girl

I'm falling in love again, god damn we kissed again, it went a little bit further than
I'm falling,
I thought this boy was just a friend, I need my baby here
Cause can't nobody love me like he can

And now it's late now no talk, convos on the phone getting sparked
I'm about to jump in my car, and come and see you
No holding back I miss you, I'm letting go tonight
Oh, and baby I need you, and nothing can stop me, we're too close now

Everything you do, got me crazy over you ,
I can't stand the fact, that she is always on your back so
What's up
What you going do, 'cause I'm really feeling you, oh yeah
And boy I need to know, if you think that I should be your girl

I'm falling in love again, god damn we kissed again, it went a little bit further than
I'm falling,
I thought this boy was just a friend, I need my baby here
Cause can't nobody love me like he can

She can't love you like I love you

She can't love you like I love you

Dang shorty I got my mind on my money and the hood got me tied up
Plus my baby momma keep me fired up, these other broads probably get me wired up
But a fly nigga could see that you a rider, that's how you got me creepin' and crawlin'
Deep into a bawl six in the morning, we in the zone deep then we all in,
Trying to get it on then the bitch keep callin' (I need you) And she be killing it though,
I see you trying to fight it but you feelin' me though
Look, I'm feeling you right back, I'm gonna pick you up in the back I know you like that

I'm falling in love again, god damn we kissed again, it went a little bit further than

Know they staring brain feels like a wheel lost with out the ball bearing 
Stuck contemplating on who I can trust 
But like lleullo in a bill my feelings just get crushed 
But that's why I stick with my duns like I stick with the guns 
Don't get mad rip your hun concentrate on my funds 
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist 
Never get patted down when I step in the place 

Jiggied up, smoke the pot, confirm if it is real reefer or not 
Rally up, after this get followed straight to the crib 
Gem Star, double edge apply pressure 
Shave em down, blow marks right through your mecca 
want to be a thug, now you got the thug look, 
Stick em up, leave medicaid, with the real to push 
God body, with a rubber grip black shotti 
Pump one in his ass make that nigga switch hobbies 

A dossage, hand delivered, without postage 
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice 
Niggas get sniped like, Klonker Brockite 
Show em how to rock right, when bitches hold the mic, street life 

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues 
This is real, this is ill street news 
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck 
Now his brother ain't giving a fuck 
Little sister giving up the butt now, Dun don't wet that 
I want you to rest black, cause you better belive Noyd gon handle that 
'Cause when I get em, I'm gonna have em 
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at them 

I ain't no killer, you know me 
But I'll be damned if I don't lie for my C-O-D 
And then this Old G, scold me and told me coldly 
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey 
But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means 
I never been clean 
Nigga, my whole click got dirty 
From the battles, to the trials and bloody up shirtsleeves 
Nigga you heard me, its gangsta 

Vision the canvas I paint a picture 
Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga 
But mines is more ghetto more guns more drugs, mostly thugs 
All my duns, their baby moms daughter and sons 
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out 
Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out 
Jumped off the roof to his death its real 
Hand Ball walls displayed with are I-P murials 
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building 
Devils spring, keep em going while the snows blowing 

Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke 
And spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke 
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects 
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at 
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off 
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off

What the fuck time is it!?!
It's like 3 o'clock, man, thought you was coming to get me, man!?!

Please, man, come get me man, before I choke this bitch, man!
Hurry up son, man it's like 90 man, let's get some hoes or something.

What up, dun!?!
Same ol' shit.
No doubt, ain't nothing new... .
Let's take a little spin, dun, word up.

Yo... open my wings to a new day spread my lungs
Get laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns
Twist the key, shifted to D then flee
Before anything, get the daily dose of choke
We got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float
My eye's burnin' from the dope killin' my throat
Lean my seat a taste, lumbar support
On the belt doin' 90 or more
debatin' on the latest rhyme wars
Where units don't count
But your rap pay add up to large amounts
Get my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep
Catch chills off'a infamous beats
Swing the trees doin' one-handed you'ees
Blowin' on the ouwee ?cause we can't have the medicine canoein'
There go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that
Ay yo dun, hold that down and turn it around
Dirty as fuck, thugs drugs and guns, d's and fatigues
T n T hopin' out of MPV's
Surprise all'a fuck out of me
Got rubber Glocks pointed at me
Ay yo twin, what the fuck... ..

They had us laid out on the ground holdin' us down
With gats to back of our heads was goin' down
?It wasn't us that held up that bitch you got.
Where's the proof, man!? Let me speak to my attorney.?
I know the routine, don't try to throw me
I been gettin' knocked since 12 and my moms tried to scold me
... but all that told me to get in more shit
ay yo P', (what up) you my co-d, we both get knocked
What you did with that half'a tree? (right in my sock.)
Yo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot
Dun, you know how I get down!?!
Yo I'm ready to bounce
Do the 100 yard-dash and tear ass
If my other half was alive we woulda got killt
?'cause dun woulda went for the guns and got ill
Plus I gots cracks on me, they foundt the cracks on me
Looked at'em, gave'em back to me
I could swore they was takin' us in
Then the lady in the car said, ?..that's not them.?
Picked us up, told me I could keep the drugs
They didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns
An' you ain't gotta tell us twice
We hopped in the car and slid off
On our way up-town for more of that funk
P' lit the tree back up
Got off the Tri-burrough, hit the Henry Huds'
?Fuckit, let's slide through the Rutgers.?
Roll the windows down 'cause infamous mobb bumpers...

... Skip To My Lou had the crowd jumpin'
Took a walk through the park frontin'
Didn't even have to hurt nuttin'
Man I love it, ain't nothin' like summer in New York
Hear Infamous Thoughts, then the Dream Team music starts
Damn, we young black entrepreneurs
New York Pricks and Dicks can't stop our floss

Dead serious cash, luxurious labs

There is nothing I can do
To stop it

The color of you eyes, the scent of your hair
I know dreams aren't reality
But you're so real
So real to me

I couldn't see that you were always there for me

Of with tears my pillow's wet

In a river of my homelessness

How I feel inside

Low down decaying joy no hope to keep me whole
No breeze to comfort me no love to save my mood
Sunlight burns into me I'm branded solitude

How many times can I ignore
That devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die but still I live

Too many thoughts demanding what I'm meant to do
Too many pains of old call out the pains of new
I squeeze my head so hard to force the demons out
Dark angels laugh at me and all that I'm about


How many times can I ignore
That devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die but still I live

Chino & Nacho,"Si tú te vas 
Se muere el amor 
El que tú me das 
Y llega el dolor 
Seré un vagabundo 
Solo en este mundo sin rumbo 

Me delata la mirada 
Hacerme el tonto ¿para qué? 
Si a mí no me importa nada 
Prefiero vivir y perder 
Que no haber vivido nada 
Si te vas 
Quedare en un dolor 
Que jamás conocí 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(No sé cómo explicarte) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(En mi mundo y que cada segundo) 
Me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé 

(Señorita el doblete) 

Suave, suave 
Como usted sabe 
Sacúdelo, muévelo 
Que nunca se acabe 
Duro, la reina de la clave 
Te lo juro, que lo que siento en el pecho no me cabe 
Te imagino diciendo que me ilumino 
Si no te tuviera, te digo que me arruino 
Culpa del destino que te puso en mi camino 
Que nadie se meta con este amor clandestino 

Andas en mi cabeza 
Bella princesa 
Olvida los problemas y las tristezas 
Me ves y el corazón me lo atraviesas 
Belleza date un trago y ponte traviesa 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(No se cómo explicarte) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Porque tú eres mi mundo y que cada segundo) 
Me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé 

Imagínate que tú conoces lo que desconoces 
Yo me convierto en lobo después de las doce 
Si no tuviera a mi loba pa’ que la despose 
Me voy con la manada hasta que me destroce 
Porque en la calle hay mucha compe 
Siempre lo bueno se corrompe 

Pero no quiero otra mujer aprovechándose 
Cuando tú eres la que me encanta chica 
Nunca yo me atreveré a dejarte sola 
Chiqui, chiqui, chiqui, chica nunca sola 
Por ti yo guardé mi pistola 
Las gaticas no me controlan 
Capturando yo lo sé 
Pero me quiere a la vez 
Solo pide que te de 
My love que te, my love que te  

A través de mi carta quiero confesarte 
que han sido enteras las noches sin poder besarte 
notaras que lleva mi perfume y no encuentro estampa
que sigo olvidadizo y que caigo en mi propia trampa 

quizás te pasa igual y sientes que no es normal 
que no duermes en la noche y entiendes que no es real 
con la distancia llama los recuerdos de la cama 
tu eres reina de mi cabeza, yo el rey que tu amas (Don) 

Donde vas, regresa pronto, vuelve a mi
sin ti ya no puedo pensar ya no puedo dormir 
no me acostumbro a vivir lejos de ti 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(D, d, DY, Gaby Music) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Chino & nacho baby) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (jumbo)
Contigo me case (el que produce solo) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas)

Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé",Andas En Mi Cabeza [Remix],
Chino & Nacho,"Hoy desperté, amándote 
Me la pase, pensándote 
Y me acosté, extrañándote 
Todo mi día fue para ti 
Te imagine abrasándome 
Y me encontré, besándote 
Amanecer soñandote, es un gran placer para mi 
Nadie ha podido ni podrá, tomar tu lugar 

Eres mi chica ideal, a quien quiero querer 
No pareces real, preciosa mujer 
Mi chica ideal de mi jardín el clavel 
Yo te quiero amar, hasta envejecer 
Yo te quiero amar, hasta envejecer 
De ti me siento enamorado, siento enamorado 
De ti me siento enamorado, siento enamorado 
De ti me siento enamorado, enamorado de ti, de ti de ti! 

Eres la margarita que a diario me embriaga
Son tus besos, tus caricias 
Tu sonrisa tu ardiente mirada 
El saber que hay comodidad cuando la intimidad 
Mis manos se deslizan suavemente en tu piel erizada 
De que no se enteraría la gente si ese cuerpo hablara 
Si en el momento de hacer el amor no nos importa nada 
Se me salió a mí lo de demente y a ti lo de malvada 
Y luego reposamos con los rostros en la misma almudada 
Yo enamorado si tu enamora 
Yo ilusionado si tu ilusionada 
En ti yo conseguí lo que me faltaba 
Pero igual tú encontraste en mí lo que tanto buscaba 
Tú y yo no discutimos nunca no para nada 
Tú y yo nos conocimos esa linda madrugada 
Desde allí tú me zumbaste una flechada 
Bajo un cielo convido de estrellas y la luna asomada 
Viniste y me dijiste a nadie le creías nada 
Prefieres estar libre que con alguien y amarrada 
Luego a mí me conociste y con la primera mirada 
Tus sabias que me amarías y ahora me amas más que nada 
Yo enamorado si, tu enamorada 
Yo ilusionado si tu ilusionada 
En ti yo conseguí lo que me faltaba 

Eres mi chica ideal, a quien quiero querer 
No pareces real, preciosa mujer 
Mi chica ideal de mi jardín el clavel 
Yo te quiero amar, hasta envejecer 
Yo te quiero amar, hasta envejecer 

De ti me siento enamorado, siento enamorado 
De ti me siento enamorado, siento enamorado 
De ti me siento enamorado, enamorado de ti, de ti de ti! 

De ti me siento enamorado, siento enamorado 
De ti me siento enamorado, siento enamorado 
De ti me siento enamorado, enamorado de ti",Chica Ideal,

Hemos decidido vivir la rutina 
De seguir durmiendo 
En la misma cama 
Pero la verdad es que tenemos miedo 
Y sin darnos cuenta estamos compitiendo 
Para ver quien dice 
La ultima palabra 

Y no queremos ser sinceros,
Y aceptar que ya no queda nada 
Que ya no existe la ilusión de despertar 
Juntos cada mañana 
Y que los días se nos van 
En no mirarnos a la cara 
Para poder disimular 
Como si nada nos pasara 
Pero no es verdad!

Que se apago la llama!
El fuego que quemaba 
Ya se acabo la magia que nos envolvía 
Nuestro amor se termino 
Así como si nada

Es ternura y pasión
Tú me has hecho sentir
Que hay en mi corazón
Tanto amor

Yo nací para ti
Y tú también para mí
Y ahora sé que morir es tratar de vivir
Sin tu amor
Sin tu amor

Mi niña bonita mi dulce princesa
Me siento en las nubes cuando tú me besas
Y siento que vuelo más alto que el cielo
Si tengo de cerca el olor de tú pelo

Mi niña bonita brillante lucero
Te queda pequeña la frase te quiero
Por eso mis labios te dicen te amo
Cuando estamos juntos más nos enamoramos

Aquí hay amor
Aquí hay amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay hay hay hay hay hay amor

Este amor que como espuma sube
Que cuando te tomo de la mano por el parque
Camino en las nubes
Parece mentira que ya no recuerdo nada
Cuando solo estuve
Nada se podrá comparar
Con algo tan especial

Nada se compara con lo nuestro mi vida

Le agradezco al tiempo
Que me ha demostrado que las cosas buenas llegan
En cualquier momento
Yo no imaginaba que conocería
Algún día este sentimiento
Un amor puro y natural
Digno de admirar
(digno de admirar princesa)

Un amor de fantasía, lleno de romance y alegría
De bello detalle cada día
Nena quién lo diría
Que algún día yo me enamoraría
Y que sin tu amor no viviría
Como sabia que esto pasaría
Que ibas a ser mía
Y que yo querría
Amarte por siempre mi niña bonita

Mi niña bonita mi dulce princesa
Me siento en las nubes cuando tú me besas
Y siento que vuelo más alto que el cielo
Si tengo de cerca el olor de tú pelo

Para que bebas tiernamente a estar conmigo

Y regalarte un mundo lleno de ilusiones
Lleno de magia, canciones y melodías
Todo eso y mucho mas yo te daría
Si solamente tu me dieras la oportunidad

En un crucero conociendo el verdadero amor
Si solamente tu me dieras la oportunidad
De escabullirme por tu vida y poder entrar
Hasta atrapar la mayoría de tus sentimientos 
Con esta trampa de pasiones que ahora llevo dentro
Solamente estoy pidiendo una oportunidad

Que otro motivo necesitas, para darte cuenta
Que te amo demasiado entonces! porque no lo intentas?
No pienses tanto que la mente no tiene razón
Cuando el problema tiene que ver con el corazon
Solo imagino mi futuro estando a tu lado
Pues locamente de ti estoy enamorado
Te juro que lo que yo siento es una realidad
Que para amarte se hace corta hasta una eternidad

Hago rimas en mi vieja libreta
Miro al cielo esperando un cometa
Para pedirle un deseo y es que te traiga hasta aquí

Un armario de páginas completas
Que escribo cuando te veo y eso me hace feliz, muy feliz
Feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz
Muy feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz

Me hace feliz tenerte
Y es que me imagino al lado tuyo hasta la muerte
Siempre que me asomo a mi venta es para verte
Quiero que la siguiente mañana traiga suerte
Para convertirme en el dueño de tu corazón
Parar ser realidad lo que paso como ilusión
Una sensación, la falta de  razón
La combinación de amor con atracción
Tu me gustas, como negarlo
No me asusta, solo hay que demostrarlo
Estoy buscando una oportunidad para expresarlo
Por lo que veo yo voy a amarte por un rato largo

Bien loco y hasta me mandaste al manicomio
Si es que estar contigo es pecar que me lleve el demonio
Y es que por ti yo me lanzo a la candela
Y pecaría como lo hizo Adán con todo y su Eva
Y es que yo quiero comerme la manzana de tu boca
Todo lo que quiero es tu dulce con sabor a fruta fresca
Es que cuando bailas tu a mi me provocas
Y me provoca abusar de tu belleza

Chino & Nacho,"Pobre corazón decepcionado
Te quedaste acostumbrado
A otra forma de querer

Pobre por que nadie te ha
Enseñado Que en la vida
Ganas más cuando
Se aprende a perder

Y es que nadie
Nació  con instructivo
Para amar

Nadie aprende a ser feliz
Y no llorar

Tú que te escudaste tras un muro
Y te has sentido tan seguro
Ocultándote detrás

No te has dado cuenta de tu error
Se necesita del amor como
Del aire al respirar

Y es que nadie aprende
A ser feliz y no llorar

Nadie Nació  con instructivo
Para amar

Date cuenta corazón
Que es el amor, quien cura
Las heridas y el dolor

Que aunque pueda hacer sufrir
O hacer llorar
Regresara a volverte a levantar

Date cuenta corazón
Que es por amor que
Existe cada sueño en tu interior

Ahí que encontrar",Pobre Corazón,2011

Apenas nos vimos
Sé que nos sentimos brutal
Y a mí me tiene mal

Y tu sonreías
Seguro sabías
Lo que a los dos nos iba a pasar
(Yo sé que tu también sientes lo mismo)

Esta es mi forma de decirte hoy
Que donde tú me digas voy

Hay un lugar tan especial (tan especial)
En donde yo contigo quisiera estar
Ese lugar tan especial
Donde si quieres nos besamos

Yo no sé si es el escote en tu espalda
O si será lo corta e' tu falda
Esas curvas tienen un hook que a mí me atrapa

Sobre tus alas yo despego mi vuelo
Bailar contigo pegaito yo quiero
Tú me llevas en tus brazos hasta el cielo

Ese lugar, tan especial
Donde yo contigo quisiera estar

Ese lugar, tan especial
Donde si quieres nos besamos

Tú tiene' un swing
Y un movimiento demasiado animal
Tú me provocas un sentimiento de carácter sensual
Tú eres una señorita original (wow)

La manera de explicarte 
Cuanto te quiero 
Y parece que no existen palabras 
Para la magnitud de este sentimiento 

Eres la luz que me ilumina la vida 
Mi sol, mi esperanza, tu mi melancolía 
Eres mi pena y también mi mas linda poesía 

Mi fantasía, inspiración en mi canto 
Eres mi alegría tu secaste mi llanto 
El sol de mis días y del cielo siento que eres el manto 

Como un milagro que nunca espere 
Con la magia de un beso has cambiado mi ser 
Hoy nuevamente en el amor yo vuelvo a creer 
Hoy vuelvo a creer 

Te quiero, simplemente te quiero 
Te quiero, tan solo para mi 
Te quiero, simplemente te quiero 
Te quiero, yo nací para ti 

No existe amor que se compare en el mundo 
Al amor con que contraigas en un beso profundo 
Quiero solo amarte hasta que mueras sin perder un segundo 

Como un milagro que nunca espere 
Con la magia de un beso has cambiado mi ser 
Hoy nuevamente en el amor yo vuelvo a creer 
Hoy vuelvo a creer 

Te quiero, simplemente te quiero 
Te quiero, tan solo para mi 
Te quiero, simplemente te quiero 
Te quiero, yo nací para ti 

Hay un eclipse de luna en tu pelo 
Eclipse de luna en tu pelo 
Tengo un barco velero que navega en mi vida 
Y a tu lado no temo a tempestad ni irme a la deriva 

Te quiero como el mar a la arena 
Como la brisa a la noche serena 
Como jardinero en medio de la faena 
Se pega en el aroma que desprende una azucena 
Hasta que vaya sin pena 
Te quiero como quiere un caribeño a su morena 
Como un bailador al ritmo de la macarena 
Como a mi me gusta la bomba y la plena 

Te quiero, simplemente te quiero 
Como quiere el día al azul del cielo 
Te quiero, tan solo para mi 
Así como a las noches, a la luna te quiero 
Te quiero, simplemente te quiero 
Como la tierra seca, tu eres el aguacero

Se me lengua la traba cada vez que me miras 
No se como esquivar esa mirada asesina 
Me da un no se que en todo el cuerpo

Ay ni yo mismo lo creo 
Que recarga mi batería cuando te veo 
Y regreso a los tiempos de julieta y romeo 
Ay se me olvida hasta el alfabeto

Electrizas toda mi anatomía 
Una bomba atómica de energía 
Que explota en mi cuerpo
Por fuera y por dentro, perdido me encuentro 
De ti enamorado sin querer queriendo

Que te te te que que quiero amor te quiero 
Y tartamudeo amor cuando te veo 
No no no no se lo que me esta pasando 
Solo se que para ti yo estoy guardando mi amor

Este amor, este amor 
Mi amor
Este amor, este amor 
Es como una epidemia

Me pongo medio lo lo lo, tartamudeo 
En en en mi corazón tu hiciste un saqueo 
Me robaste to to to to todos mis deseos

Ay cuando te veo, me tiembla la vida 
Contigo voy de bajada y subida 
Creo que hasta dios se canso que le pida 
Que un pedacito de amor me consiga, ay ve

Por fuera y por dentro 
Perdido me encuentro

Indaga la policía 
De amor y otras fantasías 

Fracasa la detective

Que triste que a la locura 
A veces le encuentre cura 

Ay amor, se acabó

No sé quién tiene la culpa 
Ni quién nos dio aquella idea 
Amar a dos no resulta 
Por muy sabroso que sea 

No sé quién tiene la culpa

Hay que seguir otra ruta 
Antes que suba la marea

Shes all up in my head now, 
Got me thinking that it might good idea to take her with me, 
Cause she's ready to leave. 
Now I gotta keep it real now, 
Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty, 
And that just ain't me. 

Cause I do know if I take that chance just where is it gonna lead, 
But what I do know is the way she dance makes shawty alright with me. 
The way she getting low! 
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me. 
She asked for one more dance and I'm

There's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime,
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmastime

But say a prayer,
Pray for the other ones
At Christmastime it's hard,
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window,
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow

You're everything
That's why I cling to you
When I emerge
My thoughts converge to you
To you

The world is so small
Compared to you
And everybody's wrong
Compared to you
To you

I begin to see through your eyes
All the former mysteries are no surprise
So now, you listen
'cause I'm omniscient

Hey look at me lady
I'm just a little baby
You're lucky to have me
I'm cute and sweet as candy

As charming as a fable
I'm innocent and disabled
So hug me and kiss me
Then wipe my butt and piss me

I hope you never leave
'cause who would hear me scream?
Nobody understands
Except the toys in my hands

So now you listen
'cause I'm omniscient

Hey look at me lady
I'm just a little baby
If I smile, then you smile
Then I'll get mad for awhile

I melt in your mouth
And in your hands whenever I can
But I really do nothing
Except kickin' and fussin'

I like to make a mess
I laugh at your distress
I sit all day in my crib
Absorbing all you give

I'm helpless
I'm flawless
I'm a machine

Give me
I need my toys

Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me everlong

So now you listen
'cause I'm omniscient

Chino Moreno,"So you think you can step to me and still breath in
life
You've bit off more than you can chew
I am the beast and your god is not here today
There is no need for praying

Bow..
Dont fucking look at me your sight alone impales me
Bow..
I feel the rage in me I have to let it go

There is only pain to thrive on

The smell of blood is the only thing that will satisfy
Your dying body twitching trying to grasp for life

So long i've taken your shit
But now you've crossed the line
The price to pay is mine to claim
Now blood lust is mine

Divulge..

There's only dying to give
No use trying to live
Give in accept and embrace your fate
There's no stopping me
Carnage is all I need
Inhale your final breath

Your limbs slowly release
The floor greets your defeat
With your last breath
Now you beg for mercy

Too late vengeance is mine...",Vengeance Is Mine,2007
Chino Moreno,"Gather the bones and lay them in the sun in patterns that capture the eye
No one could know, display for everyone the holes in our souls we despise
Timber and stone, monumental, remnants frozen in time
Carried alone the burden, knowing it was all we could do to survive

Only embers remain
Refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
Black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain

Scatter the dust, what we once held in hand seems was never at all
Gone in a gust, not ours to understand, ah, agony perpetual
Holding my breath and close my eyes, for a second I can see you again
Motionless, like that day we lost who we both should have been

Only embers remain
Refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
Black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers

I've been staring at her
Lying still for so long (she's so still, she's so still)
Waiting for this endless
Night to color into dawn (it's neverending, it's neverending)
But it's never lifting, it's always shifting
No one can breathe
It holds me under, and this drags down you
(It drags you down, it drags you down)
This breaks what was made one into two",Embers,2015
Chino Moreno,"Lift off like Virgin Galactic
My Richard's too Branson, to fuck with you bastard
Very legendary, that's a matter of fact
Shit, you're the opposite of star
Like rats spelled backwards
I flow poems out to Saturn and passed it
Easy as a standard anti-gravity back flip
Satellite tracking can't map up my tactics
I spit the same shit they split an atom in half with
No, it's not what I want but it had to be
I spent 6 months just recharging my battery
Imagine me quitting, what a travesty that'd be
Your space shuttle challenges are nothing but tragedies
So take care on the path that you're headed
I'm the father to your style, don’t you ever forget it
I don't drop mics, only let it smoke or I said it
And I don't play even when they press it, get it?

I'm off of the earth, I'll ride alone
I'm drifting away, out of time, I flow
Away from the truth, 
away from the night
Away from the day
I'm off of the earth, I'll ride alone

Please brace for impact
I must have went to space and got sent back
But I'm still intact, in fact, take a picture of me
You can see that I'm a star with your lens cracked
Supernova, it's Caesar's palace stuntin' on my apartments
'Cause history'll show, we done been to war like Romans
Did that dance with the devil, hail high as a kettle
So it's no wonder why I put this ice on all of my metal
We'll wear that shit like a medal, used to think I was a joker
No Jared Leto when I said I'd get us out the ghetto
Slam my foot on the pedal, put the studio
And I couldn't afford instrumentals
Fuck it, record a cappella
Flying coach streaming Coachella until they ban me
Now they like Bambi's mother's, dead, I'm onto these Grammy's
I'm rolling these grams gladly, purple and green like dabbie
Shades on like Velma, hair long like Shaggy
Crushin' addies in my water,  got my voice raspy
Haven't slept since California and that shit was last week
Paranoid when I sleep but when I'm high I'm happy
That's what I need to kiss the sky when I get stuck in the valley

Soft motherfuckers
With the bitches that don't give a fuck!

Now who want to diss to get they reps a little _bigger_
How many bitches want to fuck this _yellow nigga_
You get your whole crew cut like a scissor
Watch this world shake from the album I deliver

[Verse One]
I threw a Brownstone at Brandy now she's Changing Faces
Standing in my Aaron Hall I'm Blackstreet packin suitcases
Goin back to Indiana, on the Subway
Soul For Real, missjones is my usher in church on Sundays
Clear the runways, cause I'ma make you rappers my examples
Avoiding battling me like I'm Eazy-E's blood samples
It's me and Carey, nah never wrote no rhyme that's ordinary
Won't throw my life away on coke like Darryl Strawberry
Removing you skeletal system playing your ribs like xylophones
I'm nastier, leave you scraped and ashier than Larry Holmes
But ladies I ain't always violent
You could pump pump until the dawn, like Adina Howard
Can't You See, I'm Notorious as Total get
Uptown Girls in bed, like Billy Joel do
Laverne and Shirle, give us any room we'll break it
Remember you was wack remember Ice Cube had a jheri curl
BAMMMMM!!!! Dead on your car horn chump
My beat get messy as abortion on the ninth month
Now who be that, slap, did iiii do that?
Now Whoopi Goldberg goes Steve Urkel
but I'll leave your grill The Color Purple
Give you a Dogg Pound, could even Dru Down
Provoke me album is weak your whole shit sound like karaoke
Conversation, loss of limbs amputation
Head meaning decapitation rough like Craig Mack derm abrasion
Evil tendency, strong like Miles Davis heroin dependency
Fuckin up lives like teenage pregnancy

[Verse Two]
Them clowns like Will Smith got fast cars and fancy homes
But I'm headstrong, I could even break Puffy Combs
Some kids still doubtin and they girlfriend stalkin keep it real
We'll cross that bridge when we come to that Anita Hill
Now Ever_last_, will never _last_, with no ghetto _pass_
Leave you breathin hard like bitches at lamaze _class_
Niggaz are slippin when they sippin gin and tonic
smokin chronic Jersey niggaz packin more handguns than Harry Connick
My style is welfare, half of you bitches is on it!!
Was born with a halo, when broke, I had to pawn it
I stir up controversy and sell I'm like Sister Souljah
So bring out bum-ass Russell Simmons 'cause comedy's over
The Lucci I'm worth is enough to deficit a nation
With media coverage like a hostage situation
(yeah and if you lovin them hoes you betta bounce back)
Tryin to make that bitch your wife she fucked
the whole New Jersey Drive (soundtrack)
High like Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jams on tour
Rrrraahahrra rrrarhraarah I rips it like a chainsaw
Dig deep as truth go ahead and shoot your Karl Kani suit
in shock absorbing tired and I'm wide like a police informant
Pray with one eye open, shootin more Led than Zeppelin
Dysfunctional like the Jackson's, death is my obsession
You comin through with thirty cowards think you causin fear
Rush lookin bust in your boosted Donna Karan gear
Now fuck the po-po, beats down the five-oh
Been there, done that, do it again tomorrow nigga
Sometimes I vibe inside a spot where nobody else knows me
Until I come hot steppin like Ini Kamoze

You know, taking these metaphors and just butchering
icons in the urban community.  I don't know, it's
like you sucking em dry, what are you some kind of a vampire
or something?  Yeah yeah that's what you are, what ahh what
a ghetto vampire, that's it.
So where'd all this come from?  Think back
Try to remember think back try to remember

I used to sit at the right hand of God in light and splendor
Lavishly spreading love that's all I remember
As time passes I catches miracles he taught me
Everything except for some old man and breathe the breath of life
I tried, to just accept he's my savior
But jealousy forced me into sacrilegious behavior
Enraged like I was no threat I hated God's laughter
Waiting for the day the apprentice becomes the master
I'm cursed and damned now to be a creature of the night
Unliving yet living off blood, fearer of the light
But I don't give a fuck right, because I live forever
I see you all come and go and die and burn
And watch the world still turn
Evil entity, time is resenting me
Thousands of years later I must conceal my identity
A vampire 

Arrraahhaaa-hahahahahaha!!!

New heights, where it's so dark you need candlelights
To expose the black plague my left hand writes
Nights enveloping and developing pictures in your brain
Like a darkroom, in every monastery where I spark boom
A cartoon style smile smirk, how's my emotionless killer clown
Synapse behaps relax the bastard black balloon
Nocturnal, high off the herbal, crowding back streets and projects
Illest nigga, coolest slang dialects (dialects)
Bite marks are what you feel if you're my victim
Poisons golden seal couldn't heal from your system (from your system)
Nuts bust down the throats of mad crack heads
Fetal four-eye pleas, fuck it cops kill black kids
Sometimes I wish I could stop the death the pain and the sin
But I'm fucked up create the libations that humans contain within (nasty)
After lightning strikes the steeple of your family church
I beg forgiveness from God, but it never works
I know my soul ain't going to heaven when I expire
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire
I slit your throat and watch you shake if I desire
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire
Bear witness to the sins of wicked messiah
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire
Who can I speak to God is dead and the whole earth's on fire
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire

Running from the sun by day it's become quite obvious
To the people surrounding me I'm the wildest
Untamable blood-luster plus the high school yearbook photos
That I took in eighty-nine, show no sign of a face of mine
Intertwined my mind is a jungle full of cobwebs and tangled vines
And a glass mace even my closest friends are becoming afraid
Of how I, predicting what's happening and events
Prom dates found they're punctured, blood left pleading then lynched
That's just how I fucking express myself
When I consume your blood and leave you dead
Sorry it's just to keep my health
Dark forces, police get nauseous from my trail of corpses
No stake through my heart, no holy water, and no priest with crosses
A woman's mind gets clouded by my handsome mannerisms
Listen obsessions bigger than Jackie Gleason's aneurysms
You caught up when my piercing eyes stare right through you
Stronger than the straightest greatest ancient Haitian voodoo
My unholy presence disturbs animals and children
Built a sacrificial altar behind an abandoned building
My sense of smell is heightened my sight is razor sharp

And then the blood starts, flowing
Now I got your soul without you even knowing
Lying in a staircase covered in piss, body decomposing
I turn on sirens and I perpetuate gang violence
I'm the devil that got Malcolm X sleeping in silence
Factual I poison anything that's natural
I kill love and I'm hope frozen up just like it's a statue
Vampires walk among us sucking life from our city
Keeping us in constant states of insecurity
The police watch em they know me ghetto vampire
The government check em they know me ghetto vampire
Churches and ministries they know me ghetto vampire
Niggaz slangin' that shit they know me ghetto vampire
Money hungry bitches they know me ghetto vampire
The whole school system fucking ghetto vampires
The fucking media they know me ghetto vampires

Chino XL,"Intro:
Yeah, crazy ups and downs you know what I'm sayin'? Crazy how the world
runs, word up. Check it out. Bring it on.

Hook:
Lord I try to keep positive, but this life is full of strife
And I'm tired of trying to conquer it
Lord always thinking negative what will go wrong will go wrong
Until the beast in me vanishes

Verse 1:
First of all I was born under a bad sign, confinded to torcher
Never saw what life had to offer
Time slips away like pop singles on the radio
Chino never had the doe, I was determined though
Sabotaged at birth, cursed by an evil angel to strangle
My aspirations from every angle
From a street corner to a demo deal from Warner
Hardcore performer, crowd warmer, thought it was on but it wasn't
I never got no budget, stuck like a glue trap
It goes to prove that
Being the greatest lyricist can't paint the full picture
It's a full mixture, I can't get no, no satisfaction
Like being blind watching a movie with no closed caption
I need some time to ease my mind, I'm bested
Fuck Mr. Wendal my Development is Arrested
All I wanted to do was rock with my fast ass
And blast past the mass, collect quick cash
Did what I did best create, but began to hate
All these flake music people makin' artists wait
But I'm a be up there one day
And soon to slam wax innovate rhymes that my fans consume
I view this world through my notepad
Thus expanding my vocab to win, till then, it's all bad

Hook (x2)

Verse 2:
When I was merely a sophomore, went to Atlanta on a false tour
This ain't what I prayed so hard for
Dreams broken into individual particles like porcelain 
Figurings attached to me like barnacles
Now I'm suppose to be happy like Bobby McFerrin
Keep faith, the only thing holy is the drawers I'm wearin'
89' I aimed to graduate, no exaggerate
Evaporating positive energy from inside of me
To the point where my love for God no more provides for me
Of course lost pride, obviously the force rides 
To paradise nobody invites but puts the Bill Of Rights
1430 SAT proving ya, I'm a spick that'll die respective like Rahoul Julia
So cease with, all that street shit 
Expect MC from Chi kid, you gets the wicked priest shit
Until I see fit, to open my life strife like the pearly gates of heaven
For ? entertainment this is my expression
Prepare wealth and I'll share self, maybe I can help
But I'm lost but I be large anywhere else
The ill eagle, twisted, war novelist
The problem swallowed us, it takes an activated mind to follow this
And true to realm to be ourselves, not to follow a fad or give in to trends
Till then, it's all bad

Hook (x2)

Verse 3:
Unanswereed prayers plays the background, I pull my baseball caps down
I hide the tracks of my tears from rapping peers
I finally got on and soon he wasn't a moment to
I lose my mind, I lose my friends, my daughter and a coma too
I'm going through a strange tug of war inside my mental wall
Record just went platinum, I'm slapping 'em, I'll show you all
Cover of Rolling Stones, Vibe even TV Guide
Was filming my first movie in L.A. when I heard my baby died
Shook it off without a thought that she was beautiful
Soul Train Awards I go to not my daughters funeral
I stay drunk and high like I'm imperial
Surrounded by more white groupies than a Rakim video
Now life's a tour to me, except the way I was rejected formally
Disrespected neighborhoods I know supported me
It's eating me, suicide attemps repeatedly
What I worked so hard for, ultimately is defeating me
I'm paranoid my own mom can't avoid being a tabloid
So she wasn't shocked when my baby flopped 
Caught in the industry, spending money feverishly
Now I'mve been robbed, I can't believe my laywers did this to me
Next album was filled up with tragedy and despair
Fans with smiling faces with no real purpose for being here
I call the dear Lord when in Billboard
I plummet from 3 to 10 I guess failure is my new trend
Thought I was all that, now I just fall flat, splat
Vails of crack, my old friends won't let me call back
So where in mind can I find myself a misty storm invisible to God
I'm falling off like TJ Swan

Hook (x2)",It's All Bad,1996

What the hell made you think the sun rose and set in your ass?
Fast I remove you from my itinerary
I tense you worry and exaggerate
becoming jealous at the drop of a dime, wanting to kill all womankind
You are a perfect ten with the perfect tan goddess
Who could sell Evian to a drowning man, honest
Trying to stay sane walking that tight rope
I'm throwing you off the deep end you better pray shit floats
You gave me chills to your mind when Beverly Hills
make cleverly deals, and now you think you Brooke Shields
Hated my foes, now you one of they one a day hoes
Used to search my ass straight for weed I smoked some days before
I'm crazy yo forever goin farther than just screwin em
Making me feel like Joseph and Mary's hoein in Jerusalem
Abusin em is how they want to be treated they nosy too
Should I just slap em like Scherazade told me to
You just a tease and you play like I'm not in your league
Capturing my mind claiming I'm your biggest fantasy
I'm unattachin, what think you can spies me
If I couldn't hear your words and only judge you by your actions
Your love is sorcery, drowning in emotion poisoning me
unfortunately your memory is haunting me
I'm feeling pains, that I can't even describe
But if I have to bitch you fuckin buried me alive
Your love counterattacks, unrealistic terroristic acts
Like the Oklahoma Federal Building I collapse
I want her back, but I know that I can't force her
Thinkin bout takin my own life like Marlon Brando's daughter

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special

I'm back in town, stoppin it, makin prerogative home
She too far gone, provactive as Sharon Stone
I'm feeling crucified by the very nails I
Made and drove into myself, passed to the next guy
Phones ringin in the middle of the night (Who's that?  Nobody?)
Your whole game is getting mad sloppy
Meanwhile in my hotel lobby my hobby is removing groupies off my body
It's getting cloudy, smoggy, visibility low, foggy
Four and a half years, I screwed up once
But this ain't your first time, don't be a dummy
You got champagne tastes with fuckin beer money
Fearing bummy we had ups and downs but managed
Now the going gets rough, look how you vanished
It proves that life is a comedian like Martin Short
You standin next to me I want to file a missing child report
To find the girl we'd always planned we'd run away together
Pray together had a child swore we'd stay together
You had your chance shoulda been nice
your game is deader than Vincent Price
Giving up your ass like you Heidi Floess
Fuck your pink cop crossing guard obsession
You're half-dresses looking like a Soul Train scrambable contestant (bitch)
In my arena, should I fight or just leave her
Catch amenesia it's enough to make me catch a seizure
Catch a breather, Chino do you even need her
Should I take the three-eighty assassinate her like Selena?

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

Yesterday I seen someone who looked just like you
She walked like you do, so I thought it was you
But then she turned around confusing me
Babyface couldn't bring no cool in me
No Love Connection channel five no Chuck Woolery
Us growing old together is what I envision
You dealing with him, but let's not make no haste decision
The mechanism is getting rusty, you won't trust me
You claim when I blow up I'll leave you for some mono toiling busty
I can't believe you placed this cock above me wrong
I know you like a book but I just cannot find what page you're on
Now you put you in the middle, your voice is just a riddle
Say you want me back then change your personality like Cybill
How hard I try, I just cry more
With no reason to live, many to die for
Now as I sit in a smoky bar the night about to end
I'm passing time with strangers but this bottle is my only friend
Across the room I see a couple with no cares at all
Hugged up kissing reminding me of us before our fall
High so full of hope and passion looking at her man
The way you used to look at me when I just held your hand
You gave me vast pain, to live in the fast lane
I caught the last plane, to give you my last name
I'm caught up, my family come first, that's how I'm brought up
This tragedy's worse, than one I coulda thought up
The couple stood up, I'm feeling drugged like I took Mescaline
The couple I've been watching all the time it was her and him...

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
I wish I was special, you're so very special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep...

Chino XL,"I take your mind and I smash it into plasma
Breathe like asthma, til your just a cadaver
How fast this is, your faggot crew's a bunch of actresses
My skills go back to flippin on pissy matresses
Not Subroc, I catch you out like Matlock
Now your name's in the Way Outdated Section next to Chubb Rock
It's kind of funny, some of you cracker DJ's shun me
cause I make your favorite rappers come up short like Bud Bundy
I'm All in the Family, sick like Archie Bunker, fuckin eat it
Your styles are cheesy like a uncircumcised penis
Better jet out, brother out, your R&B I first ignore ya
Fuck Heavy D, cause ""I Got Nothin But HATE For Ya""!!
I'm Chino XL, now who the fuck are you?  I'm laughing
smashing you like a bottle of Zima
Oh now all of a sudden you got emphesema?
BURRNT, save that shit for rich verbatim days behind me
I'm yellow as hell, but I rip more BlackSTREET's than Teddy Riley
I'm not environmentally conscious so fuck an Earth Day on my worst day
I could kill more slanted eyes than a Japanese earthquake
and in the first place, Farrah couldn't Fawcett when I lost it
Give me that mic, you monkey motherfucker, you look exhausted!
When I'm tipsy, cut you like Bush cut Social Security
You couldn't make this crowd bounce like they one big silicone tittie
It ricochets, hear my name in projects hallways
Chino will amaze in so many different ways, what?

Fuck that when I bust that, watch this
I'm knockin niggaz out like they homosexual boxers
Now you feel like a building when the wrecking ball hits
I'M the type of nigga bitches like Brandy want to Be Down with
Not Howard Stern but get your temper burning, make you vomit
blood in slow motion like Tyra Banks go in Higher Learning
Enema, comma, coma, drama, dilemma, die like Dahmer
You can't see me like the Muppet Babies grand - mama
I'm a barbed wire condom once fuckin with that you'll - holler
My flows wet shit up like Barry White's shirt - collar
And I'm smoke Bones with mad Thugs we be in Harmony
But da-na-da-da-dahh-dah, just doesn't fuckin appeal to me
Disgustin me like Greg Lougainis AIDS my style is full blown
I'm wild like a latch key kid when his alcoholic daddy ain't home
Skip the silly facts is what you really lacks, your city give me daps
When Chino XL cuts you bleedin to death like hemophiliacs
Testin me is heresy I'm ill as leprosy I could make
Farrakhan grow dreads (BO BO!) and do the pepper seed
Spilling blood, similar to Exxon Valdez strike like a boa constrictor
Pain I inflict ya made ya scream like Little Richard
Battle me, no more props, no more fan mail admiration
You DIE, no time readin that for dramatization
You got your contract now you dissin me -- when you
barely own yourself like the Adams Family electricity
Bow your head in praise, the crowd sways when I hit the stage
Chino flips a phrase in so many different ways, uhh

Projecting my East coast semen all over ya (they be cloning ya)
I'm leaving em starving like they from Cambodia (nice knowing ya)
I'm telling ya fuck your cellular fuck your SkyPager
None of that can save ya when I SLASH ya with my rusty razor
In need of dry towels, my eye scowls, White Owls I split ya
Reposing like an Arthur Ashe before and after picture
My crew stay high like astronauts, this yellow bastard rocks
Still representin Jersey to the fullest -- Down at Fraggle Rock!
So now I rips again; leavin rappers whimperin
Makin my impression left in ears like discarded syringe
Cinematogrophy showin slides of your autopsy, no fair
I'm turning your whole projects into Tiannamen Square
Not number five like caps bust inside of Tupac's side
Rap side, not Pharcyde, burn your eyes like hydrogen peroxide
You better dodge this God that's lookin like DeBarge
Disgusting like an old white woman's medicinal discharge, swingin
my fist hard, causin viral spinal menengitis, when the slightest
vinyl coincides you risk dying to my violent twist
The Tin Ma -- if I only had a heart!  I wouldn't make
all y'all niggaz sit in the backseat like fuckin Rosa Parks
I represent them niggaz that make you one healthier
while you represent bad niggaz like Denzel in Philadelphia
I ruin more brothers with skills careers than Don King, yo
yo be	 stop the track here the phone is ringing I hear the phone ringing

Yo?			
""Yo Chino you look so good!
I just know you gotta a big dick
I want to fuck you so bad!""

Oh seven no one seventy the zip code I don't give a fuck
Throw an uppercut, was getting XL all fired up
worth getting your jaw all wired up?
Be a man like Me'shell N'degeocello, receive your ass-beating
I perform in front of more sellout crowds than a NAACP meeting
I'm making MC's look Dumber and Dumber like Jim Carrey
Go dig for David Cole I'm back in office like Marion Barry
My crew parleys while your girl braiding my braids
MC's are afraid in so Many Different Ways!

Chino XL,"Yeah, sometimes they come back

High pitched shrieks, my body lie dead in the streets
Yeahhh, my body lie dead in the streets
(repeat 4X)

The darkened clouds reflect my inner confusion
Frustrating feelings of dying too soon and I'm
sitting in plain view of Master and all of his glory
in purgatory, I'm not your everyday sinner
It's often viewed as stepping into a great light
with shadows of time, some people are forgotten in life
Move in past situations, stolen moments frozen proving
you ain't had a thing but evil in your human heart
It's startling, but I keep on following
The pain is mind-boggling, I hear angry souls hollering
High pitched shrieks, my body lie dead in the streets
Crackheads searching through my pockets too I see this all from side view
Now as I stand in the judgment of my forefathers
They agree I was murdered without my goal accomplished
Inside my heart is where the curse lay scared in the worst way
like a savior on the third day, I rise

Chorus:

""feel my aura, just around death's corner""
	(Rise!) Rise!
(repeat 4X)

The actual transition between death and life
reveals darks passageways, painted like stained glass
Soaking wet from the rain and my brain tired
and I'm barefooted freezing cold as I walk through fires
A child born with no soul signifies my return
from pure thought to put my killer's ashes in a urn
Outside the realm of light, demons dance in preparation
Weightless, only to be seen during incantation
Feel my aura, just around death's corner
Hands of liquid candlelit by a mourner (water)
Surrounding me it startles me, cry to me
Visions pushing me towards revenge and anger nothing's stopping me
What about this Crow it follows wherever I go
From a rooftop I see one of my killers in the window
Tears dwell up in my eyes, turn to highs, blood's
raining from the skies, as one of my murderers dies... rise

Chorus:

""The flesh is weak...""
	(Rise!) Rise!
(repeat 4X)

I believe... I believe
Yeah...

Yeah, I inhale the cold mist feeling lost
Like I'm in a dark forest that's illuminated by my soul
Like a Phoenix from the Earth watch me take flight
The world's in color when I walk it's all in black and white
I try to scream but no sound escapes, migraines
I shapeshift, I exist, she doesn't remain
Her name's etched in the walls of my nightmares
And levitates and elevates like flights of stairs
Second thoughts about karma but I can't cease
Without revenge, I think I'll never rest in peace
Blemishing, shaken like I'm off of heroin
I'm burrowing deep to reverse death, remembering
Now I rise like a zombie from the dirt I kill again
Feeling no better than what I am here to avenge
As we stand face to face you see death in my eyes
I won't destroy another man, the flesh is weak... rise

Chorus: (variations)

Sometimes death ain't even strong enough to stop living spirit
With our mind we call life into existence
Worlds are thoughts that are burning in me
Sometimes we come back

Chorus: (variations and outro)",Rise,1996

No type of compassion, endless my though process
hits like a dark cavern, I was bred of toxic parents
embryonic stages underdeveloped fetal pages that I burnt like phasers
Releasing human excrements on you like Tawana Brawley
Thinking to myself like Pee Wee Herman caught jerking off
I wish nobody saw me, wishing I could hide vibe cool Keith we spark

So when I rocks again get oxygen get cameras on

Riff riff raff, rappers make me giggle giggle laugh
From the East coast to Texas, I kick a rhyme like Pele
Strolling knee deep, you take a peep, while my beeper beep
Catchin wreck one two one two achoo achoo achoo
Sneezing and pleasing, on your ear, verbal easing
Chocolate flows then drips down through your nose
Between your legs, I bend your head with beer kegs
True, I'm blue, the smith can't stick to doo-doo
Yo Chino we needle we brown with the King Crown
Rockin underground bound, and pullin girls panties down
Yo check it, yo step with, you puppet muppet nitwit
Energizing like forty volts, I'm shocking to your anal
With my goggles paisano, Spiderman against the Rhino
Leaping on your building, downtown Los Angeles
Skandalous man, shooting sperm in your perm
Leaving ways to dry, my urine dropping in your eye
Burning afro puffs, with that greasy sticky stuff
I get rough, and plant my seed into your rectum
Masterbating at warp speed, I pull up in your spectrum

No handicap love, elephants on the fence
Ever since dinosaurs, people stood on Crenshaw
And palace fade shopping lades, you never saw before
Bouncing down with more bounce, with music by the ounce
With my finger between the mean California labia

Chino XL,"Yo I don't even know what the vibe is kid
All these different things seperatin us
It got me walkin this fence man
and I don't even know what side I'ma fall on be	
Can't see it

Well I'm a zebra y'all
(""Half Puerto Rican, half black, but you don't speak Spanish"")
Don't call me zebra y'all
(""Half Puerto Rican, half black..."")

	Now how old are you?

About six, on my BMX, doin tricks
Back to Middlesex with a couple of poor white trashy brats
Everything was coochie crunch till it was time for lunch
They said to wait in the back, they said that Pops ain't like black
See where I was the population's mostly white
	Ain't it?
They want to see you jiggaboo with your
	face painted
Be brought home by one of their daughters and their fathers
	fainted
They want to see you a failure so I never
	became it
Light-skinned, showed them lead, curly-headed
Called me names, I was different, I was gifted, they made me ashamed
Found out that I'm a different shade when I'm in the second grade
Abe Lincoln's play, they want me to portray a slave
My momma's face went pale she looked like she wanted to puke
Now that I know the truth I'd rather play John Wilkes Booth
Although my family came and bitched and in the play my role was switched
My grandma told me I was fixed my problems wasn't fixed
My family seen my views of the world distort
Moms last resort, she decided we would move to Newark
I took a deep breath leaving everything I knew behind
The country air the green grass and my piece of mind
Harassed by white cops on our way we're pulled out our car
Mistook my mom for Joanne Chessimar (?) now I'm really scarred

	<>

What am I, I'm confused, can't decide
What am I who am I what am I
Black or white, I can't identify
What am I who am I what am I
I'm confused, can't decide
What am I who am I what am I
Black or white, I can't identify
What am I who am I what am I

Culture shock, Newark's a far cry from Middlesex
Broadly called projects, black eyes, regrets
Torn lives, I've never seen so many people depressed
My mental gets molested, physical takes violent threats
Stress, walkin home from school's like a terrorist test
I learned blacks could be racist too, somehow still I felt I was blessed
Even my teachers called me half-breeds and all of that
I was scared of livin here but also scared of movin back
See where I was before I was the darkest thing they ever saw
They figured that I'm black, white around
They kick me like a soccer ball
White people didn't accept me
	Fuck you
Black people didn't accept me
	Fuck you
Puerto Ricans didn't accept me
	Fuck you
Diggin researchin my identity it gots me goin cuckoo

""I'm the yellow nigga right?
 I'm tired of that.  I am not passing, I am black!
 I was born black, I live black,
 and I will die, proud to be called black!""

So now I'm goin ""Hey niggaz"" at niggaz that say Chino's not black
They come to my house and tell my African mother that
In fact causin crackup they said no sister would attract to me
These same brothers got perms to get their hair like mine was naturally
Descrimination, affects a brother's education
Hands up in black history class, they never called on my ass
But wait, growin at a rapid rate
I digest their hate, it's family
Found out my father left me when I'm three
Dealt with felt if I knew my Spanish family they'd help
Every mixed person I met they mostly just kept to themself
We moved to East Orange I set it off talent shows staring
A high yellow nigga's progression, my flavor's pouring

<>

	Now how old are you?

About nineteen lettin off my steam
Used to be a punchin bag, but now I stomps, in hip-hop fiend
Now I get the goya jokes, Menudo jokes, Rico Suave jokes
But females rush me and the MC's steal up all my quotes
See what I lacks in melanin I makes up wit adrenalin
Your weak attempts at blemishin my mixed heritage I'm treasurin
Don't need caucausian acceptance just that of a human being
Laughed and spit at I don't represent cause I am not Spanish speaking
Now how many dues must I pay to win
You're angry and you're stressin that oppression
but you judge me by the skin I'm in when
Adam Clayton Powell's, light-skinned and
Farrakhan the brother's, light-skinned and
Elijah Muhammad's also, light-skinned
Discrimination from my own peoples is making my temper go thin so
So stop playing me slight saying my song's aight instead of hype
Don't called me red-boned, or light and bright and damn they're white
I ain't no zebra, ain't no half of original either
Don't call me mulatto I stab you with a broken bottle
Callin your brother oreo get off it yo, now Tom consider
He could be like Chino XL, a yellow ass nigga

Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned

Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9nes's vild""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down

Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays

Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of Jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway and Tech

I'm Chino X, bring K-R-S in

De de de de de de da di day, K-R-S-One comin' wit' the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect

Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway and Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of Jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway and Tech

De de de de de de da di day, K-R-S-One comin' wit' the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do

Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter

FRESH, FOR NINETY-NINE YOU SUCKAS!!!",The Anthem [Main],1999
Chino XL,"(Yeah yo, follow this, follow this, yeah)
She just appeared out of nowhere
At this club it's kind of freaky so I usually don't go there
She will dance with no care
And I was kinda sleepy so to revive I step into the cold air
Who came behind me it was her, wind blowing in hair
She said ""Let's take a ride we could slide to anywhere""
I said ""Look but don't stare""
She said ""It's hard not to a nigga like you in here? It's kinda rare""
Seven-forty I-L, I look cushion in chair
Kinda feeling alright, I was supt in her ear
What do you want from me? I don't have much to share
She said ""Her husband was rich but he was never there
And know she want a affair and this is where I come in
Said she was prepared to help me with my career
So she said I heard I could rhyme and she had lot's of friends
Before we began I told her one thing

[Chorus]
I didn't have to be here
You didn't have to look for me
When I was just a nothing-child, and I know our times are wild
But before this ride is through, and you know I love fucking you
But I didn't ask to be here
You wanted me to be here
I really shouldn't be here
I didn't have to be here

Yo, we started to get really close
She started spoiling me right away ?doing? credit card's and clothes
She bought a weed from East Coast
I had been in LA for three month's now, but I'm from East Coast
She kept me in a Navigator Rental
Introduced me to her famous producer and payed for my demo
Set it album we was done
Champagne hosts for my future my life had finally begun
Tossed and turned all night, said she just couldn't rest she was feeling
Distressed about a hubby distressed
Too many sleeping pills I think she tried to overdose (Uh-huh)
Her man and me sometimes I wonder who she love the most? (Uh-huh)
Crazy of life of mine yo it's hard to believe
People feeling my tape, ended up getting signed!
Money for the first time for my rhyme
She started acting up like she didn't want me to shine

[Chorus]

And now, I'm unavailable too take your phone call, you know what to do

(Yo, why I'm bugging you? You know what I'm saying?)

Yo, yo, everything started happening kinda fast
I was well know getting cash over last
I can't remember when I spoke to my baby last
Younger man with a older woman were part of my past
Everyday different show's and sometimes different hoe's (Uh-huh)
When I am on video's I wonder if she knows?
How I miss her in my life and how we used to hang
'Cause just then the phone rang
I picked up she said ""What up?""
I'm like ""I miss you honey""
She said ""You wouldn't have been nothing if it wasn't for me""
That kinda hurt me  that she was so admitted wasn't being there
I thought we both got something outta this?
You made this happen for me and everybody know that
But you refuse to stay in-touch, you choose that!
They want to be happy and you see sad through it (nah) and I ain't know your
Love had a price-tag to it
Besides, you were married women I was just on the side (uh-huh) and now I'm
Pushing a six and getting hard to hide (uh-huh)
About her husband she shot him to death
They find him dead next to him was a note that said:

Caught a taxi to my crib, roughft up my six
Full throttle to you crib, crying and shit
Should of listen, cause we was like, night and day
Should of seen it, you break my heart, anyway
But I lost my mind you hit my spot when you made love to me
Was you loving me or fucking me when you was inside me?

?????????
Insecure, get it from a girl that's yours when the streets beat you up and
You can't take no more
And that life style you living, lead's you to back to my door
Tell me, I played the fuel forever, as long as you and I could stay
together forever

Throwing their panties on stage's for me like Maxwell

You know who I'm coming home to, I'm blush you
Just giving problem's, trying to trick me to marriage like Carmen Electra

When I provided you with Benz, Jeeps, beepers, and Jewels
She confused, it's my apartment

I turned your little sexy ass out
Sorry
You got the key's to my apartment and house

And you didn't even love me, you just like fucking my rib's
Take the key's off the dresser let you stuck at the crib
And I don't even swallow cum 
I give's a fuck who you is
Now your ass fill you's with my ???? on your ????

Sorry

Momma said you only wanted my wealth
Still I ended up loving you more than I love myself
Five year's prom bitches taking down off the shelf

In the Court House, I'm wilding out, you my housekeeper
(Uh) We split up and the judge let you keep the house

Sorry

We not even legal I'm tripping
The only rain you was getting was around the bathtub after you finish stripping
Apologies? Save 'em all for your Priests

Did I reach you out and hold you, in my lovely arm's?

What the fuck? yea, yea... chargin why'all niggaz
Yea, yea... behold the only thing greater than yourself

You'll be the only entertainer with less groupies than Biz Markie
I'm never dull, Chino the pretty thug, style centerfold,
I'll have every latin in the country aimin' at ya skull
I'll aim it at the ((?)) who claim he sellin' the most dope
My Jersey blocks is locked tighter than prisoners hold soap
And listeners where we vote out ya CD and vinyl, the final result
Yell, fuck tricks and smoke, till our vocals combine with a Colt

Fear is a stimulus I haven't been programmed to feel yet
Snatch you outta your Roots like I'm from Illadelph
What I do to push your hairline back, Rogaine won't help
My Quest for the Wealth, like Stone Cold Austin's quest for the belt
I mention myself as a celestial cell, an extension of hell
At a lynching I smile, cut myself down, murder your guest list
My style murders an drags like they do black men in Texas
Next rapper to mention this, I'ma show them the real threat
Cause I'ma ride till my daughter's like ""Daddy are we there yet?""
Ain't no priest in the streets, only drugs before miracles
Seen more keys than the lots seen Hammers repossessed vehicles
Told you I was coming, you ain't believe I'm assumin'
If we all super heroes, these bitch niggaz must be Wonder Women
Fist to fist, skin to skin, I make you fall flat
Brat little niggaz, the tat on my shoulder cover they whole back
Can't hold back, splatter they whole rap to match my ((?))

Least but not last, I'll blast an informant
Until he has the cash to put end to his torment
Now shine up the brass for his coffin
I've mastered the ((?)), through passion and torment
I've mastered the forces, I rap to the chorus,
My cast is enormous, I'm fast and I'm cautious
Twenty inch arms stronger than forklifts
Smoke hash in front of reporters till I choke and they nauseous
And smash through the glass of your Porsche's
Show you how north is hard as divorces
Lay you out dead in the grass on the forest
My rap is flawless, have ya flesh wrapped in a blackened sausage
Blood Splashed across it for rhymin' like a fag in a cordless
Murder all witnesses, nosy, standing on porches,
Like torches, super human, Chino's skin never scorches
Drape your family reunion in black funeral mourners
Have cats that sell ya drugs for you, avoid usual corners
I never lost, there's mad lust to be Rap carasses
Breakin' companies, Jersey got women strapped inside they office
I got.. DJ supporters and women makin' sex offers
I got.. a crib like a fortress, tuition for all my daughters
I got.. rhymes hot like sauna's, and thousands from Time Warner
I got.. killas on every corner, surrounded by Jewish lawyers

Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

Random one cop killa, hip-hop has never been realer
Volume 2 shot up the president like a gorilla
New York police state capital tried to swallow me
Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy?
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslum girl and fuck her five times a day (WHAT?)
Every time right before we shower and pray (HA!)
You damn right the AK, symbolizes Jihad
But a holy war, is a conversation with God
You bitch niggaz misinterpret what you don't understand
Stackin the wrong sign can end up, shootin your man
Shootin each other, shootin your brother
Aim the gun at the right motherfucker
And leave him colder than the prison in Russia
Or America's white power structure
Niggaz love to say ""Fuck revolution!""
Until the jury comin and move for the prosecution
And them brothers act like a born-again Huey Newton
Forgot about the bullshit music they was producin
But my niggaz aim precisely, through the confusion - AND

I got a hundred shooters with me, Rugers shoot you through the kidney
Stand in front of the judge and lie quicker than Scooter Libby
I'm runnin through the city - dear God
If I murk the racist Rush Limbaugh I wonder would you forgive me? (Huh?)
Somebody told me glim back as the plan's over
See ya, time to let him see a damn soldier
Flip your Landrover, I told ya I blam toasters
Gun pop off like the mouth of Ann Coulter
This is my gangsta religion
See I aim with precision, point blank the position
I'm black as them ancient Egyptians
Before European historians went and changed the description
I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen
The C.I.A. playin with the pigeons, same pain that I'm pitchin (yea)
Listen, you dudes better watch the hook
I'm a boxer, coppers'll come up, Hoffa look
They wanna get rid of this conscious crook
Like I'm a Gnostic, apocryphal, non-canonical Gospel book
But I ain't goin nowhere, that's the motherfuckin truth
America don't care for its inner city youth - so I

Cop murdered by the certain burner turned in the back of his sternum
He flirted with pullin me over for bein brown, I bust
Now he in the back of the truck with Don Imus
I must, take aim when I lick shots
Throw stray bullets like when Nas got off of Pharoahe Monch
These pigs wanna see us dead inside a jail cell
Turn us from Shawn Carter to Shawn Combs to Sean Bell
My temper 'bout to break like levees in New Orleans
Catch Jimmy Iovine when he refinance his mortgages
Kid illusion is dead, we movin with the blue and the red
Latin Kings, Giuliani with a gat to his head
Y'all don't lick shots like killers aimin at the Feds
Y'all lick shots like Jenna Jameson and Superhead
Pigs slice to Venice and beef at the benefits meet
Buried him on Venice Beach with the flies and the bees

Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit, get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit, get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit, welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is, Tech N9ne!

[Tech N9ne]
This is style I use pitch, to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switching the pattern, bust out that quick midwest chatter
Some people hate but it ain't mattering, but the people gather, it's flattering
Switching the pitch, mixing, there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spitting full clips on a mission for bliss when I be ripping this shit
Make it exciting, got to be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding, if you're going to be biting, you're igniting the beast
This is melodic, melodies, if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singing off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction, don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

From our west coast instructor, Crooked I (Crooked I)

[Crooked I]
My killer Daytons can keep me crushing the competition
Coming correct when creating the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missing
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty, if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm putting swag in my style (in my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Chorus]

From our east coast instructor, Chino XL

[Chino XL]
Everybody start locking their windows and doors, Chino might get in
It's like lightning, how I'm striking a trifling rifleman
Bullets flying up and I'm numbing the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling! (yeah!)
Chino be curdling blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana, than half of you rappers on the radio!
Starting drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
with a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van (damn)
I'm demented, spitting writtens as sick as I can
Grenade gripping, fitting to detonate Disneyland
I am teaching Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Chorus]

Yes I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

For those who don't know what the fuck's going on
This is Sickology 101, you punk motherfuckers!

Chino XL,"Ayo Kane found Logan lamping at Deluca's
Sitting with a little black boy, she called him Lucas, he knew it
Found himself the daughter of a kingpin
The ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win
His seed, the grief filled up in his eyes
He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!
M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
This is just the fuckin tip of the storm!
Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!
As soon as he step in the building
AMBUSH!

At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate
Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]
The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place
He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench 
of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No light or water, arms and legs bound

But there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
I'm ready to get involved with the revolving [?] warehouse all by myself
I dive underground finding rounds
[?]

I am delivering death's invitation",Death's Invitation,2015
Chinua Hawk,"Dear you, yeah, you, the person listenin'
It's God, usin' me, tryin' to get your attention, yeah
See, He remembers the first day that He made you
Molded your lungs for the breath that He gave you
Not to mention the day He saved you
And when He opened your eyes by the spirit Christ was raised through
Did I mention that He forgave you?
And had His flesh ripped off for the sin you was enslaved to
Now it seems you too far gone, you wanna turn back
But you're unsure if you'll be welcome home
So you figure you just leave it alone
But you're addicted to yourself, we both know you can't see it alone
This is an intervention, Jesus intervened
He intercedes on behalf of a sinner's deeds
This is an intervention because the Lord hurts
Before it gets worse, start making a reverse

I pay You no attention, lose my direction, all I chase is vanity
I forget I've been forgiven, your love I been given, you graced on me lavishly
You were born on earth, on the cross you died for me
You forgive my depravity, You are my reality

With cold water we drink, hot water we cook
But lukewarm does nothin', it just sits and it looks
If that's you, imagine these as the words of Christ
""I remember you loved me, I remember your light
It used to shine bright, but now it's so dim
It used to be about us, but now it's 'bout them
You can't win playin' heart games
But I love you even when your light's off in your dark shame
When you lay down and profane me
Or when your bloodstream contains the things that would defame me
When nobody knows that you claim me
Or when you mess your life up, get mad, and wanna blame me
I still want you back, I won't punish you
I took that on the cross, because I wanted you
I might discipline and chastise
But if you got what you deserve you'd be in hell with other bad guys""

I pay You no attention, lose my direction, all I chase is vanity
I forget I've been forgiven, your love I been given, you graced on me lavishly
You were born on earth, on the cross you died for me
You forgive my depravity, You are my reality

You made it this far, and that's a big move
But your addiction is hurting your other friends too
Some of 'em miss you, some of 'em dissed you
But they was hurt and struggling to forgive you
And they hated how addiction got the best of you
Chose a lie when God promised the best for you
If you realize you're livin' in sin
Just confess and realize you're forgiven of sin

I pay You no attention, lose my direction, all I chase is vanity
I forget I've been forgiven, your love I been given, you graced on me lavishly
You were born on earth, on the cross you died for me
You forgive my depravity, You are my reality",New Reality,2010

I was drunk, getting high with my guys, didn't care 'bout nothing

Ever since they first hit me up, wasn't supposed to live
Still on the block getting money where I’m supposed to live
They want to see my casket shine, hope mama front row
Tears in her eyes, heart bleeding, the boy have to go
I can see Puff telling Ross, Yela was a legend
I can see my baby-mama mad, it ain't fresh
And I be mad

Young niggas out here, let the blammer go
Mixing mud with the smoke, I’m paranoid
Got a couple kittens that’s down to go
And when they come, I’ll be there mining coal
Suckas living a lie
Out here blessing all my niggas and I’m living the life
Got a couple foreign bitches and they put up a fight
If I told you what I know, I’m probably doing a life

Teacher used to say that I’d amount to nothing
Kept the work up in that kitchen cupboard
Whipped it like I baked it in that easy oven

Buddhas to Jewish, every religion is Judas
Nigga due to all my circumstances
Had no choice but roll the dice, had to take the chances
'Till my homies leave the can, they just tuna fish
No money orders from the fam, just get through the shit
Youngins dying nowadays, dressed-up in the ghetto
The struggle all by the system, these crackers turn you Gepetto
I’m loading up in that hoopty to catch a 187
I flipped and got me a Rolex, preacher got the same Bezel
What the fuck, some nights I couldn’t sleep 'cause Satan woke me up
Been through shit that make you cry, have you choking up
Find yourself in the darkest places loading them nines
Tryna grip your mind, searching, you search what you find
Came up with jack-shit up out that wishing well
Left with this black skin and a digital scale

When that money coming in the feds closing on the shop
Standing on the couches, bottle Ace and bottle Rose
Doze off in the trap and had a dream about a Rolls
Got some niggas locked cause they done played it by the code
Made a killing off the block but now we do that off the shows
Don’t be tripping on the phone lines
Got a brick and turned my block into a gold mine
Nigga end up in a cell and I’ma hold mine

Shootout with the police, like Seigel did it
Middle of the streets, like the Beatles did it
Can't be in it when you leave, or they leave you in it
Everything that's gold ain't what it glitter

Have your money right, when the law call
I seen my favorite rappers turn to calm ball
The best thing I did was let the pain hurt my feelings
Turn the pain into music
Turn the music into millions
Got jerked my first deal, now I tell 'em suck a dick
Once I make my first mil, told 'em fuck a brick
Brick, brick by brick, 'til it's empire
Lick by lick, go and sleep wide
Had to learn taxes, help you relax
If you don't own your map, then classics turn to ashes

Promise, that pressure turn to diamonds
The comma turn to commas

Trips out to Cabo, D.C with the models
There's Tammy from Miami
Put her face on the white like Sosa
Come and get a close up

From the hoodies to the Tom Ford
Big up, for the stick up
They wanted me to hiccup
I copped a Bent' over sticker
I'm 'bout to come and pick your chick up

Godfather trilogy, Al Pacino shoot
This that Benny Blanco 'fore he killed Carlito
This that Larry Davis before he caught the RICO
Them Bronx streets, teflon fleets
In the jungle, while you holding hands in Palm Beach
We was climbing fences, we was playing benches
One time for my bitches, naked on the trenches
European boots, European suits
African diamonds, my nigga shining
My nigga Chinx's son became my own son

Off the Mary Jane, pills, syrup, thick smoke, coughing

Ballin', took the whistle from the ref and made my own calls
Fuck the pigs, got my homie on a phone call

Rarely skating, but your car flick diamonds only

Coming out through my throat,
Regret and failure,
The need to keep you coming back for more.

And I'm so much better now that I'm far from you,
This passion drowns our need for love.
No, we can't stop even if we wanted to,
This passion drowns our need for love.

And this is all still so new to me,
Our eyes have lost their color.
And now I'm trying, I'm trying to keep my balance.
But there is nothing, there's nothing to keep me steady.
And I'll hold myself up.

And I'm so much better now that I'm far from you,
This passion drowns our need for love.
No, we can't stop even if we wanted to,
This passion drowns our need for love.
I'm so much better now that I'm far from you,
This passion drowns our need for love.
No, we can't stop even if we wanted to,
This passion drowns our need for love.

Chiodos,"So, here I am again, both of my eyes
So open wide and gleaming
Blank stares with races
Running only an inch behind

Sit back and watch the pavement
Get closer as it aims for your face
As it aims for your face
So step back, let me take over
Step back, let me take over

Can you hear the silhouettes
The slim and dark figures
Rising like giants out of the shadows
They're crawling out, they're crawling out of our skin

Here I am again, we build ourselves
Where monsters used to hide
So step back, let me take over
So step back, let me take over

And we're all whores
Some of us just get paid

Oh, how we celebrate the mediocrity
My feelings crawl the walls
They crawl the walls and finally fall
They finally fall like empires and old loves

Can you hear the silhouettes?

Rising like giants out of the shadows
They're crawling out, they're crawling out of our skin

Chiodos,"I had visions, I was in them,
I was looking into the mirror
To see a little bit clearer
The rottenness and evil in me

Fingertips have memories,
Mine can't forget the curves of your body
And when I feel a bit naughty
I run it up the flagpole and see who salutes
(But no one ever does)

I'm not sick, but I'm not well
and I'm so hot 'cause I'm in hell

Been around the world and found
That only stupid people are breeding
The cretins cloning and feeding
And I don't even own a TV

Put me in the hospital for nerves
And then they had to commit me
You told them all I was crazy
They cut off my legs now I'm an amputee, goddamn you

I'm not sick, but I'm not well
and I'm so hot 'cause I'm in hell

I'm not sick, but I'm not well
And it's a sin, to live so well

I wanna publish 'zines
And rage against machines
I wanna pierce my tongue
It doesn't hurt, it feels fine
The trivial sublime
I'd like to turn off time
And kill my mind
You kill my mind
Mind

Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's comin' to get me
Just say you never met me
I'm runnin' underground with the moles
Diggin' holes
Hear the voices in my head
I swear to God it sounds like they're snoring
But if you're bored then you're boring
The agony and the irony, they're killing me, whoa!

I'm not sick, but I'm not well
and I'm so hot 'cause I'm in hell

I'm not sick, but I'm not well
And it's a sin to live this well",Flagpole Sitta,2009
Chiodos,"Are you ready to take a chance and risk it all?
It's do or die, fight or flight
Do you want to feel alive? (Feel alive)
So would you play a game of
Russian roulette to save your life?
Are you in?
Are you in?

Or will you flee to safety
And wonder what could've been?
Don't be afraid,
Don't ever be afraid
Oh, you've been hiding
You've been hiding
You've been hiding in the shadows

Don't let it weigh you down
You gotta get out of there
When you're afraid,
When you're afraid
Take a chance,
Don't let it weigh you down
You gotta get out

Falling back to the comfort of your world
The last time you walked away from this,
You were looking back to see what you missed

I never thought it would be like this
It's 3 AM and I can't sleep

I had it all planned out find a girl and get married,
Do things that make your dreams.
Oh look at me, what more could you need?
I knew that I could win a room because I've always had it,
But love is a scary thing.
It's what they never taught
And I don't know how its gotten me this far

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless,
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM.

I wish I would of loved you instead of being selfish
And being so obsessed with my dreams
Oh look at me I'm surrounded by the lonely
I thought I could win you back
Because I've always had it but love is a tricky thing
It's what they never taught,
That you when lose what you love,
You lose a piece of your heart

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless,
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM.

I'm here because I wouldn't change

That some of y'all gone have to go through man everybody on the sound
of my voice (This from the soul)
Everything gone be cool man, From Boys to Men

[Verse 1] Pastor Troy
No one to doubt me, I'm not here lonely
Childhood secrets still wid my homies
I recall days when I blazed up on the hill
Not knowin' wud the future would hold, just kept it real
We ridin' on the 'Lac with the boys to other schools
We catch 'em at dey football games and act a fool
And everybody know my name, it's Michael Troy
We made all them bullies respect Falcon Boy
I got my folks worried, I'm suspended everyday
Sometimes I ain't tell 'em and caught the train to the A
The FirePoint Station, Supreme location
I'm only 15, tho at the lil' scene

No one to pry me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
He'd shelter from the rain..to ease the pain
Changing from boys to men

[Verse 2]
I've done seen stabbings, i've done seen shootings
I've done seen a robbery, i've done seen two
But I ain't even 15, so when i turn 16
I'm'ma get dat chrome thing wid da beam
My team was da wreckin' crew, like juice
The type of niggas on our side do, who was the truth
I bet them killaz on his side respect game
That other nigga from the southside, was lame
My name is Stone, Charlestown to the bone
Lil' Wayne and Scooby, we rocking MCM and Gucci
I'm nine years old, that nigga let me touch a Uzi
I wanted to kill, just like i saw up in the movie
No wonder one of my friend shot himself in his head
Playin' wid the gun from under his mothers bed
Don't want to call his name too tough, we'll call him Fred
We watch my nigga while he bled (when we was young)

[Verse 3] Eight-ball
Lord knows we be tryin hard, God watching over us
Mama told me ""baby dun be goin to school cuttin up""
Did I listen, hell naw, listen let me tell ya'll
Streets transform mamas only into eight-ball

See my +Chilouette+ like I'm +Alfred Hitchcock+ and they know its me
Bottom line met a lot of niggaz on the grind 
getting them dimes
Murder they ass, escape the scene like I committed the crime
A friend of mine, don't rap he doing illegal business
18-Wheeler, Fed, X, bricks, did wid killaz
He smoke and dipped'em drunk with Crys and get to beating his bitches
Them bitches down though, come straight back after they get through strippen
I'm outta' town, next to the church see his lil' brotha cryin
Told me his brotha killed himself, I said nigga you lyin

Just how deep my feelings go
I'm not sure I tell you enough
How lost I'd be without your love.

I often hurry through the day
Never stopping long enough to say
How much you really mean to me
So I'll tell you with no uncertainty.

With all my heart, with all my soul
I will love you 'til the winds don't blow
Until the oceans turn to stone
I am yours and yours alone
My love is forever until forever's gone.

Please, forgive me if sometimes
Life comes between your heart and mine
When it appears I've shut you out
Remember this, you're all that really counts.

Get in my way, when I do,

Chip Fu,"I am Posdnous 
I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 

But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 
Product of a North Carolina cat 
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie 
Who departed life just a little too soon 

And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame 
As we go a little somethin' like this 
Look ma, no protection 
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay 

And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough 
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay 
I am an early bird but the feathers are black 
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms 

But it's a must to decipher one's queen 
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ 
I cherish the twilight 
I maximize, my soul is the right size 

I watch for the power to run out on the moon 
(And that'll be sometime soon) 
Faker than a fist of kids 
Speakin' that they're black 

When they're just niggas trying to be Greek 
Or some tongues who lied 
And said ""We'll be natives to the end"" 
Nowadays we don't even speak 

I guess we got our own life to live 
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? 
Every now and then I step to the now 
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool 

Now I won't apologize for it 
This is not a bunch of Bradys 
But a bunch of black man's pride 
Yet I can safely say 

I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside 
I've always walked the right side of the road 
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs 
But a man with a plan 

And if I was a rug cleaner 
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am.  
The Plug Two brand with the flavour 
In the flute watch the sniffin' 

So a sack of shows in demand 
I read the diction from the second page 
I got the one-two gauge 
Baritone to the izm fan 

Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink 
So let me need ya to my ems go 
I push the infinite and carry it 
My carrier's the three over one 

So my pluggins already know 
Lick shots with moo 
Catch the boo 
From a ghost in the heckling crowd 

If I give a foot 
Jack Ville caught a spill 
When a still came from my mouth 
I brought a head down south 

I don't check for the noose and the neck 
So I never tell my ems 
That finesse is knocking at my door 
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun 

And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore 
I bring the element H with the 2 
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade 
It's just mind over matter 

And what matters is 
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade 
I keep the walking on the right side 
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 

'Cause that's how he wants to be 
No difference, see 
I want to be like the name of this song I am 
I am Posdnous 

I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 
But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 

The deeds of a natural 
Are seeds that are no longer planted 
So the famine in the mind is strong 
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane 

Sane enough to let you know from within this song 
I stabilize many cableized viewers 
So my occupation's known 
But not why I occupy 

And that is to bring the peace 
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am",I Am I Be,1993

He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon

And it's chilly today, the kids are going to school

Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out, in the morning
Hello Cleveland

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
""Wonder what them folks on?"" That's what they be asking
That kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga pass and
We getting to the cash and, you can see a nigga shining
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find 'em, unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
'Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves
On out and free my scalp
I need to free my mind, a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Dont really like sipping 'cause I get to tripping
My nigga just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a lil bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by the 5-0
""Sir you look high""
""I know, but I prefer my eyes low""

And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher

You know we get higher, so higher, oh, oh yeah we get so high

Yeah, they say easy friend
There he go talking about weed again
Probably 'cause all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss what
A nigga trying to get you thinking about
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff puff pass with your bitch ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict
Tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down see my Jesus piece shining
Good look Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling Jack
Let's go

And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher

Never play a nigga when you see that he is tying to grow
Candy blocker when he knocked out ?
Empty chamber so I'm watching every angle

Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I'm
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin' about really killin' them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I'll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
We wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing that this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They passes move was to slow for me
I pulled up, wasn't no ambulance, there wasn't no police
Something fishy going on, not even kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me

Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

No more tests
Comes the day you say, 'What for?'

They disappoint in turn, I fear
Forgive, though, they won't

No more jests
No more curses you can't undo, left by fathers you never knew
No more quests
No more feelings. Time to shut the door

Free from the ties that bind
No more despair, or burdens to bear
Out there in the yonder
Running away, go to it

Have to take care unless there's a 'where'
You'll only be wandering blind
Just more questions different kind
Where are we to go?
Where are we ever to go?
Running away, we'll do it
Why sit around, resigned?
Trouble is, son, the farther you run
The more you'll be wandering blind
For what you have left undone, and more
What you've left behind
We disappoint, we leave a mess, we die, but we don't

We disappoint in turn, I guess. Forget, though, we won't

Can't we just pursue our lives, with our children and our wives

We're wishing them the best,

This is catch two-two, I'm age two-two, 
Spent like two-two on a black out coupe, 
Wanna know how I'm looking lately, 
Don't stare through limousine tints that's rude, 
I break necks I'm a real head turner, 
And back then I was a first time learner, 
I skipped classes, straight to the masters, 
Now look I'm a skyline earner, 
Cash in hand no finance

When we cash in grands it's violent, 
Chipmunk co-pilots the airlines, 
So flee we land on next islands, 
I topped the bill, we can't relate 
'cause you earn the bill, $100, 
There's chrome on the grills, 
No less than 19's on the wheels, 
Back to the music wheel this, 
I flow crazy, mental illness, brainless, 
But I'm amazing grace so thy shall feel this, 
I'm raising the bar, your waistline, 
I liaise with stars on cloud nine, 
Wings on my back, skydive, 
It's over, wrap, night time.

My collar I pop, I'm heavy I pop, 
I'm heavy on grime, I'm heavy on rock, (anything) 
And the garments speak for themselves, 
Your outfit cost the same as my belt

Five bills, 
So don't question me about wealth, 
You get a pair I get the shelf, 
And that was before the deal, 
Assassinate versus born to kill, 
Colder tham Neptune's, so Pharall, 
I mean for real, you know the deal, 
You know the drill

Yeah G, I nail it, I talk money, more so, I make it, 
And Tinchy don't boast too much, 
But his stack is not what his name is, 
'Munk, it's not what my name is, 
I've got money coming out of my anus, 
I set trends, don't follow what the craze is,

My shit does stink, I'm human too, 
So why should I make a man violate me, 
If you don't ever make a man violate you.

Yeah I'm in the limelight, but what can I do,

I was lookin' up to men that made money off of drugs,

Like who the hell said money can't but love,

More city learners are relevant outta class, 
Teach the kids to get A's and shit, 
But don't tell a man to get mortgages,

Oh oh oh, you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings 
Because my new diamond rings
They're what's in 
And if you're looking at me
You gon' be looking at them 
'Cause they're the swagger that you see in my walk 
And if you're listening to me
You gon' be listening to them 
'Cause they're the slick that you hear in my talk 

Hit me one screen, West End 
(Flawless) shine like I'm a girl's best friend (diamonds) 
Girls see me and scream 'cause I'm on the TV
But I still take walks in my ends 
Fourteen when I entered the game 
All I wanted was a little bit of fame (just a bit) 
And now I'm fuckin' with the grown-ups 
Go mad like, shit, I forgot my age 
Oh, Chipmunk, you so cute 
I'm a call you the Diamond Dude 
And my rings got so many carrots 
And you usually call this rabbit food 
And the styles is custom made 
No water involved, I pay 
Good Lord, I remember the days 
I pray for Roland Cartier

Ey, ah, see I'm such a classy guy (yeah, I know) 
Designer shades hide my eyes 
I know, Lord, with a face like mine 
How the hell could I be camera shy (tell me that)
I make it look easy, man 
But that don't mean that it's easy man (no, it ain't) 
I got my middle finger up to the world 
With a ring on the thing 'cause I froze my hand 
Yeah, in that position, right back, clear your position 
I'm everythin' you're not, you work, I'm a boss 
I reverent run this, man 
And I could turn your house into mine 
And I could turn your girl into mine (one time) 
I'm a stay in my grind, you could be that, on my life 
Never let a nigga take my shine

Chipmunk,"Coming loose, at the seams
Blind spots, voices
Controls gone, I'm like a balloon
Cut it out, emotion

Distance, it grows now
You don't, reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

Save me give me wings to fly
Make me young reason to fight
Suddenly we'll cross a home
Remember me into the night

Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Fairy tales make up

Headlight, black demons
Peering in my hollow core
Grudges they're strangling
and splinters and dry skin

Streetlights they see me
The whole world will reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

Save me give me wings to fly
Make me young reason to fight
Suddenly we'll cross a home
Remember me into the night

Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Fairy tales make up

I'll kiss then you'll wake up
Don't want to meet your maker
And you don't believe in fairy tales
Well today I'm gonna make ya

'Cause I've come here to save ya
Finna none of that miss I'ma take ya
I can rap I can rhyme like karma
Be your night in armor

Oh no I ain't got no Porsche
Just give me a shield and a sword and a horse
And I'll come ridin' ridin' ridin'
Give me a little one on the back

I'ma tell a lie and get you on back
I'ma tell a lie and get you on back
It's gone right from fiction to fact
I'm gonna take you out this world

Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Fairy tales make up

Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Fairy tales make up",Scars,2009
