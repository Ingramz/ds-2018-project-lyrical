Hillsong Young & Free,"One day when Heaven was filled with His praises
One day when sin was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He
Word became flesh and the light shined among us
His glory revealed

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled away from the door
Then He arose, over death He had conquered
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore
Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him
From rising again

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away

One day the skies with His glories will shine

A comfy seat, pump this beat, Pressure will set the occasion,
For your entertainment I work hard on my flows,
This scene is full of falling MCs I wear hardhats to shows,
And every hip hop head's a critic, 'cause some hit the stage hard,
But couldn't get these arseholes open at a gay bar,
It's a comedy festival; they're so unintelligible,
Can't work out if they got peas for brains, or they're just vegetables,
It's sounds pathetic as me being anorexic,
I do damage like a paralytic, paramedic with no anaesthetic,
Girls shake my hand, guys want to hug me it's a worry,
If I forgot your name I'm sorry, you're probably pretty ugly,
I'm scared of getting old, so when it comes D-Day,

I screwed all these MCs, yeah? Then it got awkward,
It got weird didn't itâ?¦

Break it down like a molecule, we burning like fossil fuel,

Hilltop Hoods,"Verse One â?? Suffa
Let me introduce myself, raise them beers,
Suffa MC, been doing this for more than ten years,
Ever since I was a youngster, I brought the funk for
The love, and for the party people to get drunk to,
Since back in the day we've been the major crew,
When I step on the stage it's like De Ja Vu,
Years of performing, years of practice,
Respect from my peers, my girls tears on the mattress,
Every time that we went on tour,
And she was left behind feeling insecure,
But she needn't worry; I wasn't chasing a girl to rock right,
I was chasing the warm glow of a spotlight,
City after city, state to state,
We were just three mates rocking beats and breaks,
So if you made it to a Hoods show to check the style,
You get much respect, you made it all worthwhile.

Verse Two - Pressure
Let me introduce myself, raise them beers,
Pressure MC, been doing this for more than ten years,
It's been a long road I'm glad I stayed on track,
A dream of making raps, and getting played on wax,
It seems that faking jacks want to cause my demise,
Along the way wouldn't give me play but couldn't stop the course of my rise,
Now of course the sky's the limit, we fly get with it,
You ain't underground, that's because you dig it,
It took infinite skills and hard work to get this far jerk,
Look me in the face, now I'm the one who wears a smart smirk,
It wasn't all negative, took the good with the bad,
Us falling will never happen, like catching the Hoods in drag,
In orderly fashion I'm thanking those who supported me,
Wouldn't be where I'm standing if they hadn't have fought for me,
From a nothing rep, now we live busting sets,
So if you own a Hoods album you get nuff respect.

Verse Three - Suffa
Let me introduce myself, raise them beers,
Suffa MC, been doing this for more than ten years,
We've been through a lot to perfect this art,
When Next left the group it near broke my heart,
But then Debris stepped up as the DJ,
A super team spearheaded by PJ,
Chasing dreams like Fats chasing punani,
It's all about the culture, never been about the money,
But we had to watch people trying to take advantage
Of us, trying to damn near rob us,
We got slowed down by dodgy contract offers,
But it would take a nation of millions to stop us,
We got our propers, paid our dues in triplicate,
Ripping it, till other crews were insignificant,
I've stayed true, never made myself a hypocrite,
Trust me, I'm wise I got the certificate.

Verse Four â?? Pressure
Let me introduce myself, raise them beers,
Pressure MC, been doing this for more than ten years,
Yeah we made it far, through beats pumping and flows,
My bro Rated are props for being the drunkest at shows,
And support from my mates who fought for the stakes,
Of Oz hip-hop, props to record stores, I bought from their crates,
You see talking it takes less than walking the stakes,
So put your money where your mouth is and quit flaunting as fakes,
For those who stuck by me over time I put yours over mine,
Don't have to speak your names you know my mind,
In this simple game of respect it's given as it's taken,
Been given props, now respected tracks is what I'm making,
Shouts to everyone I met on tour,
It's our hip hop ladies and gentlemen let's keep it pure,
So here's another LP from the Hoods to crank to,
Hope you dig the rest of this album people I got to thank you.

Suffa (spoken)
That's right pressure
We gotta thank everyone who's supported us and been there for us
You get much respect but for now

Verse 5 - Suffa and Pressure
Let us introduce DJ Debris
He's a cut above the rest
And that is where he'll be

Let us introduce DJ Debris
He's a cut above the rest
And that is where he'll be

DJ Debris for more than 10 years
For more than 10 years
Hilltop hoods for more than 10 years

",Testimonial Year,2005
Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Suffa
I was granted an audience in the devils maze,
I sat by his throne and we talked for days,
He told me about his ancient battles with arch-angels,
He told me loneliness was the torture most painful,
He said if I filled my lifetime with sin,
I could earn myself a seat that was right by him,
And if I didn't, that was fine by him,
'cause everyday a million souls just fly right in,
He could barely keep up with the souls of all the people,
It's not easy being sole controller of all evil,
He said â??So many people want to burn with me,
I swear free wills a bitch and so's eternity,
So what you learn from me might save you from suffering,
You don't want to see the bowels of the earth rupturing,
Take a breath, suck it in, I got more to tell,
And time's of no consequence when you're in hell.â??

Verse 2 â?? Suffa
I had a lot a questions;
I asked the devil to explain
Why I always think that people have it in for me?
And why I always feel like the sky's closing in on me?
This is what he said,
Â??The sky's not falling it's just angels committing suicide,
'cause they're so saddened by humans using genocide,
As a political tool, considering all you humans have,
The way you act belittles you all,
Now hell is so full that we started expanding,
Damnation is a business and the markets demanding.â??
I asked him if a city street buckled and cracked,
And hell rose to earth then would heaven collapse?
He smiled; I knew that smile was his response,
I thought to myself, he's almost got what he wants,
He said â??I'll tell you my one desire,
That's for earth itself to become my empire,
Every politicians like a gun for hire.
Even the church of nativity's come under fire,
So you can tell I'm getting close to my goal,
Of creating a world where I can torture every soul.â??

Chorus
Sitting with the devil, this is what I learned,
Apart from the ways a human soul can be burned,
It's that though we learn from our mistakes we're condemned,
To make those same mistakes again and again,
Sitting with the devil, this is what I learned,
Apart from the ways a human soul can be burned,
It's that though we learn from our mistakes we're condemned,
To make those same mistakes
Again and again,
Again and again,
Again and again,

again and again.

And Time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, I keep slipping away,
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, I keep slipping away,
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, I keep slipping away,
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, Like I keep -

I keep slipping away, I keep slipping away...



",An Audience with the Devil,2006
Hilltop Hoods,"Introduction â?? Trials
We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight,
And I want you to know one thing, this isâ?¦

Verse 1 â?? Suffa
Hilltop, that's where the blood runs,
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones,
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun,
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run,
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting,
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham,
So start hating, though you know in your heart,
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park.

Verse 2 â?? Mortar
You can't serve me like Serena and Venus,
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist,
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level,
And draw blood like intravenous,
Without a pencil I'm hell bent,
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when,
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme,
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines.

Verse 3 â?? Trials and Sesta
Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack,
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag,
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum,
And skull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son,
South of the country, west of the city,
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty,
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like,
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cipher,
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up,
We leave them all for dead,
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev,
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil,
And T set the theme to send them to hell,
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again,
Seddy bury every adversary he put against.

Verse 4 â?? Hau
Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach,
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat,
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes,
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying blimey he's clever,
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather,
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe.

Verse 5 â?? Drapht
None of gravities properties are on top of me,
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read,
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers,
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk,
To Conan, walking with no man now,
'cause you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth,
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this,
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Verse 6 â?? Vents
The saga begin, RPM drama again,
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen,
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again,
In camouflage targeting,
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark,
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark,
The blood run deep, renegade creep,
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat.

Verse 7 â?? Muphin and Pegz
Muph, some give me shit for my name,
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains,
Been a long while so I know the game,
It's more about music than your clothing range,
We're here to overtake, setting the standard,
Obese crew, we're the devilish family,
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy,
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties,
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit,
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit,
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits,
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets,
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary,
Crews love it when we do something visionary,
Move up never lose touch, living ready,
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy.

Verse 8 â?? Robby Balboa
Robby Balboa bless the text,
Deliver you ticket to death,
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh,
Triple your bets on the primitive pest,
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps,
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets,
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck,
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck,
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt 'cause we're kicking the set.

Verse 9 â?? Honz
The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it,
And I ain't going near your bill unless we fucking topping it,
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes,
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows,
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc,
With these pads and pens so understand my friend,
We about to take over just like Hove spit it,
To the most gifted get them glasses up and toast with us.

Verse 10 â?? Pressure
Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind,
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind,
Now I flow with the best, from east coast to the west,
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest,
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know,
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty,
Damn I got spine but you'll never see the back of me.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.



",The Blue Blooded,2006
Hilltop Hoods,"In life, we struggle as individuals
A fine line between a cliché saying and something original
As if in death we left something residual
Behind to mark our time up in this pitiful
Existence and i’m a man of many issues
If I ever dissed you, no disrespect I never wished to
Hold a grudge the stress makes me act like this
The day I get it off my chest I won’t write tracks like this
But i’ll be bitter on them when all is done and is forgotten
Cos it’s easier to sit and complain than fix the problem
But the power of speech endowers our beliefs
With sour defeats, man nothing is out of reach
Got plenty to answer for, all do is answered back
Done a thousand things I regret, apologize for none of that
So you get back what you put in no regrets
And keep on until they know your sweat, you only get

(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world, still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe in

Now if life is what you make it it’s time to build
Man I’m for real ain't no telling what this life will yield
I’m a career man, cos I career off any path
That would lead me to a start of financial gains I’m scarred
We learn from our mistakes, that makes me a scholar on
Being a walking talking fuck up and a better man for being wrong
I’m humble and loyal, my friendships are honored
A mans success ain't measured by the depths of his pocket
I give good advice but never follow it, what’s left for me
I’m a hypocrite and if I weren’t I’d be a success story
View this wide world through a narrow gaze, these harrowed days
Seen to many men end in a shallow grave
I guess it’s better to have loved and to lost, than never stumbled across
The gift of knowing you what ever the fucking cost
To put it in perspective and under my vision
This world is superficial, I’m done with others opinions

(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world, still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe out",Breathe,2006
Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Suffa
I got to jump back and kiss myself,
The Hoods have comeback to rip this girl,
Live on the drum track you dissed yourself,
So drunk that you nearly pissed yourself,
And if you come wak you risk your health,
I'm the one that made LL ring the bells,
Sharp as a thumb tack, it's the infidel,
In the back with some girl named Isabelle,
And I'm a, you're gonna what? I'm a wreck this, the freshest,
Thermoelectrics, technics and a set list,
So check this, Hilltop locks jaws like tetanus,
Fuck breakfast at Tiffanies I want Tiffany for breakfast,
The funk leader, told you last LP,
With a style that make you smile like a Chelsea,
Smile, what the fucks that man? It's when you place,
Razor blades on the cheeks then a kick to the face,
In the place and we raising the roof,
Like Al Qaeda had placed a case in the booth,
A taste of the truth and some flawless shit,
Like John Howard knows the taste of George's dick,
Man I'm born to spit these kids wish they stuck me,
I warn you kid you're bitch made like puppies,
Switch blade to Nazis' cut them through their khakis,
I lose it every time I put it down like car keys.

Verse 2 â?? Pressure
It only takes one man to bust,
But takes these two to raise them standards up,
Take three, Debris man the cuts,
This is for, those that will stand with us,
From sundown into the dawn didn't I warn?
The lyrical storm hits you in a physical form,
This isn't your norm, didn't reform, isn't your average,
Wishing to score listeners for pitiful crap it's,
Off Richter, sicker than cough fits you,
Listen to pop hits? This isn't your soft shit you,
All in the mix so start warning the kids,
They're adopted and not that they were born with a gift,
I'm so fatal that reverends won't stay till confession,
You all can't hold your own like post natal depression,
I've got a mouth of profanity, a spouse and a family,
At my house man no wonder that I'm doubting my sanity,
I'm an honest drunk, what a mentality,
Avoiding the truth is staying sober; I'm an addict of reality,
I live for tomorrow so cheating death today,
Means at all costs avoid repeating yesterday,
I'm a loose cannon, enough juice to soothe famine,
Break your back with this rap then ask you who's slamming?
Some rapper claiming a throne, unaware they,
Ain't kings only royalty they know is airplay



",Circuit Breaker,2006
Hilltop Hoods,"I’m from the city of light, with a sky of vanilla
Known as the city of churches home of the serial killer
And in the summer it feels like a hundred degrees
Where i’m from you might see suffa mc
Walking the traps trying to escape the map
Ninety one was my shit i’m trying to take it back
To when writers ran the line and transits ran the gambit
My memories the paint, let the track be my canvas
Thirteen sitting in a park, sipping wine casks
Watching whole cars as they went flying past
I couldn’t paint so I rhymed to the writers
They’d laugh, light up a smoke, and get blinded by their lighters
‘nasty arts’ ran my line evading cop cars
And we looked up to them like they were rock stars
Paint stained hands and fame like Manson
That’s Charles not Marilyn, a city held to ransom
Cans and markers, country road parkers
Hands of an artist left the landscape enchanted
Until the government pigs had all the paint washed
From our city walls, end of the renaissance
And so the walls where the colors once played
Were replaced by the buff, now a sullen blunt grey
White washed, shitty, all grey, all black
Waiting for the kids of this city to take their walls back

I’m from the city of light, with a sky of vanilla
Known as the city of churches home of the serial killer
And in the winter, the city sleeps dead in the freeze
Where i’m from you might see pressure mc
Walking the traps trying to escape the map
Ninety three was my shit i’m trying to take it back
Got kicked out of school but I would have left in time
With nothing but an ego and rap to get me by
I swept floors, packed orders, when poor racked from porters
Liquor store just to score me a four track recorder
Fifteen, sneaking in the back door to the gig
Thought I could rip, bro trust me I fought for this shit
Cos the city’s darker than a starless night
And treats a starter like a fresh piece of meat, greet the carving knife
Till the day came when i’d scar consortiums
I’d lay waiting, train stations and parks my audience
Before we had our beats made, before we had a dj
We’d rock to a beat box, before that shit was clichéd
You see mate, I refused to lay low and gave those
Better years of my life to pave roads
Live as hell, we did it by ourselves
The only secret to this shit is one that time will tell
So breathe in cos the city invites, jealously, pity and blight

First up, on the dolcet tones,
Of the Craigieburn projects,
Suffa MC came to take you home
I drip lyrics like spits, spit lyrics like drips
In the arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle web, web
'Cause what I'm hearing's all shed
On the lyrical tip
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid
We gave ya, something to jock,
But it wasn't no thing, like Bobby,
Gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring (Drinks Party)
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers as Eve
Says, keep at 'em, I'm going down on Louise
And I'm a reek havoc
Little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Titties representing the city I grew up in
We lay the path so you got a way in
It's Hilltop, the three stars at the holiday inn.

My nuts don't match the size of my ego
I seize an opportunity, cause they don't linger
That glass ain't half empty it's half full
That's why I'm a table drinker
Think your on Pressure's level?
Only think type bro, betcha at my shows dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker
Damage and suckas master fleet, huh,
If I married ya mother ya still wouldn't be half of me
You should run from me
Fuck battaling, ain't nothing sweet,
'Cause I won't beat ya to the punch I'll punch ya to the beat
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
My foots always in my mouth they just can't stomach defeat
I'm a master these until it's hard to breath

At my peak like, Marlon Brando at fifty
And I'm fat like, Marlon Brando at seventy
Fuck it, no one sick can ever better me (no one man)

And half the time half my crew could drink the bar,
And half these cats and half of what they think they are
We independent, a sign on the line
The day me giving you the finger as a sign of the times

Man the rhymes are designed to try this is but why this is
I had rewind to try to find this is man,
I just recline and mind my business,
And I'm thinkin' lines of rhymes of rhyme stitches,
Of the mind of the lines that's time for my... Ay! What the fuck!

Hilltop Hoods,"Let’s get introductions aside,
Pressure, Omni and Suffa tonight busting the mic like,
Lately I’ve been hearing nothing but hype,
Pen’s mightier than your sword? Then you’d be fucked in a fight,
From the point of the exact conception I’ve had perfection,
And you ain't close to Omni even though you may lack direction,
I've got a good heart, but bad intentions,
Pressure don’t need a map for reference I’m a man of legends,
I’ll last forever like bad impressions,
Like the first night you cursed in adolescence,
The way I slam a sentence can panic veterans,
Some things are better left unsaid like anything that I have to mention,
My loud mouths my downfall it’s doubtful,
I’ll bite off more than I can chew 'cause I already got a mouthful,
Act like I astound y'all, well I’m a scoundrel,
With enemies but cliché is a friend of me, I’m out yall.

[Chorus]
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,
It’s the universal language of relaxation.

The heart of the giant, the eye of the lion,
The smell of victory is what makes me keep trying,
My will to survive is like I’m stranded on an island,
I keep rhyming; keep climbing till somebody find me,
My city’s been behind me since the mid nineties,
Right around the time when it was cool to be grimy,
My DJ used to make the earth spin in reverse,
Put the needle to the dirt, spread the word like you heard it first,
Now it’s all twisted, somebody told the truth but they missed it,
I put it on my CD but they skipped it,
But that’s what happens when you do something different,
Some people can just stay content with the simple shit,
I live my life fast like it’s my last,
I don’t trip off of cash or dwell in the past,
I’m bigger than that I’m bigger than rap,
One of the sickest MCs on the map for bringing that back.

Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,

I heard there ain’t no party like an open bar,
We lay out rhymes like drinks for a broken heart,
Heartbreak like liquor in an open scar,
So bizarre, roll thick like smokers tar,
Tell me who can rock parties with no guitar,
And if I ain't getting paid then I’m leaving in the promoters car,
Tell me who you know this far,
Gone, on till the moments
Gone, on till the break of this governments back,
And it’s on till my mates are all loving the tracks,
No thugs in his raps, no muggings and macks,
And no guns, just trying to get us up on the map,
Bust, Suffa on wax, trust it’s on,

Born in a small town, die with a big mouth,
Hoods tore it all down, shouts to the kids south.

Hilltop Hoods,"Going down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been, we're going down
Going down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been

Growing up I needed a guide like, a blind veteran's dog,
Cause I was going nowhere like a child's letters to god,
Though life's road was hard I was never so lost,
That I looked for an answer in a medicine box,
I never did pop pills, or cop deals, just rocked hills
Kids with skills, still got harassed by the cops till,
They'd have me in the back of a paddy, down to lock up,
Smack me, pat me down for a baggy, mums would rock up,

And bail me out, a failure out once again,
Next weekend, bailed me out, drunk again,
And I never will forgive myself, for putting you through all that hell,

I went from high school dropout to factory laborer,
Slave to the clock until four, went from sleeping on the floor,
To being back on tour, now no stopping me,
I'll finish with a bang like Kurt Cobain's biography

[Chorus]
Going down the hard road, down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been, and don't know where to go its like,
Going down the hard road, down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been

I spent my youth like life was cheap,
The only change that I wanted was enough to buy a drink,
Was on a path nowhere, the harder the road,
The more broken baggage we carry the larger the load,
This school drop-out got knocked out, chased by the cops out,
Got clout, dumped by my girlfriend and locked out,
Been broke and beaten, even chocked at being,
A dope MC but never lost hope in dreaming,

We used to thrash boosted cars till the engine would fail,
If I never had bailed I'd be dead or in jail,
And man I got no one else to blame
I thank my family and music for keeping me sane,

But that's the breaks right? Started working late nights,
Never seeing daylight, getting paid like a slave might,
And I've done too many years to miss this for my missus,
To have to tell my son he nearly never existed

[Chorus]

Dj Debris c'mon and break it down like,

And I speak what I feel in the booth in the spirit of truth,
Cause all these kids that I meet man they mirror my youth,
And I could have gone the wrong way, the easy option,
But I chose to go the long way, the streets are watching,

So keep a look out, look up, B-ballers keep your hook up,
Tear a page from my book out, and pull out,
Your finger put your foot out and keep a lookout,
For what we put out, the brand new flavor for your cookout

You sound like a bitch man,
Nymphos in your clip and disco riffs man,
I'll tell you this, OK, it don't fit man,
It's like OJ, little glove, big hand,
Step to this I'll take your miss, make her twist and,
Moan, like I fucked with the pitch man,
This land where the bricks stand,
On red sands, I spit grams of powdered Difflam,
To ease your muscle pain, do the hustle,
Came to tussle against the corporate gain man,
Parcels move train to plane in the struggle,
Markers give a claim to fame in the jungle,
Street revolutionaries, we the evolutionary,
Anomalies, but stupidly they try stopping me,
That's only making me a martyr we,
Like opiates in the vein, attack the arteries,
Don't get smart with me; I got a heart in me,
Like Pharlap, and gone so far raps now a part of me,
I got camaraderie, the great unwashed,
I got a heart in me that pump's straight up scotch,
But crews still try to diss me, till I switch it on em,
Like they try to diss Fats, till they see a picture of him,
Big boys, ain't small man, they tall and,
Ugly, want to cut me come join and join the monsters ball man.

Verse 2 â?? Pressure
These are the last of days, a vast array,
Of fake fucks up in a masquerade,
It's swim or drown, we act we don't sink,
Its primal instinct we rap we don't think,
Its do or die, no turning back like suicide,
Till you're doing time with these cut throats in a suit and tie,
So don't feed the animals, or act a fool,
Your just one man, a young lamb amongst a pack of wolves,
So while you're fighting over scraps and loose change and moot claims,
Pressures higher up in the food chain,
And small time predators rove in packs,
That why big time executives throw them scraps,
So much static that this is such a hazardous business,
And having to witness that half these rappers are bitches,
Got me laughing hysterically, I've the heart of a pedigree,
So pissing on the next man is just marking my territory,
Rivals will claim over head strong beef,
And try, fighting for fame on these slept on streets,
While I'm, signing my name in the wet concrete,
Touching both sides of your brain when I flex on beats,
And when we sound the drums, I'll see cowards hung,
When my hour comes I'd rather catch a beat down than run,
It's just that honest, I don't rap for these monsters,
Id rather face the music than turn my back on you.




",Monsters Ball,2006
Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Mystro
Well I'm the one to bring the funk although my armpit's not stinking,
And I'm known to hold flows like the glass you drop drinking,
Never crude man I started of limping,
Plus I rock a fella like I know the art of parking lot pimping yeah,
You people know of Mys, the one whose flow's crazy,
And is so gravy that it should come with a bowl of rice,
The MBS with the Hilltop Hoods,
Make be-Boys and Girls break quicker than real soft wood, let's go.

Verse 2 â?? Pressure
I never hit on a girl, at least with no hand,
Girls are like serving time but time waits on no man,
Got nothing on women so I spread love on the rhythm,
And get you out your seat quicker than corrupt politicians,
And I'm on the brink, man it makes me stop and think,
I don't drink till I drop 'cause I think I might drop my drink,
Think you're more, than us? We believe in war,
Trust me your nothing I ain't seen before.

Verse 3 â?? Braintax
With one pen too high to overextend,
In dreamland with freedom starting again,
With foresight thrive on the magic of life,
And five fingers plus a mic make sick shit, Braintax,
Fuck Tony Blair like I hate George Bush,
Another seven day week, you ready for the push?
Through the eight million stories that you can't write down,
Start again from the top, come on people bounce.

Verse 4 â?? Suffa
Man all these pollies in power are cowards so it's only fair,
That I hate John Howard like I hate Tony Blair,
And I croon like Tony Bennet in a rental tux,
Experimental cuts, with the Brando Flux and Mys Diggy,
No one's as fly as these kings,
I'll leave you beside yourself like Siamese twins,
We're so deep, so nice, so full of promise,
But obese, lowlifes man what woman would want us?
We're like some hooded up bombers out storming the yard,
We're going large like a junkie out pawning his car,
This is the core of the art, and it's all from the heart,
This music put your life together when it's falling apart.

Hilltop Hoods,"Pressure (x6)
It's the next chapter, where's all my head at?
You slept at the fact that we crept back to,
Set factors straight, the only dead rappers,
Are penned at the papes of no cred actors,
Those haters, no you don't phase us,
'cause you don't know shit so, you're on a need to know basis,
And those gracious folk with no status,
I made this flow for you, no your own name is,
Not a part of the bigger picture, listen it's the,
Middle finger that you put up in a fist yeah,
Life's a bitch and it'll hit you,
If I could pimp women like I do words I'd be living a little richer,
Hip Hop's a circus act this is absurd but fact,
One critic or cynic for every that learned to rap,
One lyric with gimmick for every with purpose that,
Furthered rap culture round the earth and back,
But some diss but when I'm up in your face,
You're a man of your word; you got nothing to say,
I got respect for the scene and love for the place,
Where I bled for my dreams and struggled for change,
We're still striving on, were still alive and strong,
Right or wrong I'd still kill for where I belong,
Insightful on the real deal when I write a song,
Question, you still feel the vibe I'm on?

Verse 2 Suffa
I had the whole crowd like, oh shit, that's right I said it,
I'll be like, da, da, da, da, roll like the credits,
Two of the best to ever edit poetics,
It be the three headed beast from Obese come to set it,
Off, Hilltop in the place, sir just calm down,
Spit fire on stage and burn your bar down,
You hear it bumping in clubs you turn your car round,
You hear it pumping in pubs you buy the bar a round,
Pump it up in your car; turn your car into a club,
Smash through the wall of a pub and burn the bar down,
Just burn the bar down, like a disco inferno,
MCs aren't the only thing we burn though,
I'm the arsonist like Rakim is,
So ask your kids who the number one artist is,
Obese got the mad fucking roster while,
Your crew couldn't even house a foster child,
You're flamboyant like Oscar Wilde, I got to smile,
When you panic on stage like you lost a child,
Where's Benny? Benny's across the road watching Hilltop,
'cause they got the flow the hills have still got,
The skills, the beats to get nice on,
Don't need drugs, I get a buzz when the mics on,
So hit the floods Suffa like it with the lights on,
Hilltop, we're what's left when the vibe's gone.
",Recapturing the Vibe,2006
Hilltop Hoods,"Early morn, train station, aching from the arthritis
This war veteran knows what a hard time is
He needs his pension, dementia and half blind is
The reason he rides the train with no car license
So he boards with an expired ticket has a swipe
Gets a fine cos the change he got don't add up right
We're taking about a man who never lived a lavish life
Caught up in the age of computer chips and satellites
A lovely lady boards looking tired and half awake
He smiles, she's reminds him of his wife that past away
She says something as she walks right past his way
His old hearing aid don't last quite half the day
Some young gentlemen alive with their laughter
Approach the old timer and put a knife to his heart to
Explain that money or bloods the price of their barter
To a man whose friends probably died for their fathers

[Chorus:]
Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it?s just an observation
So take a ride we?re stopping all stations

It's been a long night the suns lifting on a cold
Morning but she's drugged and drunk tripping on her stroll
On the way home, she's done with stripping on a pole
But she can't pay for her son living on the dole
Jumps a train puts on her gloves she's wearing black
Being watched by some old mug she's glaring back
She's on edge and got the bug from sharing smack
So she says, Hey, what the fuck you staring at??
He smiles, an unsteady hand rubs on his dome
She takes a seat, a messy band of ruffs board alone
To the digger with a machete at his lungs and he's prone
He can barely stand but ready to stand up for his own
She tries to help him she doesn't choose to flee the car
And catches a blow with enough bruise to leave a scar
She starts fainting, the rooms moving and seeing stars
Ain't it amazing how courageous human beings are?

[Chorus:]

He knows nothing but toil, strife and hard yakka
Pissed at the world for playing wife in a slammer
This man was never given a life on a damn platter
So he jumps a train with knife and bandanna
Boys at his back, sleazy, hardened and far
From giving a fuck, an easy target his mark
He sees an old man and says ""See we'll part with your hard
Earned cash or rest in peace we can start with your heart""
Some girl steps not afraid she's gonna cop it sweet
And gets decked before she made it even on her feet
The old man leaped to her aid and to his horror he'd
Thrusted his chest into the blade of his robbers piece
He grabbed the wallet, dropped the knife as he fled the car
Concerned about the loss of life he'd never went this far
What's done is done, he'd got the prize and he'd spent his half
Of two dollars in change and a pension card

This ain't living, listen it’s dying slowly

Got our own sneaker, feel free to walk a mile in my shoes,

And it's so beautiful it's painful, a sweet sickness,
Like picturing the rest of your life with a girl you've known,
For three minutes, and proposing in a day and a half,
What we're composing here's state of the art,
It weighs heavy on your brow like a crown of thorns,
And that's when we break it down man sound the horns,
Now reborn, work hard, eat lunch in the car,
But we play hard, Braveheart drunk in a bar,
We're here so take heart, we're making music that's honest,
The movements upon us like some rebels moving through in the forest,
Carrying a torch to burn Babylon,
For every musician a label ever put a saddle on

Chorus:
What we're doing here is crazy,
Super Official with the style,
What we're doing here is crazy,
If you ain't up on this, then you ain't up on shit,
Super Official with the style,
If you ain't up on this, then you ain't up on shit

Hilltop Hoods,"I'm wondering where the day went
The clouds have me shrouded in grey but
I'm still out pounding the pavement, word
Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper
Founded a label now I'm drowning paperwork
But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work
And I love it 'cause that what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescued
So forget what the rest do
I'm blessed to do it with two of who are the best to do it
Do I love it?

Look at our goals
If we never stood in the cold we wouldn't evolve
Used to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve
But took control now, hard work is good for my soul
And I love it, growing through life and stress
Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness
Contract owners and licenses, showbiz in lights we're just
Searching for that moment of pricelessness

B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

Five days deep in the booth, and spent Friday leaping through loops
Then spent the weekend sideways, seeking the truth
And I won't lie they keep me on my toes these days
But I won't lie, hey I beat 'em with the flow for days
'Cause I love it, a pen and pads like a red rag to a bull
I see red like Leningrad
Raising a crowd from a vacant lot's like, like how
Raising a brow on the face of god right? Right now

And I love it a life with no regret
No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in a crisis I might just know the ledge
But I love it like take away beer
And a sunset to lay away our day-to-day fears
See haters under rates us but this status takes years
And it ain't where we're at; it's how we made our way here

B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

And we can be in a hotel, worst part of town and
Support act, we ain't half as loud but
Twice as nice you can ask the crowd then
We passing out in a departure lounge and
I love it, I hug the road like an old friend
Like the world won't revolve unless we're rolling on it
It holds them on it, it's soul melodic
And oh they want it and I love it

Been chasing the dream
Everyday a new place, new faces and scene
Living out a suitcase few breaks in between
There's been very few days I'd loose faith in my team
Got love far from home through the winter and summer
No matter how hard the road or the distance I cover
Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other
I wouldn't trade it for the world given another
'Cause I love it

Hilltop Hoods,"I lay down my music ten feet from where I lay down
Immersed in them beats, short breaks turned to breakdowns
'Cause when you work where you sleep, you don't sleep
'Cause you work on them beats till it hurts then you creep
Into bed and wake her from her sleep, and she's hurt
'Cause she worked through the week 
And hasn't heard not a word nor a peep
From the jerk that she keeps in her heart
That she forgives when he nurse her to sleep, word it's deep
But yo, when I peel them lids back and emerge from my sleep
I feel so big that I could make a shirt from my sheet
A crown from a church steeple, two Jeeps for my sneaks
So people worship this creep as I surf down the street
I'm the surgeon of beats, your girl purrs when I speak
We rehearse in a church to a circus of freaks
We the last ones to lay down, first on our feet
So stay down or get hurt by what lurks in the deep
Free the perps from the police, we disturbing the peace
We flood the streets like a water main burst and released
A merciless beast with a thirst for the feast
Man we treat every meal like it's our first in a week
We dispersing the weak, I'm the person to beat
Man I'm unbeatable, I can beat a person for weeks
We disturbed, we the freaks, we the ones you don't listen to
Drinking from the sun, now son we're the ones dissing you

And we don't (ever stop), we won't (let it drop)
We don't (ever stop), and we won't 
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don't (ever stop), and we won't (let it drop)
We move mountains and drink from the sun

We're timeless like riders on the storm
Survivors like the light that rises in the dawn
If crisis makes fighters of the pawns
We rise up through the night as lifeless and we're born
Fight in my heart, suicide with my art
'Till I depart I'ma write until I light up the dark
These are battle songs that lift you from your catatonic fixture
And I can walk on water but I stagger on the liquor
This ain't a Saturday sport or matinee talk
With throwaway sentences like the magistrates' court
Scratch that, now hear me out, attacks don't give me doubt
I drop a powerhouse track black the city out
And when we lose it let the mood of music reach us
Coming through the tunes that free us
Revolution through your speakers
The third rock never stops, the world turns
Eyes glued to the clock as we watch the world burn

And we don't (ever stop), we won't (let it drop)
We don't (ever stop), and we won't 
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don't (ever stop), and we won't (let it drop)
We move mountains and drink from the sun

Renegades whenever on center stage
That's my sweat upon the letters I bled on the pen and page
C'mon, so what's your rhyming worth? 
Better get a lawyer 'cause
I could crucify your verse just to get a point across
We've been refining and grinding till late night
Why, 'cause even stars lose their shine in the daylight
Linked as one, just think what we'll become
It's begun and won't stop till we're drinking from the sun",Drinking from the Sun,2012

Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good

Where Hip Hop is like a convict on a standing trial
Dropping havoc I’ll rock the planet wild
'Till they shoot me in a movie Hong Kong combatant style
Plastic rapping and disposable culture
Poet or solider, falter and get thrown to the vultures
We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder
Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar
Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola
Keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta
Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller
Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur
You in a house made of glass throwing a boulder
But never see the light of day car like car motors on solar

Play the martyr role better than Mohammed Atta

Beat you single-handed like Def Leppard’s drummer

The key to freedoms said to be, release and leave the memory
Think you offended me? Please, with critics like these who needs an enemy?
Indeed a breed of pedigree beast unleashing speech telepathy
Here to bleed the industry of its diseased and evil effigy
Demons, thieving, greed and revelry, we're in need and seeking remedy
But it seems to stay ten feet ahead of me like a centipede
I'm a train upon a track, I'm a flame upon a match
Ain't straying from my place I want my face upon the map
I'm the weight upon your back, I'm a razor on your lap
We came to conquer, stage and opera, fade it onto black
Now hush, hear the voice, so addicted to the
Rush to fill the void, missing everything we

Jump up, but you're stunned, dumb struck, you're done like Young Buck post Fifty
We claw at the morons, and pour on the soothing hooks on heaters
Like them pouring the Boron on core on the shore of Fukushima
They adore the recordings and we lording it over them
Think we're joking? Then we're going door to door with some Dobermans
No DMX, they thinking they got me pegged like BMX

Hilltop Hoods,"Another war another martyr revered
Passed the fear from their fathers then it’s lasting for years
Bullets don’t discriminate the skin color they pierce
We speak the same language brother love, laughter and tears
Refugees trading death for a prison
While some base a set of opinions on race, sex or religion
Come on, enough day to day stress of just living
Without giving a fuck if they’re hated just cause you’re different
Let’s do it under the name of the love that became lost
Dress it up how you want, we’re cut from the same cloth
Scars of hate, frowns stitched to our faces
Can’t escape the cage we forge, we’ve got bars to break
For those living every bit of the struggle
Given to hustle trying to figure how they fit in the puzzle
Cause right now we’re in pieces and peace is the people as one
Till then we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

Can make an eight-year soldier fall asleep with a gun
While tax mans hands deep in your funds, raping your ones
Money tight like we tweaking the drums it’s like we speaking in tongues
But no book burnings or church sermons
I surf currents, my words burn like a dirt furnace
Confusion leads and anguish sells
But this music succeeds where even language fails
To convey free honest expression
It’s a problem trying to get people to acknowledge progression
My goal is to leave a lasting iconic impression
Controlling crowds like demonic possession and ain’t no time to invest in
Biting the hand that created the platform
Attaching pseudo patriotic crap to a rap song

I would never
Hate someone for the way they display love for someone else
(And if you do)
The blame comes from the weight of the way that you see yourself
Take some of the weight off your plate by taking the hate away
And then maybe you’ll make your way to start loving yourself
Fear’s a cancer logic is a countermeasure
A property that you can’t count or measure
I got a problem with people who got a problem with
The way that other people wanna live, that’s their prerogative
They’re mad at how you love, where your prayers are going
Their anger’s like a drug, they’re mad at where you from
But fuck a redneck checking if your visa’s valid
They act like pigs and chickens I’m sick of Caesar salad
So we seize the mallet, and we swing on the ignorant
Can’t speak our language? Then we’ll see if you can sing in it

Hilltop Hoods,"They say you can't love and be wise, but I can pretend
With you, if suddenly I ever have to surrender you
I'd fall in a heap, I'd fall on the floor
And crawl on all fours, for you I'd fall on my sword
If grief ever darkened my door, you'd light it up
The way you brighten up a room hits me right in the chest
It puts the breath inside of my lungs
It's like I lept in the light of the sun
And in spite of my weary frown
You wear a smile that wears me down
So hear me out, I know that I wasted time
When I should've been replacing your last name with mine
And that mistake is mine, believe me
I wear it like a sunburn, it might disappear but it won't leave me
I'll carry you on my shoulders, never set you down
Ferry you through the coldness, never let you down

I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

Travelling man in the back of a van
Capturing sands like time through the back of my hand
If I could hold her for a moment, do a lap of this land
I'd console you for a moment, then be back in a glance
But I'm so far since we left for the road
Chicks I've seen around the heavens and globe
Searching for the next episode
Problem is, in letting it go
Be like letting go of everything you treasure and know
And whenever I go, I think my chest will explode
No matter where your heart at, brain leaves death in the crew
Try and understand, where I lay my head is my home
And I was in love, before this rap shit was ever in vogue
But if you feel that you're ever alone
While standing in the same room as me
Let's set it in stone
You can't save me, acquainted to this devilish road
But you're bravely willing to give a hell of a go
So

I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

I hate that I was wasted your touch, your taste
My shame, can't change, want you to remain
My angel, my heartbeat, come closer, I'm sorry
My soul is, yours truly, you know this

And you know that I
Won't be shy, talking bout what you're giving me
Conflict diamond, you shine through the misery
You walk in a room and light it up, that's just with your entry
You walk in a room and light it up, like it was four twenty
Some people never find out what they have
Only ever find out what they had
And I could've been one of them, don't know if I still won't
And that thought hangs around my neck like a millstone
For real though, it's like I lost you, left you, let you go
Before I got to get you, or let you know
That you're my refuge and I need you to see
The only one I let down more than you is me

And I won't let you down, and I won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

She said there's one thing I forgot to tell you, 
Yeah there's one thing you should know. 

She said my mamma was a voodoo princess 
And my heart beats black like coal, 
Well she made up some black magic gumbo and some voodoo etoufe'
She said once you taste my cookin boy 
It's gonna steal your heart away, 
She said there's one more thing I forgot to tell you

Yeah there's one thing that you should know, 
She said once you taste my baby's cookin', 
It's gonna turn your heart black like coal. 
Now she took me on a little walk down the bayou, 
On a lovers rendezvous. 

She said take my hand little Cajun man 
Gonna do the thing lovers do, 
Now there's one thing I forgot to tell you, 
Yeah there's one thing you should know, 
She said oh-oh-oh-oh oh

Now this ain't hardly no story, 
Yeah it's barely even worth the tell, 
But you ramble around in a delta town, 
You're sure to lose yourself, 
And there's one thing I forgot to tell you, 
Yeah there's one thing I forgot to tell you. 
I said now don't you go messin' with no voodoo mamma, 
She'll take you straight to hell.",Louisiana Song,2001

We were more than sweethearts,

White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw
Children by the dozen in and out the bamboo hut 
One for every palm tree and coconut  
Hurry up now
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne

Himsa,"Flawless, so red raw, and real, 
The beast of the street, 
Speaks faceless to me. 

Fierce, the deepest of depths, 
Sends daggers and fire, 
From each shearing end. 

Summons, outcry for battle, 
Living illusion, 
Straight to the heart. 

I enter, sanctuary, 
They bury, the dead. 

Makes way, for the pain and promise, 
Dawning devotion, 
Numbing all in dismay - Stands alone. 

Lash out, strength in submission, 
Giving to exploits, 
A swift sudden death. 

Swarming, hybrids of exile, 
Outlaws in anthem, 
Sketched even in script. 

Screams clean, 
Sincerity - To break the crisis, 
Of a vacant past. 


(Words of wisdom, Words as weapons) 

Destroyer - Your course remains unscathed. 
Destroyer - Your course is unscathed. 

I enter sanctuary, 
They bury the dead. 

As the abyss - Is filled and forgotten. 

Conviction, The sign of its times, 
Translates the quarrel, 
With no objection. 

And issued, Sarcasm and war, 
To this distant boy, 
With more desperate needs. 

My commune, 
Safe haven, 
Secures my temperament, 
And in retrospect, I prevailed, 
With the ones who saved my life.

Changelings never stop changing

Addiction is cunning so bite the hand that feeds

The want is calling mutinying imagery
There is no answer to the living dead
Possessing privilege from law laid down

The rumors to whispers
That makes a crass man bound

Defy
Their break in mercy
To consume the myth through flawlessness

It's been discovered
What they've exposed
Harbors the failures
To what we own
And they comply
To justify
Those shifting winds of conformity

A razor to writs slit recovery
The struggle to botch
Impulsive structure from a slow-handed conspiracy

Empowered but uncovered

The tension to tame the iconoclast

And reverse their sands in the hourglass

Bury the hatchet in the name of progression

Stripped and severed
While kindred thoughts build unbearable

Rapture for the fallen
A piece of them is a part of me
But their voices are left unheard

They never scream
They never starve
They never bleed
They never suffer
And they will never ever understand

Deceive
Those jubilant whores
With the delicate sense in delivery

Deceive
The crashing bores
Who've left us hung out to dry and die

Part the seas
And pave your way
To the sirens of new noise
Let the lace be the bait
As the past as the past portrays
While you leave the enemy entertained

We'll always scream
We'll always starve
Seminal
Always bleed
Always suffer
We are the sentiment
For we were raised in the shadows

She's the holy ghost, lost without a trace
And now we're left with the ""what-ifs""
It's been five years since she left for LA
She's an angel with a dirty face
And it seems to me she's a casualty of all the pressure
That we put on her, and now we've lost her for good

Was a lot like you and a lot like me
And she never walked on water

She was so adored by everyone
When it came to looks, she was next to none
But loved partying and having too much fun
Then she hooked up with the wrong someone
And he promised everything under the sun
And it seems to me she's a casualty of all the pressure

When you wouldn't even look at me

Here's one last kiss goodbye

No more alibis, no more inner lies
You've broken my trust and it can't be fixed
I should've seen the signs
Should've recognized the way your lips looked like they've been kissed
How did we end up like this?

I only call home if I get the chance

Wake up, just in time to miss the day
And I'm talking to the man in the mirror
And I think I heard him say

Whatcha gonna do
When the whiskey ain't working no more
And life don't feel like before
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
When the ride ain't coming no more
Nobody's beatin' down your door
Whatcha gonna do

I've been down too low
Down in the streets
But I'm high enough to make believe
That I ain't ever gonna hit the ground
The one that got away from me
Every now and then she calls to see
If I'm alive or plan to settle down
Well I called her drunk last night
And I think I heard her say

Whatcha gonna do
When the whiskey ain't working no more
And life don't feel like before
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
When the ride ain't coming no more
Nobody's beatin' down your door
Whatcha gonna do

Because the voices in my head are getting louder
Getting louder every night

Call me a dreamer

Call I call it mine

Heaven, but I don't care

And call me crazy

Cause I'm homesick for it

Yet I have never been there

Call me a stranger

Cause that's all I am, I know I don't belong

Call me anything but when He calls me

Call me gone


(chorus)

Call me gone, I'll be leavin

Call me gone, you'll be greavin

If you're left here without Jesus to call on

Call me gone, no more heartache

Call me gone, and all that it takes

As for me to hear Him call me then call me gone


(This verse is to be spoken)

You know I've been called an awful lot of things in my lifetime

And to be honest smart wasn't always one of them

But thank God I was smart enough one day to call Jesus Christ the Lord of my life

And it was then I called it quits to a whole lot of sinnin

But it's because of that commitment that a lot of people laugh at me and call me foolish

Aw.. but let em go ahead and laugh...

That don't bother me at all, cause any fool can see,

but the shape she's in that this ole worlds gonna fall,

But just as long as I know Jesus, I've got nothing to fear

And when the role is called up yonder,

Don't you call on me cause I ain't gonna be here!

Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus]

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, yeah
""Look at the way he treats me"" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls 
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

[Chorus: x2]",Ms. Jackson,2002

Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear

Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes

Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty
But now it's gettin' ugly

Though I am country
Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin' legend
And this is gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here

Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight
Know he was smilin'

Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean

Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet
Smoke a lot of kush & I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' gotta buss a cape
I'mma take a phone call, hustle everyday

Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from New Mexico and let me work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Beat that pussy up like *Emmett Till*
Yeah
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho, callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch ""leave me the fuck alone!""
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate!

We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges

Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

How can I explain what I'm going through?

Brothers in the basement ’til he's thirty
Wolf child’s heavy with the weight of the world
Storing all his love in an adolescent girl

All I ever heard was ""it wasn't my fault""
But what good is truth if you don't understand
Nothing but a pair of calloused hands?

And there's no decision

There were splinters from her thoughts
Unless you knew a god
With kindness in her heart

With a knack for pushing boys off a cliff
And the messy eyes of ink-splattered fits
And it's all found in a page

Where the sky falls down with the cumulus cries
A winter song for a January type

I could blind my eyes
The river is an organ
And the meadow is a church
For a strange inclination
That fortune is a curse
I'm a cryptic writer
I'm an ignorant fool
I'm a poor excuse for poetry
Trying to play it cool
I'm just trying to play it cool

Just let me know when you've found them
You've got tact and I've got bravado

Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory

Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny

On the balcony, hands on railing
Asking, asking me where's the fire
Feel the wind in my face
Some things never leave you

Oh, I've been waiting for so long
I've been walking on hot stone
Oh, I've been moving on slow train
I've been walking on stone
I've been thinking about setting the world on fire

Seven in the morning, tinder all my money
On the great western road
Feel the wind in my face, take a look in my eyes

There is dust in their hearts
They turn they burn and bring me down
There is dust in their hearts

Cool blue notes echo this land loud
The jewels in my heart
Strike a chord and break my spine
There is dust in their hearts

I saw your face
In a long white car
Move away from here
Get away from here

Gates of the wild kingdom
Open up to me
I stood around in a cloud of doubt
Is this where I should be

White wheels in the city tonight
There is dust in their hearts
They turn they burn and bring me down
There is dust in their hearts

I saw your face
In a long white car
Move away from here
Get away from here

How much longer can I live this way
I've been in the storm so long

Take me back to where I belong

In a long white car
Move away from here
Get away from here

Pass through the heat
Catch a thief, a honeythief

Let me see what I don't get
The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get

That's the price you pay
When love gets in the way
Stealth in the night
I come to steal with stealth

I don't want to know the lover at my door

So when you tell me that you love me no for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
What if it was paradise, what if we were symphonies
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you

Than what I feel for you

No heart so true

Hiroe Sekine,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Hiroko Baba,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it

Hirshfield,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1988

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

And how to whack a cricket ball;

We are the products of those homes serene and stately

How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;

And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.

Where the oak and black jack trees
Kiss the playful Prairie breeze

Hit Boy,"I met this bitch in LA shopping on Melrose
She had designer clothes on and some French tip toes
She was slim up in the waist and drove a pink Mustang
But all she wanted me to do was buy her weed all day
I met this bitch in NY she was oh so fly
Front row at fashion week was her favorite pastime
All she talked about was dressin Express and her favorite lines
But little did I know she had a million other guys
Then this bitch out in the A with a big ol ghetto booty
Always wanted to do me
Kept it wet like a jacuzzi
Had to switch to her hips, carried herself like a lady
Then the homies finally told me she a stripper and she crazy
Now It's LA, NY, Atlanta kind of bitches
That love stripping and clubbing, and tanning kind of bitches
It don't matter where they from or if they shape is different
They all got a quality that just comes up missing

That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
No matter how bad she is, it's a bad ending

That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches

That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
No matter how bad she is, it's a bad ending

(Can't trust you)
Can't trust a big butt and a smile
But fuck it write your number down

Met this bitch in the IE used to work at the mills
Part time, went to college, Cal State in the hills
Bitch would claim she always studying so we would just be texting
Til I seen her in the club sipping drink in Game section
Met this bitch in DC on paper she travel weekly
Always listen to Lauryn Hill and Dilla on the CD
Said she don't know nobody and that she just a fan
Then I seen her backstage with the credentials I had
I met this bitch out in Miami crazy body she be tannin
She party with the best of em and drink what she was handed
And you know how it go I thought she was the best
Til I seen her court side three seats to the left
It go IE, DC, Miami kind of bitches
That watch Love and Hip Hop and Ballin kind of bitches
It don't matter where they from or if they shape is different
They all got a quality that just comes up missing

That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches

Ghost
Did lot

Stone cold shooter, let the heater blow
Gun that a just main Twitter, follow the leader though
Up in the hood, homie askin, I got my Nina on
Just stood his eyes on some niggas that he needed gone
It’s like that recorder, life ain’t normal
If you die to shine then ice ain’t for you
If the sky fall then the sky can’t warn you
When your head crack the base don’t warn you
Lightin up weed, pour that sour
In the streets in the mix like Kool Aid powder
Ride on them niggas, show em you ain’t coward
Yea you got family but you ain’t ours
Get popped up, oxed up, or boxed up
Think it’s a joke then bitch nigga done up up
Cuz I’m ghost and I’m still OG
This time I’m with Statik and it’s real OG, wuddup?

Livin rich or livin poor
Funerals stay on schedule
This not season, can’t stop the heatin
Funerals stay on schedule
All the G’s is getting money and relaxin
But funerals stay on schedule
And I don’t even care about the charges, invade federal
Funerals stay on schedule

I walk the cold streets of the city with big heaters
Ready for cats, there’s no one up, they dick beat us
Yea it’s Big B, the trill OG walkin
So keep yo mouth shut when the OG talkin
If I want your opinion then nigga I’ll beat it out of you
I’m real for the gunners bitch, I do on what I gotta do
And that’s got a lot to do with where I was raised
Reach and old man in the trill where they roamin with K’s
Always round with the gauge and they lurkin with meaners
Who will serve to get paid, committing more than misdemeanors
Once the while the shit you see my nigga do in his life
The average shit, there’s no one on here every night
You can go to PA, til they beam all the yonkers
The young niggas wilin in the streets, going bonkers
Best thing I could do right now is pray for you
Just to narrow that pistol nigga to lay on you, hold up

For every nigga that say he proud of me
It’s a nigga that’s out for me
Feelin like Martin Luther, I’m standin out on the balcony
Niggas used to be tough but I cut em off, call em equities
Niggas was in the fam with me, only niggas that dance with me
Bitches ain’t wanna fuck, now they on and this for a chance with me
If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin rhapsody
Feel like I’m a rhapsody, killin it with my faculty
High up above the ground, I swear I’m defying gravity
Yea I be younger but when I grow up I’mma buy me something
I always knew I’m like the psyche bluffin
Miss clear where the hustle, watch where I could see the future
We got bigger guns than dreams, little niggas will shoot ya
For no reason other than colors, he looked up to his brother
Now we layin beside him, too many tears for a mother
Too many story of hunger but fuck ya
If I must so I be out here in the streets tryna teach my niggas to come up, word

Copy kicks and shit, high heels
Eternal hoes, say you loved you so much
I had to judge the falls
Tryin'a understand your position
Wish I had a prescription
Finally see that sad is a sickness
In that black 5 50 in the cut
Listenin' to that nigga' who used to be signed to puff
You know I wish I never met her, at all
I ain't usher, I ain't waiting on that car

And I'll be ok boo, cause soon I?ll be a lit more stable
And I'll be ok too

Think about the ways we fucked
Reminiscing all that trust

Really get it how I live, like this ain't what you used to
Somebody finna open up the door

A shorty says she wanna take a trip, got a pool take a dip
Like this ain't what you used to
Nah, this ain't what you used to
Nah, this ain't what you used to

Racquetball without those gems, magic gets made when the lights get dim
And shorty ass fat but her waist real slim, might get a Evo or a X5M
Roll with the winners where the winters ain't cold
We chasing all the heat while we traveling the globe
Waking up to breakfast, got the Gucci on the robe
Been diamonds in the bezel like they cutting on the store
What you wanna do, you and your crew
You're coming through, come spend the night
You living right, might change your life
Money ain't a thing, I could clearly pay the price
And all real legends do the same thing twice
Got a DC ' bitch that loves to use the word slice
And every time I hit it then she wearing nigga ice
She said that we bad but I ain't taking her advice

Talk about a come up cause the youngin' been about it
I could tell you 'bout the hustle cause I always been around it
Into every situation tried to get some ends about it
At 17 my bitch was 35, I had a vet
It's how I'm living and that boy ain't even made a check
They ask me how much would I put up on the placing bets
I would bet everything, I knew I'll always be a king
Shorty fell in love, it was just a fling
She be in the lab, show a nigga sing
Home girl hating on her, she might intervene
Back of my mind I'm just hoping that they do the team
Young niggas winning on this side, so in love but you'll never dig right

I say these hating ass niggas can't ruffle my fathers
Or touch on my leathers
Success is my mental, looking at all my endeavors
She poppin' it steady, I swear that I'm ready
To lock it down, give her life like she Martin and Eddy
They yelling young and the realest cause I show cold game
Tsunami all on these bitches, you niggas just make it rain
I'm taking trips to Japan, everything's stitched by the hand
My whole team on fire, nigga, NBA jam

My only prayer, is that you realize.
You'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.

You will always be, beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show,
that you will always grow,
evermore beautiful, in my eyes.

And there are lines upon my face,
from a lifetime of smiles.
But when the time comes to embrace.

We won't say goodbye, 'cause true-love never dies.

It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say

Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

Just a little bit of, just a little bit of,
Just a little bit of, just a little bit of

I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, trying to show faces
I'm waiting for the right time to shoot my steez you know
Waiting for the right time to flash them ki's, then 
I'm leaving, please believing, oh!
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I feeding
No deceiving, nothing up my sleeve and
No teasing I need you to
Get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he asking for
'Cause I feel like busting loose
And I feel like touching you, uh uh
And can't nobody stop the juice
So baby tell me what's the use? I said

It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Uh, uh, uh, let it hang all out!

Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles? c'mon
What good is all the fame if you ain't fucking the models
I see you driving, sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and ""Park""ed it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend
Like ""Girl I think my butt getting big!""

Let it hang all out
Mix a little bit of
With a little bit of 
Let it just fall out
Give a little bit of
With a little bit of

With a little bit of 
And a sprinkle of that 
Let it just fall out
I like it when ya 
Girl, baby make it

Stop pacing, time wasting
I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement what?
I'm just kidding like Jason oh
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra, eh, spread the news check it
Nelly took a trip from the Luna to Neptunes
Came back with something thick and it fitting in sasoons
Say she got a thing about cutting in restrooms, oh

Let it hang all out
Mix a little bit of 
With a little bit of 
Let it just fall out
Give a little bit of
