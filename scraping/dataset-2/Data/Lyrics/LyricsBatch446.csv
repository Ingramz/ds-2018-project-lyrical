Andreas Vollenweider,"Let's Go To Tahiti 
Let's go to Tahiti
Let's go to Tahiti

Well, the man been working in the shop all year
He said ""Men, we've got to get out of here""
Well, the girl been working in the five-and-dime
She says, ""Girls, let's go while we've still got the time""

Let's go to Tahiti
Let's go to Tahiti

Tell the captain 'Put the rum on the boat'
Everybody on board, let's see if she'll float
Let that old jet plane fly on by
We've got the time till the day we die

Let's go to Tahiti
Let's go to Tahiti

Let's Go To Tahiti",Passage to Promise,1995
Andreas Vollenweider,"Let me be before the world
What I am when I'm alone
And when my vision falls below
Let there be forgiveness

Let me answer when I'm called
Let me know the voice is right
And when it's deep inside my soul
I'll know it by it's light

And when it's deep inside my soul
I'll know it by it's light
Help me to make the loving choice

Let me answer when I'm called
By the mighty and the small
In the service of my soul
Let there always be forgiveness
Forgive",Forgive,2006
Andreas Vollenweider,"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Oh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing",Midnight Clear,2006
Andreas Willers,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",L' Aurà,1990
Andreas Zaron,"Like the sand can seep right through your fingers so can all your day
As those days go by you'll have me there to help you find the way.
The way I feel with you I know it's got to last forever.
And when the rain begins to fall
you'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
you'll never have to ask me why.
And when the rain begins to fall I'll be the sunshine in your life

You know that we can have it all and everything will be allright.
Time goes by so fast
You've got to have a dream
To just hold on.
All my dreams of love began
With the reality of you
You and I believe
That all our dreams will last forever
And when the rain begins to fall

Though the sun may hide
We still can see
The light that shines for you and me

We'll be together all that we can be
And when the rain begins to fall

And when the rain begins to fall",When the rain begins to fall,
Andrée Watters,"Tous mes vœux de bonheur
Pour toi et ta nouvelle fleur
Embrasse tes parents
Dis ""Bonjour"" à ta sœur
Tu es déjà guéri
Toi qui avais besoin de temps
Tu t'es bien vite remis
De tous tes ressentiments

Tu sais que je ne m'avouerai jamais jalouse
Mais je me demande encore ce que tu lui trouves.
Dis-moi ce qui t'a mené vers elle
Ce qu'elle a de si exceptionnel
Dis-moi pourquoi tu m'as remplacée
Où est passée ma place à tes côtés

Je me souviens des matins
Où on était simplement bien.
A laisser passer
Les heures qu'on ne voulait plus compter.
Je me souviens des soirs
Où l'on passait nos nuits à boire.
A se raconter
Nos déchirures et nos victoires.

Tu sais que je ne m'avouerai jamais jalouse
Mais je me demande encore ce que tu lui trouves.
Dis-moi ce qui t'a mené vers elle
Ce qu'elle a de si exceptionnel
Dis-moi pourquoi tu m'as remplacée
Où est passée ma place à tes côtés

Qu'est ce qu'il y a dans ces mots que je n't'ai jamais dit?
Qu'est ce qu'il y a dans ces yeux?
Qu'est ce qu'il y a de si beau?

Dis-moi ce qui t'a mené vers elle
Ce qu'elle a de si exceptionnel
Dis-moi pourquoi tu m'as remplacée
Où est passée ma place à tes côtés

Dis-moi ce qui t'a mené vers elle
Ce qu'elle a de si exceptionnel
Dis-moi pourquoi tu m'as remplacée
Où est donc passée ma place à tes côtés

Dis-moi ce qui t'a mené vers elle
Ce qu'elle a de si exceptionnel
Dis-moi pourquoi tu m'as remplacée
Où est passée ma place à tes côtés",Si exceptionnel,2011
Andrée Watters,"He was a fast machine
He kept his motor clean
He was the best damn man I had ever seen
He had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs

Taking more than he share
Had me fightin' for air
He told me to come but I was already there
'Cause the walls were shakin'
The earth was quakin'
My mind was achin'
And we were makin' it and you

Shook me all night long
C'mon girlfriend
Oh yeah
Shook me
Said you shook me all night long
Oooh shook me

Workin' double time
On the seduction line
He was one of a kind, he's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
He made a meal out of me and came back for more

Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
Now the walls were shakin'
The earth was quakin'
My mind was achin'
And we were makin' it and you

Shook me all night long
C'mon girlfriend, shook me
Ooooooooh you

And I'm just a boy
Sometimes things happenin'
We don't have a choice
Some call it faith
Some call it an accident
I call it beautiful, like heaven sent

Last night my whole life
Came to a change
'Cause last night I left my
Heart back at a place

Where I'm willing to take you girl
I will feel every inch of your skin
And you know I can rock your world

Imma be the calm in the storm you're looking for

Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
I'll spend my life trying to figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
And let me kiss you inside out.

I don't care if you steal all my air
We can breath in together as one
It's all right if you're here every night
Waking up with you in the sun

We start with an hour and we find we waste the day
Kicking back with the love we found.

Andrei Kitaev Trio,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Andrei Kondakov,"There are some folks I used to know
Who used to smile and say hello
And spin the world and turn the page

Entertaining from the stage
But father time forever true
Loves its own and me and you
And disappear just like the sun
When the day is done

The world is falling down, hold my hand
It's a lonely sound, hold my hand
We'll follow the breeze and go like the wind
And look for a place where the willows bend
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Summer's gone and winter's here
We had a lot of rain this year
The news is really very sad
The time is late, the fruit is bad
The morning's come and roosters crow
But people have nowhere to go
And disappear just like the sun
When the day is done

The world is falling down, hold my hand
It's a lonely sound, hold my hand
We'll follow the sun and live for the day
And look for a place where the children play
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Oh, the world is falling down, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand",Aniuta,2007
Andreja Malir,"Shining water, silent daughter, face turn from the sun
Guiding light through silver night, your songs blend into one
Crystal morning dew is forming, falling through the trees
Deep inside your simple guidance whispers on the breeze

Danú, danú, danú, danú Dé
Danú, danú, danú, danú Dé

Radiant fire on distant mountains, guide your voice to me
Patterns of eternal light that set my spirit free
Dreams of ancient silent forests, visions of the past
Fill my thoughts, caress my mind and call for me at last

Danú, danú, danú, danú Dé
Danú, danú, danú, danú Dé

Silent daughter, shining waters, turn against the sun
Golden flight from silver night, the songs blend into one
As the evening mists are forming, falling through the trees
Fill my thoughts, caress my mind, I hear you call to me

Danú, danú, danú, danú Dé",Shining Water,2005
Andreja Malir,"Gentle breeze, scattered embers on moonlit water
Waking the cool breath of night
Silent stars shining down from eternal darkness
Frozen reflections of light

And for one moment in time
I hear a whisper of paradise
And for one moment in time
I hear a whisper of paradise

Golden sun rising out of a pale blue morning
Carries the summer along
Distant cries, seagulls dance in unending patterns
Echoes rejoice with their song

And for one moment in time
I hear a whisper of paradise
And for one moment in time
I hear a whisper of paradise",Whispers of Paradise,2005

Andrés Calamaro,"Catalina tenía la rutina 
Del eterno crepúsculo en la piel 
Su comarca de sexo en una esquina 
Sus hectáreas de pecho en un vaivén 
Catalina sabía el argumento 
De la sábana rota por amor 

Me soplaba la letra con su aliento 
Y nos iba surgiendo esta canción 
Labio sobre labio, sobre labio 
Y la península mía 
Beso contra beso, contra beso 
Y tu bahía 
Cuando se hacen las dos de la mañana 
Cuando se hacen las cuatro del amor 
Sus pupilas se hamacan porcelana 
En ojeras de rímel y carbón 
Catalina de fuego y nicotina 
Esperando volver a comenzar 

Bocanada profunda que ilumina 
La mirada marrón de par en par 
Labio sobre labio, sobre labio 
Y la península mía 
Beso contra beso, contra beso 
Y tu bahía 

La mirada en el techo de los días 
La ceniza en el suelo del pudor 
Y su nombre arrugado en una silla 
Su apellido tendido del balcón 
Encendé la fogata que combina 
Mi melena, la tuya y la del sol 
Un retrato de fuego, Catalina 
Con rutina de lento caracol 
Labio sobre labio, sobre labio 
Y la península mía 
En tu bahía",Catalina Bahia [*],1997

Andrés Calamaro,"Sentiste alguna vez lo que es, tener el corazon roto?
(Sentiste) a los asuntos pendientes volver, hasta volverte (muy) loco?
Si resulta que si, si podrás entender, lo que me pasa a mi esta noche
Ella no va a volver y la pena me empieza a crecer (adentro)
La moneda callo por el lado de la soledad y el dolor

Todo lo que termina termina mal, poco a poco, 
Y si no termina se contamina mal, y eso se cubre de polvo
Me parece que soy de la quinta que vio el mundial setenta y ocho
Me toco crecer viendo a mi alrededor paranoia y dolor
La moneda callo por el lado de la soledad (otra vez)
 
No me lastimes con tus crímenes perfectos
Mientras la gente indiferente se da cuenta
De vez en cuando solamente sale afuera la peor madera
Si resulta que si, si podrás entender, lo que me pasa a mi esta noche
Ella no va a volver y la pena me empieza a crecer (adentro)

Le molesto la luna 
Por la ventana abierta

Llego una carta desde el frente

Cuando despierte del todo 
Y borrar con la mano 
Lo que ayer escribió con el codo

Si la crónica Verónica reacciona
La Verónica mitad 
Tiene muy poca maldad 
Pero esta cansada de esperar

Media Verónica esta rota

Pero le hicieron daño

Rompió una lanza por la risa
Pero no tiene prisa 
Y se ríe muy poco

No va a saber que hacer cuando 
No sople mas viento
No sabe distinguir 
El amor de cualquier sentimiento

Quiere vivir
Una vida diferente cada día
La Verónica mitad 
Esta en la flor de la edad 
Pero esta cansada de esperar 

En la ventana hay una nota

Andrés Calamaro,"El gaucho se despierta a la mañana 
Y mira el horizonte otra vez 
Lleva sin dormir una semana 
Perdió una china de rojo libanés 
Que esta pasando 
Algo esta cambiando! 
Siempre era el que apagaba la luz 
Que esta pasando 
Grita el viejo armando 
Mientras hace trampas en el mus 
Que verde que amanece con María 
Que fácil que parece el porvenir 
Cuando el el gaucho 
Saluda al nuevo día 
Que bien 

Hoy va a comer! 
Pobrecitos animales de la granja 
Les falta el alimento 
Principal, a la vaca que da chocolate 
Le queda chocolate comercial 
Que esta pasando 
Algo esta cambiando! 
Siempre era el que apagaba la luz 
Que esta pasando 
Grita el viejo armando 
Mientras hace trampas en el mus 
Que verde era mi valle cuando había 
Una china siempre en mi habitación, eso si 
La cama nunca esta vacía 

No es igual, nunca es igual 
Que esta pasando? algo esta cambiando 
Siempre era el que apagaba la luz 
Que esta pasando 
Grita el viejo armando
Y le hace trampas en el mus
Parece que no hay mal que resista mucho sueño y ayuno 
Nos dicen que hagamos otras cosas 
Y especialmente 
Que nos miremos ciertos líquidos 
Periódicamente 
Asiduamente 
Pero yo no conozco mal que resista 

A veinte horas de sueño y un prudente ayuno 
Ayuno quiere decir 
Por ejemplo 
Tomar gazpacho y ajo blanco 
Y en invierno guisos con abundante tocino, y pan 
Y darse cuenta de que no siempre 
Que una piensa que se va a morir y que esta hecho polvo 
Se muere uno 
Y entonces si tenemos miedo 
No evitamos el dolor 
Pero encima lo anticipamos, quiero decir
Para seguir viviendo, a veces
Con tal de estar sanos, vamos a hacernos chequeos 

Nos preocupamos por que nos ha salido una mancha 
Un dolor, nuestra meta es vivir largo tiempo 
Y claro 
En el fondo no pretendemos vivir largo tiempo 
Pretendemos vivir a secas, pretendemos vivir 
Si uno intenta vivir largo tiempo el día a día 
Se puede envenenar bastante 
Pero si uno no intenta cuidarse tampoco es buen plan 
Uno confunde la valentía con la temeridad 
Se granjea grandes cantidades de dolor 
De modo que es muy delicado 
Cuentan de Alejandro que una vez 

Se metió en un río tumultuoso de la India 
Todo con barro 
Persiguiendo al ejercito que peleaba con el 
Y que cuando iban en mitad 
Los caballos perdieron pie 
Aquellas aguas estaban heladas 
Y se volvió a sus compañeros y les dijo 
""me cago en la leche 
Os dais cuenta las cosas que tengo que hacer 
Para que me tengáis respeto?""

Pero te deseo el bien

Pero por lo que más quieras
No me pises los zapatos de piel

Justifíco con reservas la escopeta 
Es horrible pero era previsible 
Eso no arruína a la gente de argentina

Y tenés un sentimiento, el viento 
Aunque te guste agitar 
Te podés emocionar 
Y esperar una revancha 
Te sentís vivo en la cancha 
Te sentís vivo enla plaza 
Fumando algo, riéndote de nada 
Y con todo en contra tuyo 
Te felicíto, tenés un par 
No vas allegar, pero siempre 
Siempre con orgullo

Andrés Calamaro,"Mi vida fuimos a volar 
Con un sólo paracaídas 
Uno solo va a quedar 
Flotando a la deriva
Vivir así, no es vivir 
Esperando y esperando
Porque vivir es jugar 
Y yo quiero seguir jugando
Le dije a mi corazón 
Sin gloria pero sin pena
No cometas el crimen varón 
Si no vas a cumplir la condena

Quiero vivir dos veces 
Para poder olvidarte 
Quiero llevarte conmigo 
Y no voy a ninguna parte
No te preocupes paloma 
Hoy no estoy adentro mío 
Tu amor es mi enfermedad
Soy un envase vació
No te preocupes paloma 
No hay pájaros en el nido 
Dos ilusiones se irán a volar 
Pero otras dos han venido
Si me olvido de vivir 
Colgado del sentimiento
Voy a vivir para repetir

Otra vez, este momento
Te bajaría del cielo mujer
La luna hasta tu cama
Porque es muy poco de amor 
Solo una vez por semana
Pase precio a mi libertad 
Y nadie quiso pagarlo 
Te cambio tu corazón por el mío 
Para mirarlo y mirarlo
Ampas de gloria mujer
Quiero un pedazo de cielo 
Para invitarte a dormir 
En la cama o en el suelo
Un sacrificio ritual
Bien o mal
Yo quiero hacerla mi estrella 
Sin principio ni final 
No puedo vivir sin ella",Paloma,1999

Why esta vez soy yo quien se queda en silencio why en soledad

Why el flaco Abel, que se nos fue, 
Pero aún me guía...

Nací a las penas, 
Bebí mis años 
Why me entregué sin luchar...

No dejo de esperar el nuestro partiéndome

Esos son los que tienen un solo corazón. 
Mira que las revoluciones de los corazones 
No perdonan pero tampoco tienen perdón.

Pero cuesta mucho verla sonreír
Lorena es todas o ninguna
O puede ser alguna para mí

No te olvides de decirle si algún día pasas
Por la puerta de la casa de Lorena
Que sigo vivo y nunca me olvidé de recordar

Ni todos mis pecados son pecados capitales
Ni corona de laurel
Y nunca te arrepientas si fuiste buena
Lorena lo hace por vos
Hay que ser hombre para olvidar una mujer
Si no hay otra igual

Flaca, no me claves tus puñales
Que los males del amor me duelen más
Nunca te lo dije pero quiero
Arrancarte y comerte el corazón

Tiene tantos pecados
Con razón Lorena también ganó su lugar
De angustias y de alcohol
Lorena no siente pena por nadie
A Lorena nadie le debe un favor
Desde nena que a Lorena le enseñaron
Que en la vida nunca es nada por amor

No te olvides de decirle si algún día pasas
Por la puerta de la casa de Lorena
Que sigo vivo y nunca me olvidé de recordar

Tengo a Lorena en las venas
Por la sangre se me metió
Es como una droga cualquiera
Es necesidad, es amor

Esquivando charcos, lagunas, ríos y mares
Y no quiero volver a verte nunca triste, sola

No existe el recuerdo

Y ciego, ciego, no supe ver

Andrés Calamaro,"El crimen desorganizado entra y sale de mi casa 
O van a la casa de al lado
Todos mis amigos son iguales 
Y los que no son iguales son tan diferentes que somos ausentes
Hace poco un amigo volvió arrepentido a su casa
Y ya por acá ni pasa, ni el teléfono atiende
Serán las indicaciones del psiquiatra: 
""seguí con el ribo pero ni te juntes con el músico furtivo"" 
No lo culpo, a mí me pasó algo muy parecido
Y me desintoxiqué, engordé 
Y desayunaba al mediodía cinco minutos de felicidad
¿La verdad? Que a veces mataría por otros cinco minutos más
¿Y que más? El resto de la vida 
¿La vida? ¿Cuál vida? 
La mía te asustaría
A mí que la vida me gusta también me asusta
La verdad que tengo momentos de debilidad
Y quiero ir al cine, ir a cenar al lado de una pareja de amigos
Hablar de Jarsmuch y Abel Ferrara

Y ninguna mañana rara

Miro a los otros que son como yo …mala vida
Si no se suicidaron ya fue por cobardía
Cómo quisiera ser tan diferente 
Que haber recibido a cambio de ser un solitario del carajo
Un buen trabajo, facilidad musical, violencia intelectual
Fama, respeto…no esta mal
Pero la herida es mortal
No estoy solo, de verdad
Me acompaña mi propia soledad
De verdad, me acompaña mi propia soledad
¿Nadie sabe lo que pasa con la gente diferente? 
El bohemio se pudrió mucho antes del milenio
¿Y el reo? Queda feo en un mundo grasa
¿Qué pasa con los vagabundos y los borrachines y los soñadores? 
Yo te digo que pasa: se quedan sin casa y 
La vida moderna los arrasa
Los pasa por arriba y se los morfa, se los come 
O los encierra bajo dieta de cyndor y cocaína 
O les lame el orto esperando que terminen arrastrándose
No lo sé

A mi me parece claro como el agua podrida
Cest la vida
Cest la vida
Interminablemente se vuelve uno decadente
Y en una sociedad que engorda mostrás los huesos
Esos huesos
Ese abandono ¿Será la capa de ozono? 
No lo sé

No pasa nada
A mí me parece claro como el agua podrida
Así es la vida

También olvidarme de mi pasado 
Bailo mejor acostado y no se olvidar

Sin deseartela de una manera loca
Necesito controlar tu vida
Saber quien te besa y quien te abriga

Hacé falta que te diga
Que me muero por tener algo contigo

Aunque pueda parecerte un desatino
No quisiera yo morirme sin tener

Y guapeando en la senda por esos cerros

Se han dormido las luces del pedregal
Y animando a la tropa, dale que dale

Que haga menos pesada la soledad
Como sombra en la sombra por esos cerros

Y en la distancia, muero día a día, sin saberlo tú

El resto de este nuestro amor quedó
Muy lejos olvidado para ti
Viviendo en el pasado aún estoy
Aunque todo ya cambio
Sé que no te olvidaré

Cuántas veces yo pensé volver
Y decir que de mi amor nada cambió
Pero mi silencio fue mayor
Y en la distancia, muero día a día

Pensé en dejar de amarte alguna vez
Fue algo tan difícil de intentar
Si alguna vez mi amor piensas en mí
Ten presente al recordar, que nunca te olvidé

Y decir que de mi amor nada cambió
Pero mi silencio fue mayor
Y en la distancia, muero día a día, sin saberlo

Y en cada verso pone su corazón
Al yuyo de suburbio su voz perfuma

Malena tiene penas de bandoneón
Tal vez allá en la infancia su voz de alondra

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena canta el tango con voz de sombra
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Tus tangos son criaturas abandonadas
Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

Malena canta el tango con voz quebrada
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Es cuando la estupidez gana por afano
A la suerte que nunca llega si la estamos esperando
Cómo? Cuándo? Y por qué? 
Son demasiadas preguntas para hacerle al destino
A veces estamos finos y otras veces nada que ver
Pues hay que caminar antes de empezar a correr

Su boca que era mía ya no me besa más
Se apagaron los ecos de su reír sonoro
Y es cruel este silencio que me hace tanto mal

Fue mía la piadosa dulzura de sus manos
Que dieron a a mi pecho caricias de bondad
Y ahora que la evoco, hundido en mi quebranto
Las lágrimas trenzadas se niegan a brotar
Y no tengo el consuelo de poder llorar

Por qué sus alas tan cruel quemó la vida
Por qué esa mueca siniestra de la suerte
Quise abrigarla y más pudo la muerte
Cómo me duele y se ahonda esa herida

Yo sé que ahora vendrán caras extrañas
Con su limosna de alivio a mi tormento
Todo es mentira, mentira es el lamento
Hoy esta sólo mi corazón

Como perros de presa las penas traicioneras
Celando su cariño, galopaban detrás
Y escondida en las aguas de su mirada buena
La muerte agazapada marcaba su compás

En vano yo alentaba febril una esperanza
Clavó en mi carne viva sus garras el dolor
Y mientras en la calle, con loca algarabía
El carnaval del mundo gozaba y se reía burlándose
El destino, me robó mi amor

Por qué sus alas tan cruel quemó la vida
Por qué esa mueca siniestra de la suerte
Quise abrigarla y más pudo la muerte
Cómo me duele y se ahonda esa herida

La quieta calle que en el eco dijo
Tuya es mi vida, tuyo es mi querer, bajo el burlón mirar de las estrellas
Que con indiferencia hoy me ven volver

Volver con la frente marchita
Las nieves del tiempo, platearon mi sien
Sentir que es un soplo la vida, que veinte años no es nada
Que febril la mirada, errante en la sombra te busca y te nombra

Vivir, con el alma aferrada a un dulce recuerdo que lloro otra vez
Tengo miedo el encuentro con el pasado
Que vuelve a enfrentarse con mi vida, tengo miedo
De las noches que pobladas de recuerdos encadenan mi llorar

Pero el viajero que huye, tarde o temprano detiene su andar
Y aunque el olvido que todo destruye haya matado mi vieja ilusión
Queda escondida una esperanza humilde
Que es toda la fortuna de mi corazón

Volver con la frente marchita
Las nieves del tiempo, platearon mi sien
Sentir que es un soplo la vida, que veinte años no es nada

Andrés Calamaro,"Me acobardó la soledad
Y el miedo enorme de morir lejos de tí
Qué ganas tuve de llorar
Sintiendo junto a mí

La burla de la realidad
Y el corazón me suplicó
Que te buscara
Y que le diera tu querer

Me lo pedía el corazón
Y entonces te busqué
Creyéndote mi salvación

Y ahora que estoy frente a ti
Parecemos, ya ves, dos extraños
Lección que por fin aprendí
Cómo cambian las cosas los años

Angustia de saber muertas ya
La ilusión y la fe
Perdón si me ves lagrimear
Los recuerdos me han hecho mal

Palideció la luz del sol
Al escucharte fríamente conversar
Fue tan distinto nuestro amor
Y duele comprobar, que todo, todo terminó

Qué gran error volverte a ver
Para llevarme destrozado el corazón
Son mil fantasmas, al volver
Burlándose de mí, las horas de ese muerto ayer

",Como Dos Extraños [Tango],2006
Andrés Calamaro,"Acaricia mi ensueño
El suave murmullo
De tu suspirar

Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros
Me quieren mirar

Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella aquieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color

Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contarán su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos mirarán pasar

Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciernagas curiosas que verán
Que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá más que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial

Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodía
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzará sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor

Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras

Bajo la quieta luz de un farol

Se me pianta un lagrimón

Es un beso prolongao
Que te da mi corazón

Cuna de tauras y cantores
De broncas y entreveros
De todos mis amores

En tus muros con mi acero

En mezcla gaucha de indio con español
De piel y voz morochas vi en mi guitarra
Que al mundo van las coplas, y me fui yo

Con un rumor de nido volaban tras de mí
Aquellos pañuelitos en la estación
Pero soy peregrino y a mi nostalgia
Le canto así en la oreja del corazón

Vamos a la distancia, sí
Que soy el trovador
Si la distancia llama
Yo jamás veré ponerse el sol

Vamos a la distancia ya
Y si no llego, amor
Vos le darás mi alma
De argentino y de cantor

Mi casa es donde canto porque aprendí a escuchar
La voz de Dios que afina en cualquier lugar
Ecos que hay en las plazas y en las cocinas
Al borde de una cuna y atrás del mar

Si en esta andanza un día me espera la vejez
Ya mi niñez le hará la segunda voz
Y al fin con dos gargantas, a mi agonía
Le cantaré en la oreja del corazón

Vamos a la distancia, sí
Que soy el trovador

Que al jugar sonriendo el amor que está mintiendo
Quema en una hoguera todo mi querer

Mil veces la vida ¿Para qué vivir? 

Cuántos desegaños por una cabeza

Pero si un mirar me hiere al pasar
Su boca de fuego otra vez quiero besar

Basta de gerberas, se acabó la timba
Un final reñido ya no vuelvo a amar
Pero si algún pingo llega a ser fija el domingo 
Yo me juego entero ¿qué le voy a hacer?

Andrés Calamaro,"San Juan y boedo antigua  y todo el cielo
Pompeya y más allá la inundación
Tu melena de novia en el recuerdo
Y tu nombre florando en el adiós

La esquina del herrero, barro y pampa
Tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjón
Y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
Que me llena de nuevo el corazón

Sur, paredón y después
Sur, una luz de almacén
Ya nunca me verás cómo me vieras
Recostado en la vidriera y esperándote

Ya nunca alumbraré con las estrellas
Nuestra marcha sin querellas
Por las noches de Pompeya

Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
Y mi amor y tu ventana
Todo ha muerto, ya lo sé

San Juan y boedo antiguo, cielo perdido
Pompeya y al llegar al terraplén
Tus veinte años temblando de cariño
Bajo el beso que entonces te robé

Nostalgias de las cosas que han pasado
Arena que la vida se llevó
Pesadumbre de barrios que han cambiado
Y amargura del sueño que murió

",Sur [Tango],2006
Andrés Calamaro,"Paredón, tinta roja en el gris del ayer
Tu emoción de ladrillo, feliz
Sobre mi callejón, con un borrón
Pintó la esquina

Y el botón que
En el ancho de la noche
Puso el filo de la ronda
Como un broche

Y aquel buzón carmín y aquel fondín
Donde lloraba el tano
Un rubio amor lejano
Que mojaba con bon vin

¿Dónde estará mi arrabal?
¿Quién se robó mi niñez?
¿En qué rincón, luna mía
Volcás, como entonces
Tu clara alegría?

Veredas que yo pisé
Malevos que ya no son
Bajo tu cielo de raso
Trasnocha un pedazo
De mi corazón

Paredón, tinta roja en el gris del ayer
Borbotón de mi sangre infeliz
Que vertí en el malvón
De aquel balcón que la escondía

Yo no sé
Si fue negro de mis penas
O fue rojo de tus venas
Mi sangría

Porque llegó y se fue tras el carmín
Y el gris fondín lejano
Donde lloraba el tano
Sus nostalgias de bon vin

",Tinta Roja [Tango],2006
Andrés Calamaro,"Se llamaba Soledad y estaba sola 
Como un puerto maltratado por las olas 
Coleccionaba mariposas tristes 
Direcciones de calles que no existen 
Pero tuvo el antojo de jugar 
Hacer conmigo una excepción 
Y primero nso fuimos a bailar 
Y en mitad de un te quiero me olvidó 

Esperanza no tenía más que el nombre 
La que no esperaba nada de los hombres 
Coleccionaba amores desgraciados 
Soldaditos de plomo mutilados 
Pero quiso una noche comprobar 
Para que sirve un corazón 
Y prendió un cigarrillo y otro mas 
Como toda esperanza se esfumó

Por eso cuando el tiempo hace resumen 
Y los sueños parecen pesadillas 
Regresa aquel perfume de fotos amarillas 
Y aunque se que no era la más guapa del mundo 
Juro que era más guapa, más guapa que cualquiera

Se llama Inmaculada aquella puta 
Que curaba el sarampión de los reclutas 
Coleccionaba nubes de verano 
Velos de tul roidos por gusanos 
Pero quiso querese enamorar 
Como una rubia del montón 
Y que yo la sacara de la calle 
De los besos sin amor

Y vi la luz después cuando otros gatos 
Desordenan mis noches de locura 
Evoco aquellos ratos de torpes calenturas 
Y aunque se que no era la más guapa del mundo 
Juro que era más guapa, más guapa que cualquiera 
Más guapa que cualquiera 
Más guapa que cualquiera",Más Guapa Que Cualquiera,2007
Andrés Calamaro,"Mirando el río una rumbita te escribí
Mientras te esperaba
Con el pechito inquieto y alegre
Y un andar de no ser de acá

De aquí no me moví de tu vértigo mío
De tu sonrisa vertical
Que misteriosa es una rosa de Hiroshima
Y la rumba que hay

La rumba se ríe, no sabe si es rumba
Será un momento nada más
De eternidad, de esos que me da

Todos los días, todos los segundos
Infinitamente, la alegría de vivir
El sentido que da la vida vivir contigo

En el cielo
En el suelo, en cada una de tus cosas
En el cielo
En el suelo, en cada una de tus cosas

O es una serpiente de muchas cabezas

No son cuchillos en los dientes
No son martes de carnaval de Brasil

No son canciones urgentes
No son asuntos pendientes
No son martes de carnaval de Brasil
(Tristeza nao tein fim)

Habrá que desenvainar las espadas del texto
Y escribir una canción
Aunque no haya algún pretexto
Y dedicársela al primero que pase caminando

Al que se quedó pensando, al que no quiere pensar
Al olvido selectivo, a la memoria perdida
A los de los pedazos de vida que no vamos a perder
Jamás

No son cuchillos en los dientes

No son asuntos pendientes

Porque existe la vida eterna
Lleva de parte mía un cucumelo
Por si no llovía en el cielo

Y de parte de los 22
Se lo das al chico, cuartetero
Y dale un abrazo muy largo
A mis amigos que se fueron primero

También lleva algunas canciones de nosotros
Que van a causar gran posterioridad
Supongo que habrá una ciudad entera
Y me sirve de consuelo, si me esperas allá

Muchos amigos se fueron antes que yo
Y me dejaron solo, por eso si el invierno hace frío
También bajo al infierno un poco

Supongo que nadie se va del todo
Espero que exista algún lugar
Donde los chicos escuchen mis canciones
Aunque no los escuche opinar

Toma una lista de mis amigos
Quiero convencerlos que vuelvan conmigo
Si no van a esperar mucho, y hace mucho
Que los quiero ver

Trajo un cartón de Resero

Desde hoy me vas a amar

Quiero volar contigo juntos al cielo azul
Si alguien va a estar conmigo
Quiero que seas tu

Andrés Calamaro,"Cuáles fueron tus últimas palabras 
Tu último destello de conciencia
Que dejaste escrito en una carta
Que canción elegiste escuchar

Si sabemos que nacimos condenados
Porque somos tan sensibles al amor
De la ausencia a la nostalgia se patina
En recuerdos que pudimos recordar

Y reconocer mirando fijamente al sol
Tu última mirada

Gracias por la amistad 
Y por la genialidad
Por el mate con torta frita
Por el joint
Por llevarme a un japonés por primera vez 
Por tu afecto y tu sinceridad
Por ponerle armonía a la ciudad 
Por la mágica y perfecta melodía
Y el embrujo de tu canto de pájaro cantor 
Que echó a volar",Belgrano,2013
Andrés Calamaro,"Bohemio es ser la sombra de encontrarle el sentido a las cosas
Bohemio es un deseo de a destiempo, también es necesidad
Te quiero porque a pesar de todo, te vas a seguir queriendo un poco más
Permite que me saque el sombrero para saludarte, libertad

Bohemio en tu deseo de aferrarse a las espinas de las rosas
Bohemio que prefiere que la noche lo acompañe a caminar
Te quiero porque adentro del abismo vas a seguir siendo el mismo, para mí
Permite que me incline ante tu sombra cuando el cántaro se rompa, libertad

Primero sé que voy camino a nada, pero a veces no me importa y naufragás
Permite que te rinda un homenaje en mi permanente raje, libertad

Anoche te escribí nuevas canciones, eso solo significa 
Que le robé palabras a tu ausencia para tratar de seguir
Primero sé que voy camino a nada, pero a veces no me importa y naufragás
Permite que me incline ante tu sombra cuando un cántaro se rompa, libertad
Te quiero porque a pesar de todo, te vas a seguir queriendo un poco más
Permite que me saque el sombrero para saludarte, libertad",Bohemio,2013
Andrés Calamaro,"Cuando no estás o me encuentro en otro lugar de mundo
Cuando no estás me equivoco cada medio segundo
Cuando no estás la soledad me aconseja mal

Cuando no estás no se abre el paracaídas y salto igual
Y me pierdo en habitaciones vacías
Cuando no estás, cuando no estás conmigo

Cuando no estás la casa vacía pregunta cuando volverás
Y escribo versos crueles conmigo
Cuando no estás estoy esperando que vuelvas

Cuando no estás me paso el día contando minutos
Cuando no estás o me pierdo en un laberinto oscuro
Cuando no estás la soledad me aconseja mal

Cuando no estás la casa vacía pregunta cuando volverás
Y escribo versos un poco crueles conmigo
Cuando no estás estoy esperando que vuelvas

Cuando no estás la casa vacía pregunta cuando volverás
Y escribo versos crueles conmigo
Cuando no estás estoy esperando que vuelvas

Cuando no estás, solo espero verte llegar por esa puerta
Lo que ocurre cuando vuelves que te quiero más,
Estoy esperando que vuelvas

Cuando no estás conmigo
Cuando no estás conmigo
Cuando no estás conmigo",Cuando no estás,2013
Andrés Calamaro,"Dentro de una canción esta la vida 
Dentro de una canción llegará mañana

Entra lo que sale dentro de una canción 
Sobra lo que cabe dentro de una canción 
Miente como puedas dentro de una canción 
Porque dentro de una canción nos vamos

Dentro de una canción brindamos 
Dentro de una canción nos damos un beso 

Por eso voy a vivir dentro de una canción 
Una canción va a llevarme a volar en alfombra 

Una canción te nombra dentro de una canción 
Dentro de la propia sombra de una canción está la vida

Sólo se que voy a vivir dentro de una canción

Buen día a primeros silencios de la mañana

Buen día extraños asuntos de nariz y garganta
Desayuno ravioles cuando viene clareando el día

Buen día nariz estancada de corte español
Buen día, el futuro es posible como somos
Extraño todo el tiempo tu tacto divino

Y permitirme vivir mis horarios imposibles

Tomarme con calma lo que haga falta tomarme
Aunque me traten de reventado y egoísta
Voy a vivir como quiera el resto del día
Extraño demasiado tu tacto divino

Buen día al dormir cuando se me da la gana
Buen día ser el único habitante del planeta
Buen día y adiós para siempre intentar ser distinto

En barajas, el colmo del síndrome estocolmo
Como aquella temporada cultural
Con rehenes, atados al piano rojo

Vayamos pintados con sangre de los dos
Siempre, siempre

Nos esperan con balas de plata dulce
Fundidas de arreglos dentales nuestros
Un hombre es un campo de batalla
Si no se calla es una revolución de claveles

Vayamos pintados con sangre de los dos
Siempre, siempre 

Entonces era la libertad
A veces mataría por cinco minutos más
Entonces era la libertad
Ahora me toca huir a mí, nene

Andrés Calamaro,"Dicen que cuando hay amor 
No hace falta pedir perdón 
Pero yo ya pedí perdón tantas veces

necesita acción, no puedo negar 
la razón algunas veces
Dicen que primero hay que saber sufrir
para después amar, para después partir
Dicen que en su destino inconstante 
Solo el gaucho vive errante donde la 
Suerte lo lleva

Perdón vida de mi vida, perdón si es que te he faltado
por mi saldría el sol todos los días 
Por mi no existirían heridas

Voy a tratar de mostrar mi mejor estabilidad 
Pero dudo de mi virtud en el equilibrio
Dicen que para escribir es indispensable sufrir 
Y no puedo quitarle razón a tantos poetas 
Algunos se encierran solos durante 40 años 
Los daños son las tintas de sus lapiceros
No puedo evitar la suerte como no puedo evitar vivir 
Prefiero sonreír todo lo que pueda

Perdón vida de mi vida, perdón si es que te he faltado
por mi saldría el sol todos los días 
Por mi no existirían heridas

Lo que ha pasado allí en la hacienda de la flor
La triste historia de un ranchero enamorado
Que fue borracho, parrandero y jugador
Juan se llamaba, y lo apodaban charrasqueado
Era valiente y arriesgado en el amor
A las mujeres más bonitas se llevaba
En aquellos campos no quedaba ni una flor
Un día domingo que se andaba emborrachando
A la cantina le corrieron a avisar

""Cuídate juan que ya por ahí te andan buscando
Son muchos hombres no te vayan a matar""
No tuvo tiempo de montar en su caballo
Pistola en mano se le echaron de a montón
Estoy borracho les gritaba y soy buen gallo
Cuando una bala atravesó su corazón

Creció la milpa con la lluvia en el potrero
Y las palomas van volando al pedregal
Bonitos toros llevan hoy al matadero
Que buen caballo va montando el caporal
Ya las campanas del santuario están doblando

Todos los fieles se dirigen a rezar
Y por el cerro los rancheros van bajando
A un hombre muerto que lo llevan a enterrar
En una choza muy humilde llora un niño
Y las mujeres le aconsejan y se van
Mientras su madre lo consuela con cariño
Mirando al cielo llora y reza por su Juan
Aquí termino de cantar este corrido
De Juan ranchero, charrasqueado y burlador
Que se creyó de las mujeres consentido
Que fue borracho, parrandero y jugador",Juan Charrasqueado,2017

Andrés Cepeda,"Tengo ganas
Tengo tiempo
Y mil canciones que cantarte
Tengo historias
Tengo cosas que contarte
Mas hoy tengo tu llegada

Es tan lindo
Cuando existe un sentimiento
Y cuando quieres
Cuando cuentas sin callarte
Que prefieres
Por ejemplo yo quisiera si no es mucho
Que te quedes

Dame solo un momento
Dame amor del mas cierto
No te pido mas nada
Dame de tu mirada
Y de tus sentimientos
Siente si estoy sintiendo

No te quedes
No revises el pasado que entristece
No te niegues si el amor
Te pertenece
Ven y siéntate a mi lado mira el dia
Que amanece

No respondas callada
Mucho menos ahora
No me digas mañana
Es que vi que pasabas
Me acerque por que pienso
Que por ti yo esperaba

Tengo tiempo
Y mil canciones que cantarte
Tengo historias tengo cosas que contarte

Voy a darte

Andrés Cepeda,"Que se quede el infinito sin estrellas

Andrés Cepeda,"Se necesita amarte mucho mucho
Para poder perdonarte como siempre lo hago yo
Y a condición de ser esclavo tuyo
No se como dejarte aunque quisiera yo

No verte nunca mas
Te quisiera arrancar de una vez de mi vida
No te puedo negar, que no se respirar si no te siento mía

No se que hacer contigo
Me tienes embrujado
Si fueras mi enemigo
No me harías tanto daño

Se necesita ser tarado y ciego para poder darse cuenta de que perdí tu amor
Y para no sufrir vivo sueño
Me imagino que me amas aunque yo se que no

No verte nunca mas
Te quisiera arrancar de una vez de mi vida
No te puedo negar, que no se respirar si no te siento mía

No se que hacer contigo
Me tienes embrujado

Soporto este destino

Andrés Cepeda,"Donde ya no te tengo 
Ha crecido una pena 
Que me araña por dentro 

Donde ya no te tengo 
De tanto suspirar 
Me escuece el sentimiento 

Donde ya no te tengo 
Se marcho la alegría sin poder 
Despedirse de mí 
Y hay un trozo de alma 
Donde ya no te tengo 
Que pregunta por ti 

La vida es una vela 
Que va apagando el viento 
El mar se ha vuelto llanto 
Se me ha empedrado el cielo 
Y me duele tanto el día 
Que el sol se evaporo 
Y de dolor parece que 
Solo quedo yo 

Que te condene Dios 
Que yo no puedo 
Arráncame la vida 
Con todo lo que tengo 
Y que te condene Dios

Donde ya no te tengo 
Me quede viendo el vuelo 
De una lagrima al viento

Se apago el firmamento 
Y cayo el cielo encima de mí 
Y hay un trozo de alma

Pero éste amor que ya ha sobrevivido al tiempo
Cuando digo que jamás tendra un error
Poco a poco siento tu arrepentimiento

No sabía que dentro de ti yo iba encontrar la luz
No sabia que existía un mundo así
No sabía que podía ser tan feliz
Y la vida pasaba de largo vacía sin emoción
No había nada flotando en el aire abrazándome el corazón
Y llegaste tú y el mundo me abrazo
Y llegaste tú y el mundo se paro

Y llegaste tú y me sorprendió
El poder que había en este amor
Y llegaste tú una bendición
Aún recuerdo el momento en que todo cambió
Y llegaste tú y me sorprendió
El poder que hay en este amor

Que esté contento
Y no les hable más de desamor
La gente quiere
Que siga atento
Me esta cambiando hasta la voz
Pero la gente no sabe de ti
Pero la gente no entiende

Ey, supungo estarás bien
Por aquí todo igual
Aunque no te importe
Cada vez me olvido más de ti
Canté con Milanés
Grabé un disco en Madrid
Ya no te veo en cualquier cielo gris
Ya diferencio colores

Voy a hacerte una canción
Que hable en realidad de ti
Voy a ser la habitación
Donde te miraba al dormir
Voy a hacer de ti
Solo una canción
Que será Madrid
Sin nosotros dos
Háblale de mi
A otro como yo
Yo estaré sin ti
Tu estarás mejor

Ey, supongo estarás bien
Supongo ya demás
Supongo olvidarías hasta el nombre del hostal
Donde te vi feliz
Donde me hiciste hablar
Fue la noche más bella del mundo
Dijo no recuerdo nada
Despertando al día siguiente
Se vistió y entre la gente
A otro sueño que se apaga
Dijo que no era tan mala
Pero no era diferente

Dijo llámame mañana
Y mañana dura siempre
Dije vuélvete a la cama
Quién supiera que se siente
Cuando lleva la corriente
En la más hermosa playa
Voy a hacer de ti
Solo una canción
Que será Madrid
Sin nosotros dos
Háblale de mi

Andrés Suárez,"Como llueve en Sevilla, un otoño marrón
El hotel es un acto de amor para dos
Pero tú no estás, vida
He bajado a la calle
Me ha subido el calor
Del acento que quiere escuchar mi colchón
Era un sábado tarde

Y ahí voy, doblando una esquina se dobla el amor
Había una morena vendiendo pulseras
Gritando veloz, cantando saetas
La miro, me voy
Pero di la vuelta
¿qué hago? Me digo
Me mira se ríe de mi
Si quieres gallego te llevo hasta el río
Le dije que si
Fui a una torre que brillaba y vi como nos temblaba el cielo
Fue como lo cuento fue así,
Olvide que había concierto
Fuimos, en pasado, a un entablao flamenco
Y pude ver el cielo desde abajo cuando dijo susurrando
Dame un beso y no saludes a esa que tienes al lado

Casi amanecía cuando toda la alameda me aplaudió
Cuando mordía más al sur de su cadera y ahí me vine tan arriba
Que pedimos cama y dos mil horas más

Pero al llegar el día, el día siguiente me refiero
Ni siquiera un te quiero en la pared.
Era lo que temía tal vez todo fuera un sueño
Bajé corriendo desnudo y sin fe
Hubiera gritado su nombre pero no lo dijo,
Hubiera dado todo esta vez
Pero al doblar la esquina al día siguiente no había ruido
Y en lugar de llorarla, me callé
Aunque no quede de paso
Cada vez que bajo a cantar
Vuelvo al sitio donde la encontré
Una vez en Marzo
Creí que era ella y me vi
Persiguiendo a una extraña y lloré
Cuando dio la vuelta
Por eso si veis que llueve en Sevilla
Es que estoy recordando su piel",Si Llueve en Sevilla,2015
Andrés Suárez,"Te juraré una vida nueva
Te llevaré volando a Cadiz
Sabrás decir que sí
Me harás un puzzle con dos piezas
De ropa inundando la almohada
Luego te haré reír
Háblame volvamos a escribirnos con los pies

Voy a volver a quererte
Voy a llenarte de notas, voy a dejarte tranquila
Mi vida ahora duerme

Llegarás tarde, quizá colocada
Hablaremos de todo, nos reiremos por nada
Sabré besarte esta vez
Y al llegar al parque habrá un cometa loco
Y un sostén volante

Voy a volver a esperarte, aunque no vuelvas del todo
Voy a rogarte hasta que otro, llene tu cuarto menguante
Voy a volver a quererte, voy a robarte hasta el alba
Voy a dejarte indicada la estrella nuestra de siempre

Andrés Suárez,"Del norte como yo, perdida como todos duerme 
Si quebrara ahora la tierra nos da igual 
Los dos somos del mar, los dos somos la suerte 
De sentirnos diferente a los demás 

De solo corazón, acento añejo roble siente 
Que si ríe bien pudiera ir más allá 
Enmudecer la sal con besos si el poniente 
No pusiera mi futuro en su mirar 

Mientras quede el después de tu pelo danzando en el aire 
No me pidas respeto perdiéndolo en horizontal 

Pretendiendo quererte he mirado de más 
A la noche le faltan estrellas quizás 
Con tu piel tendrán que rendir cuentas 
Represento la fe y no he rezado jamás 
No hay olvido detrás de la noche de ayer 
Quédate o al menos no te muevas 
Y el corazón me arde, y el corazón 

Mientras quede champán y el teléfono siga mojado 
Mientras sobre teatro, segundo papel me da igual 
Permíteme el azar, apaga el escenario

Te hiciera sangrar la boca
De sed o de ganas
No importa
Piensa en el último otra vez

Que puse en tu pelo
Volviendo a tirar la copa
Sonaba sangre española
Bebía por no llover

Que será de ti
Me brindó tu aroma
A la tormenta
Que será de ti
De tu miedo niña
Cuando truena
Que será de mí sin ti

Que un desamor
Duele más no protegerte
Que tu ausencia
Duele más un desamigo
Que un desamor

Si esa primavera
Negara paso al verano
Pusiera el levante amargo
Mis besos en tu ciprés
Ya calló el piano
Que de esa finante pena
Mintió la madera el tallo
Que tanto lloró también

Que será de ti
Dale un beso a todos de mi parte
Que será de ti
Hoy se bate en duelo aquel instante
El día que te fuiste así
Sin tu equipaje

Duele más un desamigo
Que un desamor
Duele más aun no saber
Si ya eres madre

That saved a wretch like me. 
I once was lost but now I'm found, 
Was blind but now I see. 

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear, 
The hour I first believed. 

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far

Andrew Bain,"Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up and turning me down
Making me smile and making me frown

In a world that was small
I once lived in a time there was peace with no trouble at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling unknown shook my heart, made me want you to stay
All of my nights and all of my days

I gotta tell you now
Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Something has invaded my mind
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
Changing the grey and changing the blue
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you

I've got to know if this is the real thing
I've got to know what's making my heart sing
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime
Each minute spent with you is the right time
Every hour, every day
You touch me and my mind goes astray",Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart,2008
Andrew Barrett,"Day by day, night after night
Blinded by the neon lights
Hurry here, hustlin' there
No one's got the time to spare
Money's tight, nothin' free
Won't somebody come and rescue me
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
Stranded, caught in the crossfire

Tooth for tooth, eye for an eye
Sell your soul just to buy buy buy
Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime
Come on can't you see that I
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

I need some kind of kindness
Some kind of sympathy oh no
We're stranded, caught in the crossfire

Save the strong, lose the weak
Never turning the other cheek
Trust nobody, don't be no fool

You got to roll with the punches and get what's real

Can't you see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean?

If we should meet, just walk on by

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line 
Oh-oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
But there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
Oh-oh, someday girl I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
And we'll walk in the sun

And let the wind blow 
Back your hair

And I know you're lonely 
For words that I ain't spoken 
But tonight we'll be free 
All the promises'll be broken 
There were ghosts in the eyes 
Of all the boys you sent away 
They haunt this dusty beach road 
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets 
They scream your name at night in the street 
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet 
And in the lonely cool before dawn 
You hear their engines roaring on 
But when you get to the porch they're gone

and old rivers grow wilder every day,
but old people, they just grow lonesome

He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.

Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, ""Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do.""

Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)

Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
But here they come again to jack my style

That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm Mmm

Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change.
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again

Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

(Come on)

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on.
Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!

Well, that is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call ""love""
When I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from
Some terrible nights ah 

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh

The other night you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up but we'd both agree

Andrew E. Postell,"A thousand years, they waited for
Someone who would be true,
And now the empty years have passed,
The sunlight shines anew.
Someone who knows no fear,
I feel him near.
The child was born to be a king, a king,
And the time has come.
He tamed the wild wind when he passed,
The birds and beasts he knew,
Until he came to rest, at last,
The tall gates he passed through.
Someone who knows no fear,
I feel him near.
The child was born to be a king, a king,
And the time has come.
And now the story's just begun.
A thousand years to stay.
We wake each morning with the sun
To live our dreams away.

Andrew Gold,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you    I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you    I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?    How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you    I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no vitories
In all our histories, without love

When did this bed get so wide
Why can't I concentrate?
What good's a brand new start
After true love walks out?
Where do I put my heart?

Of just how forgiving you would be

When I come home,
I'm all alone

Who do I kiss goodnight?
How come I sleep so late
When did this bed get so wide
Why can't I concentrate?
What good's a brand new start
After true love walks out?
Where do I put my heart?
Nowhere now, nowhere now

Our tragic disses
A million kisses, 
Give or take a few
No one to give them to

Ahh
Who do I kiss goodnight?
How come I sleep so late
When did this bed get so wide
Why can't I concentrate?
What good's a brand new start
After true love walks out?
Where do I put my heart?
Nowhere now, nowhere now
Nowhere now, nowhere now

Andrew Gold,"I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Andrew Gold,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you    I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you    I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?    How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you    I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no vitories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you    I'm lost without you
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust,
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you    I'm mad about you",The Final Frontier [DVD],2006

Andrew Hardin,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",El  Gallo del Cielo,1994

The desperate dance, the kick and the spin
Dust risin' from a cross bred bull, fire meets with pride
The man's come a long way, just for the short ride

His wife's in the grandstands, tryin to swallow the fear
A little baby inside her, who's time's drawing near
The bulls flying high now, then he falls to his side
Their love came a long way, just for the short ride

Two hearts in the darkness, sing a blue lullaby

Beat the drum slowly, for a cowboy's last ride

And when the dust had all settled and the crowd disappeared
The sirens still echo, in an unborn childs ear
Little boys due in April, he has his daddy's blue eyes
He'll always remember, his father's last ride

The sun was fresh on the rise
I met momma at the door, she'd been walking the floor

And momma, I was walking on the moon last night
And two loving arms held me tight
As the stars danced around so bright
I was walking on the moon last night

Young love may be a dream
And some angels fly high just to fall down""

And two loving arms held me tight
As the stars danced around so bright
I was walking on the moon last night

Now the lights of the town are glowing yellow brown

I said, ""Don't worry any more
I've seen daddy put those same stars in your eyes""

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,

Andrew Hill,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,1998
Andrew Jackman,"If I loved you, time and again
I would try to say all I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come
In an easy way, round in circles I'd go

Chorus:

Longing to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Way out on the rim of the hill

Andrew Jackman,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is shining alone.
In the lamplight the whithered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan.
Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses wither away
Like the sunflower I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day
Now Old Deuteronomy, just before dawn
Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to a different jellicle life
Memory, turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Sunlight, through the trees in the summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint

Scratching and biting

All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall

For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree

On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of gold, true is false
Who is who?

Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face?

Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you

Of delight, of Elysian peace

No more notes, no more ghost

To a prosperous year

To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade

Think of it, a secret engagement
Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime

To look never further than this week or next week
Than have no impossible dream?

Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines

Come on, King of the Jews.
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.

Precisely
Our heroine's style

The shooting sticks of the upper-class

Aren't supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl
She'll take a mile

Such a shame she wandered into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person has forced us to be blunt
No we wouldn't mind seeing her at Harrod's
But behind the jewelry counter, not in front

Could there be in our fighting corps

Peron's latest flame
You said it brother

Should you wish to cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess
Just mention her name

That isn't funny

Peron is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing a girl in the army H.Q.
And she's an actress, the last straw
Her only good parts are between her thighs
She should stare at the ceiling, not reach for the skies
Or she could be his last whore

As long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the center where she's not qualified

She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid

Andrew Lane,"People of Europe! I send you the Rainbow of Argentina!

Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes--it doesn't matter much
She's the New World Madonna with the golden touch
She filled a bull-ring--forty-five thousand seater
But if you're prettier than General Franco
That's not hard

Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
More important, current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset
Your trump card

Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is yes!

There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where we go
The whole world over--just the same
You should have heard them call our name
And who would underestimate the actress now?

I'm not underestimating you--just do the same thing in
Italy please

Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome is not so good
She hasn't gone down like we thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini
Can't think why

Did you here that?
They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!

But Signora Peron
It's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
yet I gave up the sea long ago

Things aren't all that bad she met with the Pope
She got a Papal decoration and a kindly word
So even if the crowds gave our lady the bird

The Argentine/Italy axis does have some hope
She still made a fabulous impact
Caught the eye

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is

A qualified

Yes!

Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like the sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the carefree days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired

Tired? Eva tired?

Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now

It wasn't on the schedule anyhow

You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home triumph
Is required

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
Would Evita win through?

And the answer is

Yes

And no

And yes

And no

And yes, and no
Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success

Who the hell does the King of England think he is?

If you strip away The myth from the man,
You will see where we all soon will be. Jesus!

You really do believe
This talk of God is true.

Will soon get swept away.

All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

And they'll crush us if we go too far.

What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"You ought to ask Mr. Mistoffelees
The original conjuring cat
The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mr. Mistoffelees's conjuring turn, presto

And you'll all say
""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees""

""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees""

He is quiet and small, he is black
From the ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail

He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always decieving you into believing
That he's only hunting for mice

He can play any trick with a cork
Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it was merely misplaced

You have seen it one moment
And then it is gone
But you find it next week
Lying out on the lawn

And you'll all say
""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees""

""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees""

His manner is vague and aloof
You would think there was nobody shyer
But his voice has been heard on the roof
When he was curled up by the fire

And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
When he was about on the roof
At least we all heard that somebody purred
Which is uncontestable proof

Of his singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call
Him in from the garden for hours
When he was asleep in the hall

And not long ago
This phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens
Right out of a hat

And we'll all say
""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees""

""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees""

""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical

""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical

""Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical

A cat so clever as magical

I give you the marvelous
Magical Mr. Mistoffelees, presto

",The Rum Tum Tugger,1983
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time:
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina...

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true",Don't cry for me Argentina [From Evita],1991
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Jesus

I only want to say
If there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed

I'm not as sure, as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years, seems like thirty
Could you ask as much from any other man?

But if I die
See the saga through and do the things you ask of me,
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me, nail me to their tree
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God

Why I should die
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done matter any more?
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
If I die what will be my reward?
If I die what will be my reward?
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord

Why should I die? Oh why should I die?
Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die
You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why

Alright, I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how I die!
Then I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
After all, I've tried for three years, seems like ninety
Why then am I scared to finish what I started
What you started, I didn't start it

God, thy will is hard
But you hold every card
I will drink your cup of poison
Nail me to your cross and break me
Bleed me, beat me
Kill me
Take me, now!
Before I change my mind",Gethsemane,1991
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"My mind is clearer now.
At last all too well
I can see where we all soon will be.
If you strip away The myth from the man,
You will see where we all soon will be. Jesus!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you.
You really do believe
This talk of God is true.
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say.

Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

I am frightened by the crowd.
For we are getting much too loud.
And they'll crush us if we go too far.
If they go too far

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.
All your followers are blind.
Too much heaven on their minds.
It was beautiful, but now it's sour.
Yes it's all gone sour.

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.

Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation

A most amazing man.
He had that look you very rarely find:
The haunting, hunted kind.
I asked him to say what had happened,
How it all began.
I asked again, he never said a word.
As if he hadn't heard.
And next, the room was full of wild and angry men.
They seemed to hate this man.
They fell on him, and then
Disappeared again.
Then I saw thousands of millions
Crying for this man.
And then I heard them mentioning my name,
And leaving me the blame.",Pilate's dream,1991

In pursuit of that wish which till now has been silent
Silent
I have brought you
That our passions may fuse and merge

Dropped all defenses, completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me, no second thoughts
You've decided, decided

Past the point of no return
No backward glances
The games we've played till now are at an end
Past all thought of if or when
No use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us
Past the point of no return
The final threshold?
What warm, unspoken secrets will we learn
Beyond the point of no return?

You have brought me
To that moment where words run dry
To that moment where speech disappears into silence
Silence
I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined our bodies entwining, defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you, no second thoughts
I've decided, decided

Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud bursts into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?

Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while
Please promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

Can it be
Can it be Christine
Bravo!
Long ago
It seems so long ago

My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories,
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye.",Wishing you were somehow here again,1991

Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us and
There's only one of him
The dreams of course will not come true
That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?

I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days

The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Heightens each sensation...

And stirs imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defences
Helpless to resist

Night unfurls its splendour.

Hearing is believing
Music is deceiving
Hard as lightning
Soft as candlelight
Dare you trust
The music of the night...

And the truth
Isn't what you want to see.

Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""

As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

To you we sigh, mourning and weeping

That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as I ought to have told you before
Is really Asparagus, but that's a fuss to pronounce

That we usually call him just Gus
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
For he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
But no longer a terror to mice or to rats

For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)

He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
For he once was a star of the highest degree
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree

And he likes to relate his success on the halls
Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
But his grandest creation as he loves to tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell


Sir John 
I have played in my time every possible part
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
I'd extemporize backchat, I knew how to gag

And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag
I knew how to act with my back and my tail
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts

Whether I took the lead, or in character parts
I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
In the pantomime season, I never fell flat

And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
But my grandest creation, as history will tell
was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

Sarah 
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
When some actor suggested the need for a cat

Sir John 
And I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
They never get drilled in a regular troupe
And they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop

Sarah 
And he says as he scratches himself with his claws

Sir John 
Well the theatre is certainly not what is was
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell

For that's the night that Peron first met Eva",The Lady's Got Potential,1997
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"(Eva:)
The choice was mine, and mine completely
I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time

Remember I was very young then
And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?
I saw the lights, and I was on my way

And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

(Che:)
The choice was yours and noone else's
You can cry for a body in despair
Hang your head because she is no longer there
To shine, to dazzle, or betray
How she lived, how she shone
But how soon the lights were gone

(Embalmers:)
Eyes, hair, face, image
All must be preserved
Still life displayed forever
No less than she deserved.",Lament,1997
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"(Peron:)
Dice are rolling, the knives are out
Would-be presidents are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground

(Eva:)
It doesn't matter what those morons say
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only twenty of them anyway
What is twenty next to millions who
Are looking to you?

All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll...you'll be handed power on a plate
When the ones who matter have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree to be called

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment, and that is why
All exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay

(Eva:)
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide, there's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be denied

(Eva:)
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems, he shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the workers' battle song
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Rings out loud and long

(Eva:)
Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me

(All:)
A new Argentina, a new age about to begin
A new Argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

(Eva:)
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the Big Apple

But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country

(Eva:)
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(All:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied

How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause
The inconvenience, having to get a majority
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause
There are other ways of establishing authority

People of Europe, I send you the Rainbow of Argentina
(Che:)
Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much
(Aide #1:)
She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
(Aide #2:)
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
(Che:)
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard
(Aide #1:)
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
(Aide #2:)
But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card
Chorus:
(Peron and Aides:)
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is yes
(Peron:)
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?
(Che:)
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why
(Eva:)
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!
(Italian admiral:)
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
(Aide #2:)
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
(Che:)
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
(Aide #1:)
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye
(chorus)
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is ...
(Che:) A qualified
(Aides:) Yes
(Che:)
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
(Che:)
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now
(Aide #1:)
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow
(Che:)
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required
(chorus)
(Aide #2:) Would Evita win through?
(Aide #1:) And the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) No

Make me special, be my angel

The last time they loved anyone at all?

She's not a bauble you can brush aside

Gave us back our businesses, got the English out

The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed

Well, one does one's best
Here's to us
The toast for the city
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here

Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you

Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast, faces

Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of gold, true is false
Who is who?

Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face?

Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you

What a night! What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the crème, de la crème

Watching us, watching them
All our fears are in the past
Three months of relief
Of delight, of Elysian peace

And we can breathe at last
No more notes, no more ghost
Here's a health, here's a toast
To a prosperous year

To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade

Think of it, a secret engagement
Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime

Christine, what are you afraid of?

His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare

But I tell you once and once again Macavity's not there!

Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunked in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!

He's outwardly respectable, I know he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted or the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place Macavity's not there!

And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations: the Napolean of crime!

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"High flying, adored
So young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
You were just a backstreet girl
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting

High flying, adored
Did you believe in your wildest moments
All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?

Were there stars in your eyes
When you crawled in at night
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall

High flying, adored
What happens now, where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you

High flying, adored
I hope you come to terms with boredom
So famous so easily, so soon
It's not the wisest thing to be

You won't care if they love you
It's been done before
You'll despair if they hate you
You'll be drained of all energy
All the young who've made it would agree

High flying, adored
That's good to hear but unimportant
My story's quite usual
Local girl makes good, weds famous man

Filled a gap, I was lucky
But one thing I'll say for me
No one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored,1999

In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin
You see the border of her coat is torn and stained with sand
And you see the corner of her eye twist like a crooked pin

She haunted many a low resort
Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the No Man's Land
From ""The Rising Sun"" to ""The Friend at Hand""
And the postman sighed as he scratched his head
""You'd really had thought she ought to be dead""

Way way back many centuries ago, not long after the Bible began
Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, a fine example of a family man
Jacob, Jacob and sons, depended on farming to earn their keep
Jacob, Jacob and sons, spent all of their days in the fields with sheep

Jacob was the founder of a whole new nation,
Thanks to the number of children he'd had
He was also known as Israel but most of the time
His sons and his wives used to call him dad
Jacob, Jacob and sons, men of the soil, of the sheaf and crook
Jacob, Jacob and sons, a remarkable family in anyone's book

Reuben was the eldest of the children of Israel,
With Simeon and Levi the next in line
Napthali and Isaachar with Asher and Dan,
Zebulun and Gad took the total to nine

Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through

came out of the Nile
And right behind them fine healthy animals came seven other cows,
skinny and vile
Well the thin cows ate the fat cows which I thought would do them good
But it didn't make them fatter like I thought a monster supper should
Because the thin ones were as thin as they had ever ever been

C'mon you know that kings ain't stupid
But I don't have a clue
So don't be cruel Joseph
You gotta help me now I beg of you

I was standing doing nothing in a field out of town I saw seven
beautiful ears of corn
They were ripe they were golden but you guessed it right
behind them were seven other ears  tattered and torn
Then the bad corn ate the good corn man they came up right behind
yes they did
And Joseph here's the punchline it's really gonna blow your mind 
flip your lid
Because the bad corn was as bad as it had ever ever been

Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo

Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?

Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
And mark your adieu with three cheers
But first tell me who'd be delighted

Jackpot boulevard
Once you've won, you have to go on winning

You think I've sold out
Damn right I've sold out
I've just been waiting 
For the right offer

Comfortable quarters
Regular rations
Twenty four hour
Five star room service

And if I'm honest
I like the lady
I can't help being
Touched by her folly

I'm treading water
Taking her money
Watching her sun set
Well I'm a writer

LA's changed a lot over the years
Since those brave goldrush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons
Far as they could go
End of the line

Their dreams were yours
Their dreams were mine
But in those dreams
Were hidden dragons

I threw a rope
Now I have suits
And she is hope
It seemed an elegant solution

One day this must end
It isn't real
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal
Before tomorrow's execution

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover,
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you,
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning,
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past,
This world's waited long enough,
I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger,
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye (from Sunset Boulevard),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange 
When I try to explain how I feel 
That I still need your love after all that I've done 
You won't believe me 

All you will see is a girl you once knew 
Although she's dressed up to the nines 
At sixes and sevens with you 
I had to let it happen, I had to change 

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel 
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom 
Running around trying everything new 

But nothing impressed me at all 
I never expected it to 
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you 

All through my wild days
My mad existence 
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance 

And as for fortune, and as for fame 
I never invited them in 
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired 
They are illusions 

They're not the solutions they promised to be 
The answer was here all the time 
I love you and hope you love me 
Don't cry for me Argentina...... 

Don't cry for me Argentina 
The truth is I never left you 
All through my wild days 
My mad existence 

I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance 
Have I said too much? There's nothing more I can think of to say to you 
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true",Don't Cry for Me Argentina (from Evita),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days, when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else

I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man. He's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more

Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so

I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope

I'd turn my head, I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so

I love him so",I Don't Know How to Love Him (from Jesus Christ Superstar),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Love, love changes everything 
Hands and faces, earth and sky 
Love, love changes everything 
How you live and how you die 
Love, can make the summer fly 
Or a night seem like a lifetime 
Yes love, love changes everything 
Now I tremble at your name 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 

Love, love changes everything 
Days are longer, words mean more 
Love, love changes everything 
Pain is deeper than before 
Love will turn your world around 
And that world will last forever 
Yes love, love changes everything 
Brings you glory, brings you shame 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 

Off into the world we go 
Planning futures, shaping years 
Love bursts in and suddenly all our wisdom disappears 
Love makes fools of everyone 
All the rules we made are broken 
Yes love, love changes everyone 
Live or perish in its flame 
Love will never never let you be the same 
Love will never never let you be the same",Love Changes Everything (from Aspects of Love),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory (from Cats),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Night time, sharpens, heightens each sensation,
Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination,
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses,

Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender,
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn you face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night (from Phantom of the Opera),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"[Chorus:]
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 

[Chorus]

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know, I know 
I know this love's forever 
That's all that matters now 
No matter what!",No Matter What (from Whistle Down the Wind),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina peron
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention
Unless we all are, I think we all are
So share my glory, so share my coffin
So share my glory, so share my coffin

It's our funeral too",Oh What a Circus (from Evita),2002
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Ring out the old
Bring in the new
A midnight wish to share with you
Your lips are warm, my head is light
Were we in love before tonight?

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

No need to hear the music play
Your eyes say all there is to say
The stars can fade
And they can shine
Long as your face is next to mine

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me

Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye

You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say.

Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

I am frightened by the crowd.
For we are getting much too loud.
And they'll crush us if we go too far.
If they go too far....

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.
All your followers are blind.
Too much heaven on their minds.
It was beautiful, but now it's sour.
Yes it's all gone sour.

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"At the watering holes of the well-to-do
I detect a resistance to
Precisely
Our heroine's style
We're glad you noticed

The shooting sticks of the upper-class
Give her an inch
Aren't supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl
She'll take a mile

Such a shame she wandered into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person has forced us to be blunt
No we wouldn't mind seeing her at Harrod's
But behind the jewelry counter, not in front

Could there be in our fighting corps
A lack of enthusiasm for
Peron's latest flame
You said it brother

Should you wish to cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess
Just mention her name

That isn't funny

Peron is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing a girl in the army H.Q.
And she's an actress, the last straw
Her only good parts are between her thighs
She should stare at the ceiling, not reach for the skies
Or she could be his last whore

The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her who's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Bitch! Dangerous Jade

We have allowed ourselves to slip
We have completely lost our grip
We have declined to an all-time low
Tarts have become the set to know

I am only a radio star with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people I want you to know
We are tired of the decline of Argentina
With no sign of a government able to give us the things we deserve

It's no crime for officers to do as they please
As long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the center where she's not qualified
We are forced to mark his card

She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud but to be laid
Slut! Dangerous Jade

This has really been your year, Miss Duarte
Tell us where you go from here, Miss Duarte
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?
Whom did you sleep, dine with yesterday?

Acting is limiting, the line's not mine
That's no help to the Argentine


Can we assume then that you'll quit?
Is this because of your involvement with Colonel Peron?

Goodnight and thank you

She won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
She says it's his body, but she's after his files
So get back on to the street

She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud but to be laid
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her who's using him
He's exceptionally dim

When someone pretty lower-class
Graceless and vulgar, uninspired
Can be accepted and admired",Peron's Latest Flame [From Evita],2004

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?

The phantom of the opera is there,

My power over you
Grows stronger yet

Draw back in fear

If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face

Masquerade, grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade, take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade, burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade, stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade, seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade, you can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade, leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade, run and hide, but a face will still pursue you

Makes you proud

Of delight, of elysian peace

To our friends who are here

And what a masquerade

But, why is it secret? what have we to hide

    (They clink glasses and move off RAOUL and 
CHRISTINE:
    emerge. She is admiring a new acquisition: an engagement ring from RAOUL, which she has attached to a gold chain around her neck.)

CHRISTINE:
    Think of it! A secret engagement! Look - your future bride! Just think of it!

RAOUL:
    But why is it secret? What have we to hide?

CHRISTINE:
    Please, let's not fight . . .

RAOUL:
    Christine, you're free!

CHRISTINE:
    Wait till the time is right . . .

    (Dance section, in which CHRISTINE, almost coquettish almost jittery, goes from man to man. But too many of her partners seem to be replicas of the PHANTOM, and each spins her with increasing force. Eventually RAOUL rescues her and holds her tightly. He whirls her back into the dance, as the music heads towards its climax.)

    (At the height of the activity a grotesque figure suddenly appears at the lop of the staircase. Dressed all in crimson, with a death's head visible inside the hood of his robe, the PHANTOM has come to the party. With dreadful wooden steps he descends the stairs and takes the centre of the stage)",Masquerade [DVD],2005
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned.
Why'd you choose such a backward time in such a strange land?
If you'd come today you could have reached a whole nation.
Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication.
Don't you get me wrong.
I only want to know.

Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?
Jesus Christ Superstar,
Do you think you're what they say you are?

Tell me what you think about your friends at the top.
Who'd you think besides yourself's the pick of the crop?
Buddha, was he where it's at? Is he where you are?
Could Mohammed move a mountain, or was that just PR?
Did you mean to die like that? Was that a mistake, or
Did you know your messy death would be a record breaker?
Don't you get me wrong.
I only want to know.

Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?

Do you think you're what they say you are?

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begun","Memory, song (for the musical Cats)",2006
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"There again I've more to do
Than simply get the message through

I came from the people, they need to adore me
So Christian Dior me from my head to my toes
I need to be dazzling, I want to be rainbow high
They must have excitement, and so must I

I won't disappoint them
I'm their savior, that's what they call me
So Lauren Bacall me, anything goes
To make me fantastic, I have to be rainbow high
In magical colors

You're not decorating a girl for a night on the town
And I'm not a second-rate queen getting kicks with a crown

Next stop will be Europe
The rainbow's gonna tour, dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show

And they do

Well maybe not that fine

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true","Don't Cry for Me Argentina, song (for the musical Evita)",2006
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"The heart is slow to learn
The heart is slow to learn
These feelings that I feel
Are foolish but their real
I'm wise enough to see this love will never be
I'd try to let us know there's still no letting go
I know it's mad and you won't return
But still as I have said
The heart is slow to learn
I'll never love as I have loved you
Why is love cruel I wish I knew
Say what you will it doesn't matter
Until I die there's only you
Until I die there's only you
The heart is slow to learn

The heart is slow to learn
You'd think there would be a way
To shut out yesterday
Perhaps if I just thought
Of all the times we fought
I'd try to let us know there's still no letting go
I know it's mad and you won't return
But then as I have said the heat is slow to learn
I'll never love as I have loved you
Why is love cruel I wish I knew
Say what you will it doesn't matter
Until I die there's only you
Until I die there's only you

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way your way in darkness

Who will be there for you?
Comfort and care for you?
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion

Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you
You've always known
Your heart was on its own

So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone

Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night","The Music of the Night, song (for the musical The Phantom of the Opera)",2006

Next year will be the perfect year

No need to hear the music play
Your eyes say all there is to say
The stars can fade
And they can shine
Long as your face is next to mine

Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

We don't need a crowded ballroom

You're gonna show me that you already know
There's a feast waiting for you
And you've never even gotten a taste
It's later than you think and

You shouldn't tremble when we touch
There's no reason for these fears

We've been promised this for years
I wanna show you it all
What to do and where and how
Cause we'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never be as young as we are right now

So many cries in the night
That you try to ignore
Why didn't I do this?
Why didn't I do that?
So many unanswered prayers
So many unopened doors
