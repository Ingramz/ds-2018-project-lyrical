Count Basie Orchestra,"I got the blues
I feel so lonely
I'd give the world if I could only make you understand
Yes, it surely would be grand
I'm simply wild about my baby
Ask her won't she please come home
Since she's gone, I stay worried all the time
So, baby, won't you, please, come home?
You know your daddy's all alone
I have tried but all in vain
Never no more to call your name
Since you left, you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you, please, come home to your daddy?

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you

And high above

Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon

Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face

I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

With cigarettes and songs

But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something

With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song

A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like

But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,

But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""

But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.

But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Stay tuned for a while

Because I live like an animal
Our homeplace was terrible
I was a kid so I tried to live with it
Same kid was a weak individual
But I was not, I was so strong
And so the music helped me get along
Take a look at me now, cause here I am
I'm your mate, man

Dil is the one they drop in the stroller

Cuz Dil cried to sleep cuz his eyes are beat
And as soon as they bring Chucky to petro
Chucky gets scared, Chucky says let's go

Me and my twin woulda finished like Phil and Lil

Where we going this adventure, who you wanna come with
See and you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it gotta be done quick

Do you still remember, how we used to be
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave you
We'd only just begun
Hasta mañana, always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Yes I still remember, every whispered word
The touch of your skin, giving life from within
Like a love song that I'd heard
Slippin' through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
Has reflections in my mind
Hasta mañana, always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold

I treated you bad

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love evryday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Hold on to your love

Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on

And it seems that most are still content.
Where most are comfortable accepting insignificance
we strive to find the effort within

I think i’ve finally identified the difference
I think I live in both my hell and my home
I will forever be a slave to your distance
Don’t let me in
Don’t let me go

Carry me back to your bed
My conscience is my coffin and I swear sometimes i’d rather be dead
Make sure that I still feel, I don’t care how much it hurts
I’ll always be numb on my side of the earth
Don’t let me in, don’t let me go

(in this moment)
I’d rather die than live without you
I’d rather die",Solace,
Counterparts,"A calm rushes over me
As I picture my corpse Ill-fated with the faults I can’t escape
(A sigh of relief)
A sigh of relief used to signify the blight
That infects the last few fragments of my skull

Sometimes I swear I think that I’ll be fine
I’ve made up my mind
Death is my birthright
I am a noose waiting to be tied

Still I try to elude the truth and embrace my disguise
Because this way of life takes its toll on mine
And I don’t want to be alive

Bury me breathing so I can watch myself decay
Bury me breathing so I can watch myself decay
So I can watch myself decay

We are stillborns by definition
But our pulse-infected wrists will disagree
We burden ourselves with intent and ambition
When we’ve accepted that all hope is lost
So dance past my lips and disperse
Leaving no trace of human condition
Our bodies blind the world with a sense of selflessness
That only a trained eye can see
You blame me for your blindness
Open your eyes
You blame me for your blindness
Open your eyes",Stillborn,
Counterparts,"Your ghost holds me close
As I’m ravaged by the solitary that surrounds my former home
Use me until you’ve spent the rest of my remains
And then try to validate your actions
Cursing every empty vein
That used to be inhabited by your impression

Paralyze me
To ensure I have no chance of knowing the feeling of affection
It’s no secret that I’ve shed the common decency
That appoints the world with the burden of devotion to our kin
I gave you everything I had and the world has left me exhausted

(So make me feel)
So make me feel something
Anything that might change my mind
As worthless as I am, I know that I still serve a purpose
To leech off the light and absolve my insignificance

Lay me to rest
Lay me to rest inside of a glass casket
So you can remember me with a smile on my face
Adorning me in my own failures
So you can count them as you stand above my bones

I wish I were a better man
I am a coward masked in courage
And just admitting this will not save me this time
So free me from my tired mind
And let me learn the difference
Between a single tear and the runoff of an ocean
Weak and weary from my predatory nature
So bless me with abandonment in my greatest time of need

Let me carry on knowing that I could never truly face my reflection
It’s much easier to caress the broken glass (broken glass)
Though if I accidentally catch a glimpse of myself in the shards
I will put my faith in the shrapnel to correct my vision

I am a stranger when I stare into the eyes of those I love
Look away in disgust
Protect yourself from the sight of my deception

Counterparts,"Your words grow cold and incoherent
And I’m searching for a fever
That could lift me to the border of dementia
My eyes are tired from surveying everything we used to share
And I would sew them shut if I had any strength inside
I remember every promise
I’ve carved them into my spine

I raise my hands to the sky and beg that this won’t go unnoticed
Though I know some fires are not meant to burn

We are bred to flicker and fade, not to retreat into the earth
Not to grow without remorse
We douse ourselves with the moisture
That we’ve drawn from the soil
We breed and unleash
We’re our own natural disaster
String me along like the thread that binds your ribcage
Tie my limbs to the anchor, and be sure that I’m left alone to sink

I will shine brighter than the sun
I will forever be your torch
Cast me away
And in time I will set fire to the fibers that connect us

My palms grow calloused from the cold
I need your touch to cauterize
Sustained by the flame of another
The embers begin to reignite

There’s a hole in the heart that will never be filled
The anguish will fall through your fingers
Respect can manifest itself through misfortune
I am alone, and the world carries on
I am alone
The world carries on and we don’t deserve a second thought",Thread,2015
Counterparts,"Take comfort in the cadence of the bond we share
A visionary born and raised to see with an unbiased sense of sight
We pause just for a second to properly embrace the radiance
We are the anointed dipped in filth
Taught to cower in fear of being identified
But tragedy will find us

I’m held captive by my spoiled soul
I won’t allow it to affect my stride
The procession will proceed as we’re gifted with our own idea of peace

So find yourself in me
I promise I will keep you as we harvest the passion that remains
Make my skin your sanctuary

I make a pact with the earth to draw life from the living
Make my skin your sanctuary
Leap to the beat of my blood
So place your hand in mine, drag your feet across the tops of trees
Breathe easy knowing that the branches will support you
And the weight of your complication

In the midst of the ruin that surrounds us
We communicate but only in tongues
Our lips will welcome the caress of the crucifixion
And we stain the wood with defeat

I am not a mortal, I am a metaphor for moving forward",Tragedy,2015
Counterparts,"I bask in familiar flesh with no shelter to call my own
A sacrifice for my sickness, I’ll dig a grave for those I love
I release the teeth from my jaw
Knowing that I will miss the pain when you take shelter in the mouth of another
You live in the back of my throat
Spawning sentences in unison with mine

Stay safe in my breath, you will never be lost
If our attraction is only skin deep, how deep is deep enough?

I’ve made a habit out of grinding my bones into a sharper point when I hear your name...
And I’ve named each cut you’ve cursed me with
Though I wish I had the courage to ask for more
Your spirit suffocates me
You won’t find asylum inside
I never asked for your blood in my veins
So haunt me not and disappear
I am a victim, despite what you’ve heard
Forced to dwell inside of endless withdrawal
We can never coexist, so I will offer up my heart
Don’t look back and try to find me
I was always doomed to watch you from the dark

Stay safe in my breath, you will never be lost
If our attraction is only skin deep, how deep is deep enough?",Withdrawal,2015

Counting Crows,"In the still water she lies down
Shaking through the press of sunlight
We rolled into Lexington
She shakes off the drop of daylight
Water beading up her chest
Bleeding down between her knees
Rivers in Kentucky flow
Between the bluegrass wavy seas
But oh, Margery
Twists the knife once more inside of me
Breathless with anticipation
Baited reelers set their hooks
Tuck their heads beneath the high grass
And lie and wait beside the brooks
We're infants pushing slowly through
Frustration leading back along
The alleys of a childhood
That will not release us willingly
But oh, Margery ..sticks the knife in while I couldn't see (strait into me baby)
Dust me off and shut me down
And dream of where I haven't been
Close the door inside my heart
Stuck in the south Atlantic wind
I have hollow eyes
Haunting only to myself
Even so, I can't stop calling
These great big hollows in myself
I took the train from California
To the far side of the continent
Woke up in Kentucky
Where a wedding was about to end
I looked up at Anna
She turned back to look at me
It's best to kill the ones that matter
Render blind the ones who see
But oh, Margery
Takes the blade and walks away from me
Oh, Margery
Love like blood is pouring out of me
Oh, Margery

The big top is crumbling down
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
Where you should be, no one's around

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I need a big love
I need a phone call

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat

And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you
I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train
If I listen real hard
And I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar
I think it's time to put the top down

My friend implores me: ""For one time only make an exception""
I am not not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
With the status of my emotions ""Oh"", She says, ""You're changing.""

But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean

But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned

I am not worried
""If it's love"", she said, ""then were gonna have to think about the
consequences""
She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days"" she says

But I'm not gonna break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
It seems like I should say ""as long as this is love...""
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just:
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...

The time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing

It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away

Counting Crows,"Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.

And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

I walk in the air between the rain,
Through myself and back again.
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying.
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here we always stand up straight
'Round here something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house, takes her clothes off,
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here we're carving out our names
'Round here we all look the same
'Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here she's slipping through my hands

Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head.""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head.""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling.""

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping.
She says she's tired of life;
She must be tired of something.

'Round here she's always on my mind
'Round here (hey man) I got lots of time
'Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very very very very late

I can't see nothing, nothing
Around here
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me because I'm falling down on here
I said "" I'm under the gun""
'Round here.
Oh man I said ""I'm under the gun""
'Round here.
And I can't see nothin', nothin'.

And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls

Can you see her? Because I'm almost there
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me?

Be a different kind if you thought you could

Close your eyes and she ascends
Hold your breath and ease your mind

Feathers falling through the night

When the weather bothers me
I empty drawers of other summers

As her smile begins to curl
In this or any other summer
She is something altogether different
Never just an ordinary girl

And in the evenings on Long Island
When the colors start to fade
She wears a silly yellow hat
That someone gave her when she stayed
I didn't think that she returned it

When you are spinning in the grip of someone
Who is not an ordinary girl

But she stays just out of sight
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
And when you wake the morning covers you with light
And it makes you feel alright
But it's just the same hard candy you're
remembering again

You send your lover off to China
And you wait for her to call
You put your girl up on a pedestal
Then you wait for her to fall
I put my summers back in a letter
And I hide it from the world
All the regrets you can't forget
Are somehow pressed upon a picture
In the face of such an ordinary girl

And when you sleep you find your mother in the night
But she fades just out of sight

I wish that I knew what I know now

It will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
All them dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
For they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find, yeah
You're just a boy again

He said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
And if you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars

You'll have to learn it just like me

'Cause I'm awake in my room
I've been up for 38 hours
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon

'Cause I could break like a bird
Or I could swallow the sea
It seems like the daylight is coming
And no one is watching but me

But I don't mind the dark
Discovering the day
'Cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and gray

What brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough
And what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough of love

And it's a dangerous time
For a heart on a wire
Shuttle from station to station
Noisily not knowing why

So I put my head on the ground
And the sky is a wheel
Spinning these days into things that I've lost
But you can keep all the years

But I don't mind the days
Gone rolling away
'Cause all this sunlight feels warm on my face today

But what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough
And what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough, never get enough
Never get enough, no no, never get enough, no oh no
And still I can never get enough of love

And what brings me, brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough of love
I can never get enough of love

I got a little further today
Wash your eyes clear of anything
Make them empty circles
Dress yourself in black or Grey
I'm hungry like a wild waif or only child
This lithium is heroin to me

It makes it all withdraw
All the anger and loss
But it all keeps coming back in the morning

You dig yourself a dream

And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
So I headed west to grow up with the country
Out across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil,
And I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge,
Last night at half past two
The switch man waved his lantern goodbye
And so long as we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something
That I've never been shown
And I saw my devil,
And I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt
And lit out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true

Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight
On the way back down, finally a sequel,
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight

Is it alright, and your exit's always an unknown
It's hard to hold on too tight, 'cause I got buried with your bones
And I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest
All your reason gone tonight, you don't have to solve for X

Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping
Wide awake, there's some pills that I shouldn't take

And I said alright, X is always an unknown
I tried to hold on too tight but I got buried with the bone
And I said honest to God, I got to get it off my chest

Explode against a black fist
He falls to the floor
He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why
But he can’t go back there no more

Future sounds so crazy
We’ve all heard that song before
Tomorrow’s the name we change from yesterday to blame
When the train just don’t stop here anymore

I got starry-eyed on the coaster ride
Andy says “Man, I need a break from the world outside
These days my life just careens through a pinball machine
I could do so much better but I can’t get off the TILT”

There’s a photograph on the TV
Black and white and 
Andy says something to you 
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like 
She says “I forget myself sometimes too”

Out past the doorways where we are sleeping
The White Queens creep and the tomcats peep

And now I’m not breaking
The train’s just shaking
And I’ve never made it here before
There’s a Wild Mouse spinning the girls around
Til they can’t take it anymore
I used to dream in the dark of Palisades Park
Up over the cliffs and down among the sparks
It’s a long life full of long nights
But it’s not what I was waiting for
Everybody’s seen the horses diving down the shore
It’s a miracle they don’t make them anymore

So…”Make up ladies”…Wake up baby

You walked into the bar like some Saturday star
Stud-straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves
You’re a downtown pride fully-amplified Clyde
Gin-tight and aging but well-preserved

Remember Andy standing outside your bedroom window
Saying “Come on, let’s drive across to the Palisades
Keep going til we hit Reno, Nevada”
Don’t see Andy all that much these days

Still there are pages in back of the Action stacks
Where the White Queens creep and the tomcats peep

And the train’s not braking
The track’s just shaking
And I never made it here before
There’s a Sky Rocket turning the world around
Til I can’t take it anymore
You can carry that spark from Palisades Park
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark
It’s a long life full of long nights
And it’s not what I was looking for
Everybody dreams of horses flying ‘round the shore
It’s a bad dream we’re not having anymore

Man, have you seen Andy?
Hey man, have you seen her around?
Hey man, have you seen my my my Andy?
Hey man, have you seen her?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen her?
You seen Andy around?

Dressed up in our pirate best
All leathers and feathers and pearls
Andy said “Look at me man!
I am cookin’
These hands could finger up this whole world!”

He says “Come outside
Climb out your bedroom window
Shimmy down the fire escape
And say goodbye”

Come outside
Andy says “I’m dressed up just like Edie
Changing all the time
These leopard spots to polka dots
And say goodbye”

Come outside
Maybe we could move to California
Just meet me at the subway
And say goodbye

Come outside
The cops all think we’re crazy
But if you stay, you’ll just get married 
To a girl who’ll never know you
And then say goodbye

Hey Man, have you seen Andy?  
I lost her in the sun
I was high as a kite on Lovely & White
Man, you could lose anyone

Hey man, have you seen Andy
I don’t know where he’s gone
Real love outlives teenage lust
We could get wet and it keeps us warm

Love is like Angel Dust
Lovely sometimes changes us…sometimes not
Have you been aching to trust or just…?
Have you been waking yourself with lust…?
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?

It’s a long wait at a long light
Cars frozen in flight
All the traffic stops to stare

At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada
Wearing nothing but air
And a pair of grey paper wings 
Andy thinks “I got nothing to wear”

We got nothing to wear…
We got nothing to wear…
We got nothing to wear…",Palisades Park,2014
Counting Crows,"Colorado passes by like writing on a wall
Headed Eastward down to New Orleans
Dipping into Texas as the stars are fading out
But there’s still a lot of country in-between
When I left California, I was 29 years old
And the world just spun me ‘round
Now I just watch Louisiana
Scroll across the windowpane
And I face in the direction I am bound
 
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Make the waters come and wash me away
 
Me, Clifton and the King of Cats sat down in the road
Pedro said “Boys, we’re three of a kind”
He said “I’ve sat with river rats
And I’ve hung my hat with diplomats
I had 4 brothers once upon a time”
He said they toured the country far away from the Rio Grande
But the road just wore them down
So they bought a house beside a lake outside of New Orleans
And they stared in the direction of the escalating sound
 
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Take this good man’s son and wash him away
 
Sister Indecipherable is talking to a wall
Back in New York City, she’s a queen
Resurrect or genuflect
She saves the ones she can’t protect
And keeps the chapel pris- (if not Sis-) tine
She drinks Absinthe mixed with kerosene
To keep herself upright
But the world still brings her down
If you can’t keep your shit together when God is on your side
What chance do you have when he’s not around?
 
Cover up the sun
Make that water run
Let the river come to wash me away
 
People of the Mardi Gras in their Tuesday best
Waiting for the South to rise again
Children of Geronimo grieving for The West
Feather-dressed and marching the refrain
In the dark of Armstrong Park
The marching bands attend
But they never make a sound
Just a quiet prayer for Congo Square
A silent conversation there
With the night to rest our eyes in
We just look to the horizon for a change
 
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Pray the waters come to wash me away

But less than I need”

And we went from zero to everything all in a day
And then Kennedy took you away
 
I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm
And the moments that make up your life until you wake up
You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl
And she tells you she wanted to kiss you
And you know the worst part of a good day
Is hearing yourself say goodbye to one more possibility day
It goes on and on
 
I go west but your weather has changed
You’re just scared 
I mistake it for strange
When you want me to leave then you start to believe I should stay

Cause you just don’t sleep in the daylight so I don’t sit up nights

It seems like a good thing so you know it’s a good lie
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head when you’re lying in bed

And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it’s okay
The color of everything changes
The sky rearranges its’ shade and your smile doesn’t fade
Into a phone call and one bad decision we made

And the worst part of a good day is the one thing you don’t say
And you don’t know how but you wish there was some way
So you pull down the shades and you shut off the lights
Because somehow we mixed up “Goodbye” and “Goodnight”

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife

And promises and deeds undone

A story I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd the outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.

It was in the town of Shawnee,
It was a Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in the wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
And his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timbers
And he lived a life of shame,
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

Yes he took to the trees and timbers
On that Canadian River's shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At many a farmer's door.

There's many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little home.

Mothers tell you 'bout a stranger
That came to beg a meal
And underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

Now as through the world I ramble
I see lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
Some with a fountain pen.

But as through life you travel,
Yes, as through life you roam,
You'll never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd,1969
Country Joe McDonald,"Back in nineteen twenty seven
I had a little farm, I called that Heaven.
The prices up and the rain come down
And I hauled my crops all into town,
I got the money
Bought clothes and groceries
Fed the kids and raised a big family.

But the rain quit and the wind got high
A black old dust storm filled the sky.
I traded my farm for a Ford machine
Poured it full of this gasoline
Started rocking and rolling
Deserts and mountains to California.

Way up yonder on a mountain road
Hot motor and a heavy load
Going pretty fast I wasn't even stopping
Bouncing up and down like popcorn popping
I had a breakdown ?
Kind of a nervous bustdown.
The mechanic fellow there charged me five bucks,
Said it was engine trouble.

Way up yonder on a mountain curve
Way up yonder in the piney wood
I gave that rolling Ford a shove
And I coast as far as I could
Commencing rolling
Picking up speed
Come a hairpin turn and
I didn't make it.

No man alive I'm telling you
That the fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
And it flew halfway around the world
Scattered the wives and children
All over the side of that mountain.

Got to California so dad gum broke
Dad gum hungry that I thought I'd choke.
I bummed up a spud or two
And a wife fixed up some 'tater stew.
We poured the kids full of it
Mighty skinny kids
Looked like a tribe of thermometers running around.

No man I swear to you
That was surely mighty thin stew
So damn thin I really mean
You could read a magazine right through it
Look at the pictures, too
Pretty whisky bottles and naked women.
Always have thought and always have figured
That if that damn stew had been just a little bit thinner
Some of these here politicians could have seen through it.",Talkin' Dust Bowl,1969

'Twas there that he got his parole
After four long years on a man killing charge
Tom Joad came a-walking down the road, poor boy,
Tom Joad came a-walking down the road.

It was there that he found him a truck driving man,
It was there that he caught him a ride.
He said, ""I just got loose from McAlester pen
On a charge called homicide, great God,
A charge called homicide."" 

The truck rolled away in a big cloud of dust
And Tommy turned his face towards home.
He met Preacher Casey and they had a little drink
And he found out his family they was gone, Tom Joad,
He found out his family they was gone.

He found his mother's old-fashioned shoes
He found his daddy's hat
He found little Muley and little Muley said,
""They've been tractored out by the cats, Tom,
They've been tractored out by the cats."" 

Then Tom he walked to the neighboring farm,
He found his family.
They took Preacher Casey and they loaded in the car
And his mama said, ""We got to get away, Tom.""
His mama said, ""We got to get away"".

The twelve of the Joads made a mighty heavy load
And grandpa Joad, he cried.
He picked up a handful of land in his hand,
He said, ""I'm sticking with my farm until I die.""
He said, ""I'm sticking with my farm until I die."" 

They fed him spare ribs and coffee and soothing syrup
And grandpa Joad, he died.
We buried grandpa Joad on the Oklahoma road
And grandma on the California side
And grandma on the California side.

We stood on a mountain and we looked to the West,
It looked like the Promised Land.
Was a big green valley with a river running through
And there was work for every single hand, we thought,
Work for every single hand.

The Joads rolled in to the Jungle Camp,
It was there that they cooked them a stew
And the hungry little kids in the Jungle Camp
Said, ""We'd like to have some, too,
Yes, we'd like to have some, too."" 

A deputy sheriff fired loose at a man,
He shot a woman in the back,
But before he could take his aim again
It was Preacher Casey dropped him in his tracks,
Good boy, Preacher Casey dropped him in his tracks.

Well, they handcuffed Casey and they took him to jail
And then he got away.
He met Tom Joad by the old river bridge
And these few words he did say, Preacher Casey,
These few words he did say: 

""Well, I preached for the Lord a mighty long time,
I preached about the rich and the poor,
But us workin' folks has got to stick together
Or we ain't got a chance anymore, God knows,
We ain't got a chance anymore."" 

Then the deputies come and Tom and Casey run
To the place where the water run down
And the vigilante bug hit Casey with a club
And he laid Preacher Casey on the ground
And he laid Preacher Casey on the ground.

Tom Joad he grabbed the deputy's club,
He banged it down on his head
When Tommy took flight in that dark and rainy night
Was a preacher and a deputy lying dead, two men,
A preacher and a deputy lying dead.

Tommy went back to where his mama was asleep,
He woke her up out of bed.
He kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved
And he said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad,
He said what Preacher Casey said.

It looks that-a way to me
So everywhere you look in the day or night

That's where I'm gonna be.

As I stand exposed, my feelings are felt
And I cry into the echo of my loneliness.

Reminds me over and over of lies
And promises and deeds undone

Shall kill to live again and again
To clutch the throat of sweet revenge
For life is here only for the taking.

Country Joe McDonald,"It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands has hoed
My poor feet has traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your dustbowl and westward we rode
And your deserts was hot and your mountains was cold.

I slept on the ground in the light of the moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind.

Well it's up north to Oregon to gather your hops,
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine.

From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in this Union us migrants has been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win.

All along your green valley I will work until I die.

Courtney Barnett,"I sleep in late
Another day
Oh what a wonder
Oh what a waste.
It’s a Monday
It’s so mundane
What exciting things
Will happen today?
The yard is full of hard rubbish it’s a mess and
I guess the neighbors must think we run a meth lab
We should amend that
I pull the sheets back
It’s 40 degrees
And i feel like I'm dying.
Life’s getting hard in here
So i do some gardening
Anything to take my mind away from where it’s supposed to be.
The nice lady next door talks of green beds
And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps.
Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes.
I feel pro-active
I pull out weeds
All of a sudden
I’m having trouble breathing in.
I’m having trouble breathing in.
I’m having trouble breathing in.
I’m having trouble breathing in.

My hands are shaky
My knees are weak
I can’t seem to stand
On my own two feet
I’m breathing but I'm wheezing
Feel like I'm emphysemin’
My throat feels like a funnel
Filled with weet bix and kerosene and
Oh no, next thing i know
They call up triple o
I’d rather die than owe the hospital
Till I get old
I get adrenalin
Straight to the heart
I feel like Uma Thurman
Post-overdosing kick start
Reminds me of the time
When i was really sick and i
Had too much psuedoefedryn and i
Couldn’t sleep at night
Halfway down high street, Andy looks ambivalent
He’s probably wondering what i’m doing getting in an ambulance
The paramedic thinks I'm clever cos i play guitar
I think she’s clever cos she stops people dying
Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic
Should’ve stayed in bed today
I much prefer the mundane.
I take a hit from
An asthma puffer
I do it wrong
I was never good at smoking bongs.
I’m not that good at breathing in.
I’m not that good at breathing in.
I’m not that good at breathing in.",Avant Gardener,2013
Courtney Barnett,"I got drunk and fell asleep
Atop the sheets but luckily
I left the heater on

And in my dreams I wrote the best
Song that I’ve ever written
Can’t remember how it goes

I stayed drunk and fell awake
I was cycling on a plane
And far away I heard you say you liked me

We drifted to a party, cool
The people went to arty school
They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

[Chorus]
In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name

I found an Ezra Pound
And made a bet that if I found
A cigarette, I’d drop it all and marry you

Just then a song comes on:
""You can’t always get what you want""
The Rolling Stones, oh woe is we, the irony

The stones became the moss
And once all inhibition's lost
The hipsters made a mission to the farm

We drove by tractor there
The yellow straw replaced our hair
We laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name


You said, ""We only live once""
So we touched a little tongue
And instantly I wanted to

I lost my train of thought
And jumped aboard the Epping as
The doors were slowly closing on the world

I touched on and off
And rubbed my arm up against yours
And still the inspector inspected me

The lady in the roof
Was living proof that nothing
Really ever is exactly as it seems

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name


We caught the river boat downstream
And ended up beside a team
Of angry footballers

I fed the ducks some krill
Then we were sucked against our will
Into the welcome doors of the casino

We drank green margaritas
Danced with sweet senoritas
And we all went home as winners of a kind

You said ""I guarantee we'll have more fun
Drink till the moon becomes the sun
And in the taxi home I’ll sing you a Triffids song""

I re-arrange
The letters on the page

Courtney Barnett,"I saw you in the lane next to me
You were doing freestyle, then you switched it around
To a little bit of backstroke
I couldn't see underneath
Your swimming cap, but it appeared that you had
Dark colored hair, maybe it was blonde for all I know
I had goggles on
They were getting foggy
I much prefer swimming to jogging

I tried my very best to impress you
Held my breath longer than I normally do
I was getting dizzy
My hair was wet and frizzy
Felt my muscles burn, I took a tumble turn

And I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first
A little pesticide can't hurt

If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you

Heading down the Highway Hume
Somewhere at the end of June
Taxidermied kangaroos are littered on the shoulders
A possum Jackson Pollock is painted in the tar
Sometimes I think a single sneeze could be the end of us
My hay-fever is turning up, just swerved into a passing truck
Big business overtaking
Without indicating
He passes on the right, been driving through the night
To bring us the best price

If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you

More people die on the road than they do in the ocean
Maybe we should mull over culling cars instead of sharks
Or just lock them up in parks where we can go and view them
There's a bypass over Holbrook now
Paid for with burgers no doubt
I've lost count of all the cows
There'll be no salad sandwiches
The law of averages says we'll stop in the next town
Where petrol price is down

Hey Debbie-Downer turn that frown upside down and just be happy

I don't ask too much of you
It's true and I can't read your mind

Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments

I'm growing older every time I blink my eyes
Boring, neurotic, everything that I despise
We had some lows, we had some mids, we had some highs

If that's the kind of person that I wanna be
If I'm not happy I'll be glad I kept receipts

Counting all the cracks backwards in my best French
Reminds me of a book I skim-read in a surgery
All about palmistry, I wonder what's in store for me
I pretend the plaster is the skin on my palms
And the cracks are representative of what is going on
I lose a breath, my love-line seems intertwined with death

I'm thinking of you too

I lay awake at three, staring at the ceiling
It's a kind of off-white, maybe it's a cream
There's oily residue zipping from the kitchen
It's art-deco necromantic chic, all the dinner plates are kitsch with
Irish Wolf Hounds, French baguettes wrapped loose around their necks

I see a dead seal on the beach
The old man says he's already saved it three times this week
Guess it just wants to die
I would wanna die too
With people putting oil into my air
But to be fair, I've done my share
Guess everybody's got their different point of view

I was walking down Sunset Strip, Phillip Island, not Los Angeles
Got me some hot chips and a cold drink
Took a sandy seat on the shore
There's a paper on the ground, it makes my headache quite profound
As I read it out aloud
It said, The Great Barrier Reef it ain't so great anymore
It's been raped beyond belief, the dredgers treat it like a whore

That I'm thankful for this view

Feeling sick at the sight of his computer
He dodges his way through the Swanston commuters
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man

He waits for an elevator, one to nine

Her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin
Hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton
Vickers perfume on her breath
A tortoise shell necklace between her breasts

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

Every strong and steady man
Open heart and open hands
One I think about each time
It makes me close my eyes and smile

Like a best friend or a savior
One who is on his best behavior
Firecracker, troublemaker
You know who you are

Every rider on the waves
Every rockstar I have saved
Every boy who loves his girl
Every person in the world

I'm in love

Courtney Jaye,"On this lonely stretch of solitude
I'm thinking 'bout the things that I never do
All the promises that I made to you
Well, they're just words, they're only words

It took so long for me to recognize
All this confidence that I couldn't find
I used to dim my light, so you could shine
And that's what hurts, it really hurts

I wanna do everything right
But everything's going wrong
I wanna feel heaven on earth
But nothing ever lasts that long

Baby, I'm goin' mental
So much potential
I can't stand to watch it withering away

It's out of control now
It's getting old now
And I can't afford to waste another day

Well, dust keeps piling up on the window sill
Man, if you don't know by now, I guess you never will
But there's no benefit in standing still
Not for you, no, no, and not for me

But I wanna make everything work
Something's just gotta give
I gotta start putting me first
It's killing me the way it is

Baby, I'm goin' mental
So much potential
I can't stand to watch it withering away

It's out of control now
It's getting old now
And I can't afford to waste another day

I wanna do everything right
But everything's going wrong
I wanna feel heaven on earth
And nothing ever lasts that long

Baby, I'm goin' mental
So much potential
I can't stand to watch it withering away

It's out of control now
It's getting old now
And I can't afford to waste another day

Courtney Jaye,"I complicate whichever way I try to go
I get in the way

I talk about it but I'm not complaining
The clouds look like rain
But it's not raining

[Chorus]
Darling I want you to see it's permanent
Changes are waking in me it's different
I will not self destruct
And I do not need to destroy us

In my head I've gone back and forth

Courtney Jaye,"There's still a little sand inside of my shoes
I leave it there to keep me close to you
There's a whole other world inside me now
Full of words you can't hear
But the power of how I really feel
Is pulling you near

Its a vibration
There's no separation
We're one and the same
I don't have to be afraid
If you feel it
You might as well reveal it
Cause this is the day
Tomorrow could all be taken away

I can see the sun without the sky
But I can't see myself without your eyes
I wish I had told you this back then
I thought I had time
Well there's no use in swimming in regrets
I'll leave them behind

[Chorus]

Suddenly waves cover me
Graced from above
So heavenly wrapped
Under the weight of your love
And you show me what you are made of

Cause the power of how I really feel
Is pulling you near

Its a vibration
There's no separation
We're one and the same
I don't have to be afraid
If you feel it
You might as well reveal it
Cause this is the day
And I'm gonna ride the wave

This vibration
Without hesitation
This is the day
This is the day
If you feel it
You might as well reveal it
Cause this is the day
Tomorrow could all be taken away

Courtney Jaye,"Three years or a lifetime
Three words that just might have come too soon
Three hours from somewhere
I might have ended up with you

Hold me like a river
Hold me like a string tied to a balloon
You get what you're given
At any moment a moment of truth

[Chorus]
All my life I'm traveling light
Been living in a sky
I'll float I'll fade I'll carry away
Til you pull me down and think of me sometimes

I'm sorry for leaving
I'm sorry for all I could not do
You knew it was coming
Maybe in some ways I did too

What is this journey?
And where does time go so slowly?
And how can we help but be who we are?
And change can end too much?
Love may be the end of us, but why, why should we fear?
Because with all the wondering, I?m weightless here in my dreams.
What is this someday?
What is it really?
But a tomorrow or today?
And frozen in the footsteps untaken, we stand side by side
Love may be the end of us, but why should we fear?
Because with all the wondering, I?m weightless here in my dreams
Take me into morning gently
And hand me off into the day
Suddenly I?m running slowly
Suddenly it all goes dark

 Tell us, sailor,
 Tell us, please,

 Gay Maltese,
 Hot Mommas from Mexico-

 If you'll forgive a crude remark
 And don't resent a rude remark
 I'll let you into a secret-

 Well?

 They're all alike in the dark!

 There must have been

 With political tact
 I like America best.

 Verse 1
 
 Harry:
 I don't care for China,
 Japan's far too small,
 I've rumbled the Rio Grande,
 I hate Asia Minor,
 I can't bear Bengal
 And I shudder to think
 Of the awful stink
 On the road to Samarkand.
 
 Harry:
 I like America,
 I have played around
 Every slappy-happy hunting ground
 But I find America-okay.
 I've been about a bit
 But I must admit
 That I didn't know the half of it
 Till I hit the U.S.A.
 No likely lass
 In Boston, Mass.
 From passion will recoil.
 In Dallas, Tex.
 They talk of sex
 But only think of oil.
 New Jersey dames
 Go up in flames
 If someone mentions-bed.
 In Chicago, Illinois
 Any girl who meets a boy
 Giggles and shoots him dead!
 But I like America
 Its Society
 Offers infinite variety
 And come what may
 I shall return some day
 To the good old U.S.A.
 
 Verse 2
 
 Harry:
 I've loathed every acre
 From Cannes to Canton,
 I also deplore Bombay,
 I've jeered at Jamaica
 And seen through Ceylon,
 And exploded the myth
 Of those Flying Fith
 On the Road to Mandalay.
 
 Girls:
 We'll never mith
 Those blasted fith
 On the road to Mandalay.
 
 Harry:
 But I like America,
 I have traveled far
 From Northumberland to Zanzibar
 And I find America-okay.
 I've roamed the Spanish Main
 Eaten sugar-cane
 But I never tasted cellophane
 Till I struck the U.S.A.
 All delegates
 From Southern States
 Are nervy and distraught.
 In New Orleans
 The wrought-iron screens
 Are dreadfully overwrought.
 Beneath each tree
 In Tennessee
 Erotic books are read.
 And when alligators thud
 Through the Mississippi mud
 Sex rears its ugly head.

 Every scrap of it,
 All the sentimental crap of it
 And come what may
 Give me a holiday

Courtney Kenny,"In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest-a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ho=ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho

Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The toughest Burmese bandit can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

In the mangrove swamps where the python romps there is peace from 
twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done

No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation
So they just DIY'd that shit and built their own bombs
She's his suicide blond, she's never in gold

Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in

Of a few minutes more

'Cause it's never
Getting any better than this

We are professional ashes of roses
This kerosene's live
You settled your score
This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
This is what we do, we nightmare you

I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heart beat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert
Getting burned
But I'll take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you
I just don't know where I went wrong

She says ""I've lit better""
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Go boy, go boy, run for your life

But there's a whole lot of laughter and love
This house, this house is our home

There's a bed upstairs if you're ever in town
Or if you need a place to get your feet back on the ground
There's coffee in the cupboard, take any food you want out
My house, my house is your home

Tucker's buried in the yard under that old oak we carved
That porch is where you and I first kissed
And there's no shortage of laughter or love
This house, this house is our home
This house, this house is our home",This House,2018
Courtney Marie Andrews,"Is it the journey or the destination?
Is this love or is this addiction?
Circumstances are meant to be
What does that say about you and me?
Karaoke on a Monday night
Television when we want to hide
Frozen dinners when money's tight
Makin' love on a laundry pile

Ain't got much, but we got each other
Not much but love to offer
I took you up
I took you up

Good friends, good company
In every corner of this country
But none of them quite get me
The way you get me
Long drives through the countryside
Cheap motels, diners, and dice
Callin' numbers on the billboard signs
See who picks up on the other line

Ain't got much, but we got each other
Not much but love to offer
I took you up
I took you up

Lonely even when you're standin' there
In so deep with few words to share
Sometimes love gets you so damn depressed
All you can do is hide from it
But I wouldn't have it any other way
Wouldn't take the mansions or the getaways
Wouldn't trade love for a million bucks
If I have you then that's enough

Ain't got much, but we got each other
Not much but love to offer
I took you up
I took you up",Took You Up,2018

El Niño brought a blizzard, the Greyhound brought a boy
Those yellow city lights accent the gutters and the rats
Only the cheap motels were open, wrong side of the tracks

Two cold nights in Buffalo
On the way to see you
Outside town, all the roads are closed
Gonna wash this rust belt new

Snowy prison out on Main Street, heaters hang from the cells
A bum searches for shelter, so cold he dreams of hell
It's that American Dream dying, I hear the whispers of each ghost
Of a wealthy man who once died in downtown Buffalo

Soon they'll be knocking it all down to build that high-rise

What happened to the neighborhood and the neighbors who had moved?
What happened to recreation? That old roller skating rink?
What happened to preserving this town's history?

Courtney Marie Andrews,"I am a lonely woman who loves you
Lonely, I have always been
Many things have found their way between us
But none more than my loneliness

Waxing, waning, always complaining
Always trying to fix what already works
Pining, mining for a feeling I'm not finding
Looking to you to tell me what I'm worth

When morning comes, whistling comes a bluebird
While I try to find a will to wake
My loneliness, it blurs the days together
My loneliness, it pushes you away

Working, pursing in circles, I am searching
Looking for a cure to lift me up
Trying, lying just to keep myself smiling
Believing that our love is strong enough

Can you still see the good inside me?
Or do you see a shell of who I was?
The loneliness has grown so much it shadows
You, the only one I truly love

Coping, hoping for a way of outgrowing
These thoughts that keep me in the dark
Minding, finding, always such bad timing
To learn that only I can ignite the spark
Only I can lift the lonely from my heart",Lift the Lonely From My Heart,2018

Courtney Pine,"[Chorus x 2] 
What's the question?  
Why are you flexin'?
Here's the answer; choice of weapons

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, The Remainz, kid, why you flexin like a bicep?
Heat on your hip just to get a rep; it ain't worth it 
Just because you pack a biscuit doesn't mean you can't 
Become another statistic; you figure it 
Life's a gamble even for vandalz; I handle mine with minds 
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest 
The fear of layin' in wreck causes the stress 
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best

[Guru] 
Yo, little big man, feelin' your oats because you're strapped? 
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black? 
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin' back 
You made a choice, and the choice you made was whack 
Kinda tipsy, with the liquid confidence 
Pullin' your pistol when it doesn't make sense 
To be the bigger man you figure 
But in the end, it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
Yeah, it's the master of the who, what, where, and the why 
But, still, I got a problem with seein' my brothers die 
I've been around and lived past the average age of us 
In every obituary, a full page of us 
The game is money, but what about inner wealth? 
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health 
But still, everyday, the city is a test 
That's why some people feel a gun is the best

[Stikken Moov 2] 
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation 
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin'; I mastered precisions 
Choice of weapon - should I peel or peel out? 
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

[Chorus x 2]

[Stikken Moov 2] 
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in 
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm 
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill, G 
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three

[Guru] 
That's why I wield the steel; yes, my microphone is crazy real 
I'm not the one sellin' out to get the mass appeal 
But jail cells are filled with my peeps 
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill-ass streets 

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
So, pick your weapon - a mic or a gun 
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns; check it 
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids 
One stepped to me, asked me to freestyle, kid 
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side 
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride 
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface 
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, you think you're all that, 'cause you pack heat? 
Seein' your own brother play the concrete in defeat 
Tryin' to prove yourself while you put the next man down 
But what goes around, comes back, black; best believe that

[Chorus x 2]

Courtney Taylor-Taylor,"My father is a doctor, he's a familiar man
My mother works for charity whenever she can
They're both good clean Americans who abide by the law
They both stick up for liberty, they both support the law
My happiness was paid for when they laid their money down
For Summers in a Summer camp, and Winters in the town
My future in the system was talked about and planned
But I gave it up for music and the free electric band

I went to school in hand-washed shirts with neatly oiled hair
The school was big and newly built and filled with light and air
And the teacher taught his values that we had to learn to keep
And he clipped the ear of many idle kid who went to sleep
My father organized for me a college in the East
But I went to California, the sun-shine and the beach
My parents and my lecturers could never understand
Why I gave it up for music and the free electric band

Well, they used to sit and speculate upon their son's career
A lawyer or a doctor or a civil engineer
Just give me bread and water, put a guitar in my hand
'Cause all I need is music and the free electric band

My father sent me money and I spent it very fast
On a girl I met in Berkeley in a social science class
Yes, and we learned about her body, but her mind we didn't know
Until the brutal attitudes and morals began to show
She wanted to get married, even though she never said
But I knew her well enough by now to see inside her head
She'd settle for suburbia and a little patch of land
So I gave her up for music and the free electric band",The Free Electric Band,2010

I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone
I can't keep from crying sometimes

Early in the morning
About the break of day
I fall down on my knees
I fall down and I pray
I think about my woman

I watch the sun go down

Deep ripened soft betrayal

I blinked my eyes and you were gone
Were you real or did I imagine
You seemed to go with the light of dawn

Today I thought I saw you
Why does it all seem
So very strange
I'm haunted by these things
They drive me crazy
Maybe insane

Then someone smiled at me
And I don't know
If that's good or bad
I'm haunted by these things
Could it be the moon
Or have I gone mad

I remember your kisses
They were so sweet
Soft on my face
As to feel you in my arms
Intoxicated
My heart starts to race

Every moment a lifetime
And I must spend them all with you
Sun embracing the shadows
They all turn to dust
Now what do I do

Today I thought I saw you
Why does it all seem
So very strange
I'm haunted by these things
They drive me crazy

As shadows shift from gray to red I notice there's no floor
Transparent air suspends my weight as if I had no mass

Wet and cold from shifting daydreams wakeful in the sleep
Windowpane observing some commotion down below
Waiting for the noise to come to blur the weary mind
Watching as a pastime and I'm the fallen star

In and out from foreign shores I've gone astray in time
Born to search for something I have never ever seen
On an endless quest to hostile ground and unknown lands

As shadows shift from red to gray I notice there's no floor
And gravity awakes me as it throws me to the ground
A million tiny grains of dust obscures me from your eyes

Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen

Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the distant hum
Searchlights in my eyes
I never took the time
I should have told you then
I never found the time
Falling out of cars

I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
Blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
Guided by the city light
I'm lost and found

I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
Blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground

Covenant,"I know how it ended up here on this frozen, nameless shore.
I remember nothing of the journey, and there's no one else around.
I cut down across the towering dunes to see the seagulls glide above.
So graceful when they are silent like lonely white ghosts in the air.

I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.

As I look and dream myself away, a sound is loud enough to hear,
Like disembodied, friendly voices carried on by southbound winds.
I wake up to the sound of silence, it's wasn't faint and far away,
Like the finest spray of water, they still speak of things I know. 

I turn to fix my eyes on the horizon, and I face the freezing gale. 
I observe the majestic wide waves as they rise and break and fall.

I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.

While they rise into the wild wind that picks them up before they strike,
Steals away their urgent faces, lifts the spirits to the skies.
And the language, soft and broken, but still, I understand it well.
We talk about the ones we care for and of all the things we lost.

I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.

Coverdale/Page,"You said you'd give me love,
Instead you caused me pain.
You made me curse an' slam the door,
An' hang my head in shame
But, it's over now, it's over now.

You talked to me of virtue,
An' sang a song so sweet
But, all I know is I could smell the perfume of deceit.
An' it's over now, it's over now.

You told me of your innocence,
An' I believed it all
But, your best friend is your vanity,
An' the mirror on the wall.
It's over now.

I turned away from what I heard,
An' everything I saw

How you gonna feel, when you finally lose it all,
How you gonna look, standing up against the wall,
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna say, when you feel the hammer fall,
I'm gonna see you crawl.

You took your pills an' washed them down,
An' then you talked for hours.
I tried to build a garden,
But, you trampled all the flowers.

Always after more.

Baby, I’ve known you for a long long time
I never thought that we would find
What we’re holding in our hands
Lately, I’ve been thinking I should make you mine
Been thinking that we should define
What we are, what we are, oh oh

And you know I love to be in control
But recently I don’t know what to do
I’m losing it over you, oh

When you say my name
I can feel the flame getting stronger

Held in my heart for a day like today
I wanna hold you till the light fades away
I wanna hold you till the light fades away

When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,

So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.

Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Wondering what it was I said

When I knew I lost my heart instead

Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words

And the only place you can go is down!

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator,

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,

In Nashville there is a lighter
In a case for all to see
It speaks of dreams and heartaches

Lonesome words scrawled in a drunken hand

And immediately he'd miss her,
Like a spell, with each breath,

Trying so desperately to get his attention

Dark tension building like the clouds of a storm
Her daughter's in her room and she's at the door
Trying to figure what all this fuss is for.

I want to be with you, babe, if you want to be with me
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all night

It's not that I am asking you to take part in any kind of quest
It's just that I ain't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all night

I am just a poor girl trying to connect
I certainly don't want you thinking that I ain't got any respect
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else' you got to stay all night

It ain't that I am wanting anything that you never gave before
It's just that I'll be sleeping and it will be too dark for you to find the door
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all night
","If You Gotta Go, Go Now",1999
Cowboy Junkies,"Door slams, car starts, he's on the road
She's left there sitting, angry and alone
Thinking what she should have said
Well, maybe she should have gone to bed
Now his words are swirling around in her head

He said and she said
And they both yelled together
Neither one hearing or listening to the other
Words like 'you never..' and 'you don't understand'
One word, then another
And then the whole thing's out of hand

But love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you

Siren screams, breaks through her dreams
She rolls to the right
She realizes that he's still lost to the night
She gets out of bed both worried and mad
She prays that he's safe, her hanger holds back the drape

But love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you

Door opens and in walks her baby
With a look on her face, says 'I'm sorry'
Now's not the time or the place to play games
So you hold out your hand and he does the same

And love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you

Love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you
",Love's Still There,1999
Cowboy Junkies,"Hollow boned and feathered
She fell to him,
Wriggling perdition she plucked
From deep within.
Feasted high on flowering branches
The fruit of his heart he gave willingly
For her song.
From fresh wounds
Were gathered thick sheaves of love.
He lay open palmed to her world

She stretched in arched abeyance,
Holding thunderclap and starlight in one mind.
Sad to see the season go.
I'll miss the crackling of the air,
The loss of all I know.
Sad to see the season go.

Indian corn and the bitter taste of envy in the air.
Mired now in cyclic decay.
The nag of conquest.
Skeletal arms
Embrace a withering world.
Sad to see the season go.

I'll miss the crackling of the air,
The loss of all I know.
Sad to see the season go.
Locked here these dreams of you,
Imperfect dormant seeds.
There is a dignity
To this solitude,
A sparkling ambiguity
Both liquid and solid at one time.",Sad to See the Season Go,1999
Cowboy Junkies,"The water is wide, I can not cross over
 Neither have I wings to fly
 Give me a boat that can carry two
 and both shall row, my love and I
 Love is gentle and love is kind
 The sweetest flower when first it's new
 But love grows old and waxes cold
 and fades away like morning dew
 The water is wide, I can not cross over
 Neither have I wings to fly
 Give me a boat that can carry two
 and both shall row, my love and I
 and both shall row, my love and I",The Water Is Wide,1999
Cowboy Junkies,"Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor girl like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor girl like me
Every time I hit your crystal city you know
You're gonna make a wreck outta me

Well, the first time I lose I drink whiskey
Second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
'Cause I think I'm gonna win

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor girl like me, no
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor girl like me
Every time I hit your Crystal City you know

Well, the Queen of Spades is a friend of mine
The Queen of Hearts, she's a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is which

Ooh, Las Vegas

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor girl like me

Well, I spend all night with the dealer
Tryin' to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Tryin' to get out of bed

Cowboy Junkies,"She hugged his head so hard to her heart
it made her gasp for air
If this was not the way Love felt
then for love she did not care
I want to run beside a moving train
yelling farewells in the rain
The tears will be bittersweet,
'cause I know I'll see him again

[Chorus]
If I lost you now,
I would feel as hollow as a bone

He could not help but hang his eyes
her beauty held him so
If this was not a state of Grace
then Grace he'd never know
I want to yell farewell from a crowded pier
just me and a thousand good-byes
The tears will be bittersweet,
'cause soon she'll be back my side

[Chorus]

You won't lose me, he replied,
together our lives have been sewn
If I lost you now,
I would feel as hollow as a bone
We will kiss goodnight under a starlit sky
whisper oaths at a lumbering moon
dream sweet dreams before the morning comes
and serves us the dawn in our room

[Chorus]",Hollow as a Bone (Revisited),2000
Cowboy Junkies,"She was found beneath the gate,
Forsaken at the gate.
Who would have thought that so much love
Could be so carelessly misplaced.
Found. Beneath the gate.

We gazed upon the moon,
A honed and whetted moon.
Wondered if you saw the same
An hour from your mothers womb.
Gazing at the moon.

We stood beneath the gate.
Three beneath the gate.
The rare good will of the random world,
Smiling like a sickle moon.

She was found beneath the gate.
Forsaken at the gate.
Found beneath the gate.",Beneath the Gate,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"Well I'm lyin' in my bed, a tangle of arms and legs,
But the one that I'm with is not the one bouncing 'round my head.
I could turn this into song or cheap fantasy,
But whatever I've ignited will still burn in me.

Bread and wine, bread and wine, your heart ain't nearly as guilty as mine.

I'm a dark heavy heart. I'm a soul full of holes.
I'm a boat that is sinking, muddy waters threatening this baggage in my hold.
And there's a line in my head from an old gospel song,
But no matter how hard I try, the words they just come out wrong.

Bread and wine, bread and wine your thoughts aint nearly as wicked as mine.
Bread and wine, bread and wine your cross aint nearly as heavy as mine.

I've been graced by the gift of a gold wedding band.
I've been soothed by the simple caress of my true love's hand.
And yet I'm lyin' in my bed, a tangle of arms and legs,
And the one that I'm with is not the one that I'm dreaming of.

Bread and wine, bread and wine, won't you please be my bread and wine.
Bread and wine, bread and wine, won't you please be my bread and wine.",Bread and Wine,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"I want to walk away
Like Judas from the table.
Turn my back
And walk away.

I want to close my eyes
Like that novice at the altar.
Bow my head
And close my eyes.

Sorrow took Love's splintered hands
And waltzed her 'cross a painted floor.
Whispered softly in her ear,
""let's get outta here"".

I'm going to breathe the air
That my children will be breathing.
Breathe them out
And breathe them in again.

I'm going to close my eyes
And walk away.
Turn my back
Bow my head
And close my eyes.",Close My Eyes,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"Stuck in that dark hole again.
Someone throw me a ladder
On which I can depend.
Someone give me a handhold
To help me ascend.
Someone give me a reason 
To start up these walls once again.

Lost in those gray clouds again.
Trying to punch my way through them
As fear settles in.
Earth growing larger as I fall into a spin.
Someone give me a reason
To take on those gray clouds again.

Caught in this rip tide again.
My mouth wide open,
The sea pouring in.
Perhaps I'll just float here
And see where this journey ends.
Until someone gives me a reason 
To stay clear of those rip tides again.",Dark Hole Again,2001
