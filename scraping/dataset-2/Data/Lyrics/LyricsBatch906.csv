Bebossa,"Tuém tuém, ocupado pela décima vez
Tuém, telefono e não consigo falar
Tuém tuém, tô ouvindo há mais de um mês
Tuém, já começa quando eu penso em discar
Eu já estou desconfiado
Que ela deu meu telefone pra mim
Tuém tuém, e dizer que a vida inteira esperei
Tuém, que dei duro e me matei pra encontrar
Tuém tuém, toda lista quase que eu decorei
Tuém, dia e noite não parei de discar
E só vendo com que jeito
Pedia pra eu ligar
Tuém tuém, não entendo mais nada
Pra que que eu fui topar?
Trim trim, não me diga que agora atendeu
Será que eu, eu consegui agora encontrar
A moça atendeu
""Alô""",Telefone,
Bebossa,"Só me lembro muito vagamente
Correndo você vinha, quando de repente
Seu sorriso que era muito branco me encontrou
Só me lembro que depois andamos 
Mil estrelas só nós dois contamos
E o vento soprou de manhã, mil canções
Só me lembro, muito vagamente
De tarde que morria, quando de repente
Eu sozinho, fiquei lhe esperando e chorei
Só me lembro muito vagamente
O quanto a gente amou e foi tão de repente
Que nem lembro se foi com você
Que eu perdi meu amor",Vagamente,
Bebossa,"Você manhã de todo meu 
Você que cedo entardeceu 
Você de quem a vida eu sou
E sei mas eu serei
Você um beijo bom de sol
Você em cada tarde vã
Virá sorrindo de manhã
Você um riso rindo à luz
Você a paz dos céus azuis
Você sereno bem de amor em mim 
Você tristeza que eu criei
Sonhei você pra mim
Vem mais pra mim mas só",Você,
Becc Lester,"Watching the sun
Watching it come
Watching it come up 
Over the rooftops

Cloudy and warm
Maybe a storm
You can never quite tell
From the morning

And it's going to be a day
There is really no way to say no
To the morning

Yes it's going to be a day
There is really nothing left to
Say but
Come on morning

Waiting for mail
Maybe a tail
From an old friend
Or even a lover

Sometimes there's none
But we have fun
Thinking of all
Who might have written

And maybe there are seasons
And maybe they change
And maybe to love 
Is not so strange

The sounds of the day
They hurry away
Now they are gone 
Until tomorrow

When day will break
And you will wake
And you will rake your hands
Across your eyes and realize

That it's going to be a day
There is really no way 
To say no to the morning

Yes it's going to be a day
There is really nothing left to say but
Come on morning

Becca Duran,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You,2001
Becca Duran,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,2001
Becca Duran,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew,2001
Becca Duran,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

And as I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, somebody's broken heart
In one man soul
And they follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got no place to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
Change
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah, oh no

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I gotta get it right while I have the time
You can't close your, your mind, the man, the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and make that change

Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah, ooh, yeah, yeah, gonna make the change",Man in the Mirror,2016
Becca Stevens Band,"Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is a wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring be a higher love

I'm not too late for it

I can be your new addiction

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack

When everybody talks back

You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose

Out where the lightning splits the sea

Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach is like a fire in my blood

I can juggle while I?m spinning round
Take all the dark clouds away

The spotlights on me
And everybody wants the clown to be
The one who laughs at the world
They think I?m their funny girl

With a painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown

I balance between 
The truth and what lies hidden up my sleeve
And when it all gets too hard
I just play the joker card

Another curtain call
Another routine where I did it all
Every trick and surprise 
To keep my thin disguise

A painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown

Did you hear the one about the girl,
Who hid inside her circus world?
Now she wonders what it?s all for
Coz it?s not funny anymore

And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most

Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown

And phone calls from people in Chicago

Write everything and

'bout me and my friends and some things that occurred
We thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in mexico

I was workin at mcdonalds, doin' the latenight run
When a car pulled up the drive through and pointed out a gun
Said give us all your money and three big macs to go
I stuffed them all in a bag and I ducked down below

Well the boss got angry when he found out I didn't call the police
I guess I was kinda nervous, there was a warrant out on me
Concernin' some jaywalkin tickets I couldn't afford to pay
Needless to say I got the axe that same day

Well me bein' outta work just then I didn't wanna go home
My mom said if I lost this job I'd have to go out on my own
So I went over to dave's house and got really stoned
Called up some girls but none o' them were home

Steve came over and he brought some alcohol
We're all gettin really depressed just starin' at the wall
Thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in mexico

Steve's dad had a huntin' rifle and we went and picked it up
And we stopped into the 7-11 to try our luck
We raised up that huntin' rifle but the counter guy just laughed

In the shadows of sulphur

In a house of disrepute

And syphilis patients

Like searchlights

Their souls are fluorescent

Vibrates with pleasure

Their hand grenade eyes

To the landlord living inside my head 
Never paid my rent till the lights went dead 
Then I saw my sign comin' up the road 
A dead ditch waiting for to bury my load 
On the avenues in the plain of day 
I threw a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain 

Now hold your hand onto the plow 
Work your body till the sun goes down 
What's left of death is more than fear 
Let dust be dust and the good lord near 
It's a little too much to ask of faith 
It's a little late to wait for fate 
So tell the angels what you seen 
Scarecrow shadow on a Nazarene

When darkness has fallen 
Round your bed 
Kindness will follow 
Children will wander

Shoot your mouth off if you know where you're aimin'

Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handin' out a confection of venom

Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of the gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

The good in us is all we know

And we will rise in the cool of the evening

When the gravity shackles were wild
Something is vacant when I think it's all beginning

Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know

Shoot your mouth off if you know where you're aiming
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you

Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom

Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

I shake a leg on the ground like an epileptic battery man.
I'm making my move, lettin' loose like a belt.
Little worse for wear, but I'm wearing it well.
Tell me what's wrong with a little grind and bump
When the stereos erupt with a kick-drum punch?
Once you do it once, probably do it again and again.
You did it before, but you're more erratic then them.
And you had a rough night, and the vibe's just begun.
Let a little bit of this, the past week is done.
Don't let it hold you back, but you're already set.
No dead flowers gonna grow till the dirt gets wet.

Put the elevator music on.
Pull me back where I belong.
The ambulance sings along.
The fly on the wall
Doesn't know what's wrong.
If I could forget myself,
Find another lie to tell.
If I had a soul to sell,
I'd buy some time
To talk to my brain cells.

Gut bucket and a bottle of pains.
It's like the schoolhouse lights will never turn on again.
Till the bottom wears off of these high-heeled boots.
The bodies all move, some backbone roots.
Everybody workin' hard till the yard's all clean.
The dishes wash good in the washin' machine.
Now you brush your teeth and you comb back your hair.
You drive your vehicle like you just didn't care.
You're walkin' to work with the boys and the girls.
And you're doin' it to death, cause it's the end of the world.
Now everybody's sweatin', forgettin' what's on their minds.
With your hand like a mirror, you can see what's inside.
When you're down and out, poundin' and there's nothing that's real.
It's like a plastic heart, too amputated to feel.

I got a soda can bible song, paranoid Jumbotron.
The lord took the weekend off.

With the birds of prey and the weapon's on the fire.
She's riding a landslide down to me,
Cutting the shackles off of me,
Shaking the dead birds from the trees,
She's taking the only air I breathe.

Are you lost in the plate glass sermon?
Don't call it death for me installment plan,
She's putting the armor on my back,
Rigging the coals over the tracks,
Taking a knife out from the stack,

Out of the frame
I shake a leg on the ground

With a kick drum punch?

Probably do it again and again

A pass with this gun

Until the dirt gets wet

You could find another lie to tell

I'd buy some time
To talk to my brain cell

And you comb back your hair
You drive your vehicle

Forgettin' what's on their minds

It's like a plastic heart
Too amputated to feel

A paranoid Jumbo-tron

The cell phone's ringing
I could talk to my brain cell

With the birds of prey and the weapon’s on the fire.

Cutting the shackles off of me,
Shaking the dead birds from the trees,
She’s taking the only air I breathe.

Are you lost in the plate glass sermon?

She’s putting the armor on my back,
Rigging the coals over the tracks,
Taking a knife out from the stack,

Spinning out of control on a broken carousel

Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise!

And after shows
We got funky people on the highs and lows

Beckah Shae,"I'ma go there, got no fear, I'm not scared no
Revelation come! I wanna know why I'm, 
Watchin' what I'm watchin'
Hearin' what I'm hearin'
Doin' what I'm doin'
Consuming what I'm consuming

All the fishies swimming in the same direction
All swallowin', followin', with no hesitation.
Buyin' what they're buyin'
Wearin' what they're wearin'
Lovin' what they're lovin'
Goin where everyone's goin'

Where are all the questions?

In a world of mystery
I'ma keep searchin', till you show me
With both eyes open, I won't sleep
I'ma keep searchin' till you show me
I can hear it on the stereo, see it on the telly
Oh, no, I won't be deceived! 
Illuminate the truth to me
I'ma keep searchin' till you show me

There, everywhere, signs symbols
Open up your eyes, ?cause there ain't much time
Till were gonna go home
So watch what you're watchin'
Hear what you're hearin'
Do what you're doin'
And know what you're consuming

Ignorance ain't bliss when you're standin' in the fire
There's a way that seems ok, 
Don't die, by a liar
So don't buy what they're buyin'
Care what their wearin', 
Love how they're lovin'
And don't go where everyone's goin'

Where are all the questions?

You are life
So open up my eyes
You are mine, Jesus
And I will seek until I find
The whole truth, 
So you won't see me fallin'
For nothing but you
'Cause you are the truth",Show Me,2011

And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand

How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me 
So I went and found my own 
I would climb the garden wall

On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder 
Often told but never seen 
Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky 
Every man and beast appeared 
A friend as real as I

When there wasn't even any Hollywood 
They heard the call 
And they wrote it on the wall

Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name 
Nothin' here but history 
Can you see what has been done

Now I step into the sun

That stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down

Wish I was a hired gun
A cruel shogun, a poor man's son
One day I'd stop and click my heels
Turn around to see

My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down

The troubadour is in disguise
Bats and curious I use my eyes
My own two hands were on the keys
This was no mystery

My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down

Becker & Fagen,"Hey people 
I can't seem to make up my mind 
Cause I'm undecided 
You're the reason why 
My delay is just a way of telling you that I 
I love you 
Go away 
I hate you 
No please stay 
I want you 
I'm so undecided 
So divided inside of me 
Hey baby 
Suddenly I found that my whole world is turned upside down 
And I'm broken hearted 
I confess the crime 
Who can free this heart of me?

Becker & Fagen,"Hunting in the Sea of Japan,
Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him.
So bold with his gun in his hand,
Of his furs there was no need to remind him.
Tripping over a Holy Man,
Mind that here you don't choose your friends,
Ambrose asked for a helping hand,
He heaved his chest, and pointed West,
To where the river runs.
With Josie back home on his mind,
Brushing off the fruit flies of the season,
And 'Brosie was surely struck blind,
By a sight that defies human reason:
On an island of gleaming rock,
Jutting up from the blue lagoon,
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode,
That made our hero swoon.
A finer minor from China.
The World when the traveler returned,
As you know played out its bloody romances.
But Ambrose he knew what he'd learned,
With his prize in hand he took his chances.
Soon the sound that delights the ear,
Blended in with the armies' roar.
When the warriors strained to hear,
This new bebop, this shooting star,
Their guns were bullet-full.
A finer minor from China.
A finer minor from China.
A finer minor from China.",Yellow Peril,1994
"Becker, Brennan, Hoagg","In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till he returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand",In Christ Alone,2009

It could be me

Dismantle your design
Contaminate and deface your convictions
Recreate your state of mind

We'll celebrate the day
When everything that your were is rejected

And before this night is through

Your devotion sickens me
If there's a fracture in your moral ground
I'll find a break and I'll bring you down

And you will swear to a brand new allegiance
Hope to die and cross your heart
You'll abandon the things you believe in
With total disregard

And as the flag of your past life is burning
We'll dance around the fire
Swept away by the tides that are turning
You'll succumb to my desire

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, first grade, Oak street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I’m reading up the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa’s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it’s just who is that girl?
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I’m on tour
One thing’s for sure, I'mma always be me
That west side? Becky, Becky, Becky G

Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, what you know about the in and out lines?
And what you know about that 4×5 drive?
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I’m on Hollywood and Vine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley!
And one day I'mma bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I’ll be bringing home randies
Donuts, so what? Holler when you see me
I’m still the same B, even when I’m on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain’t no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can’t catch me roaming in my barrio
I’m with my litas praying the Rosario
Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood

I bottle them and sell them when the sun shines
Cold sores erupt if you don't keep lysine levels healthy
A tingle on your lip, should come and see me

Many foods are rich in arginine
Concentrate on the ones with more lysine
Highest levels of all in margarine

Was hidden by my interest in his great plan
His dying 4/4 gasp withdrew his wait from the game
Now listening posts in Fnac will carry my name

Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know

They're seriously saying it's prolonging me life,
If I'll only submit to the surgical knife?
But what are the odds on a month or a week?
When the betting shop's closing its doors, so to speak.
When you're tied to a pump and a breathing machine,
With their X-rays and probes and their monitor screens,
And they'll wake ye up hungry, saying ""How do ye feel?""
And then you're stuffed full of pills and a barium meal.

Prolonging me life? Now that's some kind of joke!
I'd be laughing me head off and I'd probably choke.
The spirit's still willing but the rest of me's weak,
Now the bets are all off and the prospects look bleak,
When you're laid like a piece of old meat on the slab,
And they'll cut and they'll slice, and they'll poke and they'll jab,
And they'll grill ye and burn ye, and they'll wish ye good health,
With their radium, chemo and God knows what else?

Well ye can't fault the science, though the logic is weak,
Is it really an eternal life we should seek?
That ship has sailed,
That ship has sailed,
That ship has already sailed… so to speak.

Our mission is more than a struggle for breath,
For a few extra rounds in a fight to the death.
When our mission is love, and compassion and grace,
It's not a test of endurance, or a marathon race.
For love is the sabre, and love is the shield,
Love is the only true power we wield,
An eternal love is all ye should seek,
That ship will be ready to sail… so to speak.

I hear what you're saying 'cos I've heard it before,
But I'm afraid if I let what is past through my door,
How long would he stay, a month or a week,

Should I settle for something that's safe on this Earth?
What would it profit me, what is it worth?
If I lose something precious, completely unique?

When it's only eternity's love we should seek

For when that ship sails, and the course has been set,

Where'd you get that money?

I'd fall in love with you again

Long as I live without you I would still be there 
I wanna die, die away

Nothing but a lonely night

Holding it down there's gotta be another horizon

Pools of water iced from cold night

In the morning
It is the morning of my life

In the daytime, I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands

In the morning
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening, I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of the ceiling in my room
Where we'll stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothes lines, may I be yawning

It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life

One prayer within me burning. 
And there's no price on what you hold till it's gone, 
Then it keeps moving on. 
  
Where is my heart? 
You know I will be waiting to be a part of you 
And never feel the pain. 
How can you say to me that I should go on living? 
I left the only life I had with you. 
  
The only love. 
No use in me pretending 
To be a part of you 
And you the heart of me. 
How can you say to me that I should go on living? 
I left the only life I had 
With, with you. 
With you. 
  
So we agree to let each other go. 
No long goodbye. 
Just your way and my way. 
And I can stand how you cried to be free. 
High as the wind blows, 
But not enough to bring you home to me. 
And only lonely knows. 
  
You see my open arms. 
You know my flame is burning. 
But I'm too blind to see the end has begun. 
And it keeps moving on. 
  
The only love. 
No use in me pretending 
To be a part of you 
And you the heart of me. 
How can you say to me that I should go on living? 
I left the only life I had 
With you. 
  
The only love. 
No use in me pretending 
To be a part of you 
And you the heart of me. 
How can you say to me that I should go on living? 
I left the only life I had 
With you. 
  
The only love. 
One love that will not die. 
You may be sorry that I built my world around you. 
The only love 
Is only you and I. 
There will be others who would leave you as I found you. 
  
The only love. 
One love that will not die",The Only Love,1991

on my blue island.

See you on a blue island.
Take you to a blue island.

You can see the rain.
You can feel the pain
that no part of me is going through.

we can find a way.
Do you know the place you're going to?

You're going to a blue island.

This is what the lonely heart must know.
This is what it takes to make it grow.
You could be a child alone.
But you may save the world.

Maybe it's the words that mean goodbye.

And I won't be too late

You will see me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight,
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning.

You will find me waiting by the ocean floor,
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands,
In the morning.

Minutes take so long to drift away

The ceiling in my room

May I be yawning

Want to take your valley low.

Let me in and close the door
Until the morning light.

Make me wait,
We separate but only to return.

Whisper and I'll be there.

I just want to drown in your desire.

All the cream is rising to the top.
And it's the love you save from dying.

No matter what the people say
Or try to do
Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too

People talk and try to break us up
When we know they don't understand
Well, I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holding her hand

Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they're trying so very hard
To pull us apart
Well, we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on loving this way
But if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never never let her go
No matter what the people may say
Or try to do
Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too

And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too

Bee Gees,"I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I've been waiting for the coalman
He's a whole man and he treats me nice
Ev'rybody needs a coalman
When you're low man , you can get advice
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody, when she's not there

I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down

Bee Gees,"What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I lost in a daydream
Dreamin''bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me in my sweet dream
Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy toad

And you can be sure that if you're feelin' right
A daydream will last along into the night 
Tomorrow at breakfast you may pick up your ears
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad

Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Costume made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream 
Dreamin' 'about my bundle of joy",Daydream,1998
Bee Gees,"Hush my darling , sleep my lover
There'll be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the lord arranges

Oh my darling , now I found you
Want to live all my life around you
You're my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow

I just want to hold you forever , forever
Loving one another that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

Oh my darling , if you leave me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Not knowing angel , what's coming after
Never hearing you're golden laughter

Oh my baby , hearts like thunder
Can't escape from the spell I'm under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure

I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

If I fall in love , it's only with you
And if I call for love, it's got to be true
But if you fail . to keep it a tie
Then I'll know, it's only a lie
And I'll know what to do
Oh, I'll know what to do

If you wear my ring , you wear it for me
You've got to wear that thing indefinitely
And if you're bad , even just for a while
I'll be sad , then I'll push you behind

I am a man of words, the few words I say
If you play my game , you play it my way
If you don't , one look in your eye

Her heart isn't for a game
So tell her , you don't feel the same
For that's a terrible way to treat your baby

It's a drag to leave my door
Guess I'll have to say
I just cry my life away

And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings

Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks

Bee Gees,"I got to say it and it's hard for me. 
You got me crying like I thought I would never be. 
Love is believing but you let me down. 
How can I love you when you ain't around. 
And I.

Get to the morning and you never call. 
Love should be everything or not at all. 
And it don't matter whatever you do. 
I made a life out of loving you. 

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying. 
I'm crying in the rain. 
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting. 
Feeling no pain, 
when will we meet again. 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
is it a lesson that I never knew? 
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under. 
My love for you. 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by. 
This world may end, 
not you and I. 

My love is stronger than the universe. 
My soul is crying for you 
and that cannot be reversed. 
You made the rules and you could not see 
you made a life out of hurting me. 

Out of my mind, 
I am held by the power of you love. 
Tell me when do we try. 
Or should we say goodbye? 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker

Bee Gees,"I saw my problems and I'll see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word

They think our love is just a growin' pain
Why don't they understand? It's just a cryin' shame
Their lips are lyin', only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel, grease is the word

(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion

We take the pressure, and we throw away conventionality, belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word

This is a life of illusion, a life of control
Mixed with confusion - what're we doin' here?
