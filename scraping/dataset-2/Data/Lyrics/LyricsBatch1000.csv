Shelia Southern,"This time we almost made the pieces fit
Didn't we?
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we?
This time I had the answer, right here in my hand
Then I touched it and it had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made it, made it to the moon 
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long hard climb
Didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we almost make it this time?",Didn't We,1992
Shelia Southern,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon","Up, Up and Away",1992
Shelia Southern,"Girl, I heard you're getting married
Girl, I heard you're getting married
This time you're really sure
And this is the end
They say you really mean it
This guy's the one that makes you feel
So safe, so sane and so secure
And baby if he loves you more than me
And baby if he loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen to me.

I'm never gettin' married, never gettin' married
You know that's not my scene
But a girl like you needs to be married
I've known all along you couldn't live forever
in between.

And baby if he loves you more than me
And baby if he loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen to me.

And girl I don't really blame you
For having a dream of your own
Hey girl I don't really blame you
A woman like you needs a house and a home.

Baby if he really loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen to me.

Oh girl don't wanna get married
Girl I'm never, never gonna marry
Oh it's the worst thing that could happen
Oh girl.....",The Worst That Could Happen,1992

Shell,"OK this what I learned from the streets
Handle your beef
Your playing with keys
Sleep with your heat
Your a role model if partner gotta be me
All hoes ain't sweet, they messing
Everything happens for a reason but they all lessons
If you stressed then pick your head up, nigga,
Get your bread up, nigga,
If your scared, scared niggas get they head bust
I make you catch a heart attack, in starter hats
Just left downtown I got my forty back
A situation started, nigga I'm never smiling
Beast mode until they take me, got that from mobbing
Any nigga who watch you up and down want something you got
Why my enemies iffing me got that from pop
If I flop then it's back to selling blocks
Back to telling niggas they can't hustle in my spot, off the top
My daddy raised me to hate a cop
So all my motherfuckin' life, I hated cops
Cam rich told me niggas change when you give them blocks
Nigga told me when I ride better keep it cocked

[Chorus]
This what I learned from the streets
Keep it real lil' nigga
Keep your steel lil' nigga
Fuck these hoes lil nigga
Forgot your roles lil' nigga
This what I learned from the streets
Watch your back lil' nigga
Keep it strapped lil' nigga
You lil' axe lil' nigga
A real gutter nigga and your nuts a lil' bigga

People rose around me
Money is money so concentrate when you count it
Every nigga who bounce ain't no gangsta ass nigga
And I learned that from riches
Spoil all the dope fiends
I learned that from pitchas
Fred city show me how to roll that killa
Big Loton show me how to come with rhythm
Ever since then I've been the sickest in the system
Dunking down on Jacobs took me on my first mission
I jumped out bustin' fuck it you ain't saying nothin'
Ivy showed me how to cook it up and get it hard
Put me on this jewelry shit I miss my boy
Look, no matter how good you treat em
That dope will make em do evil learn that from that clown jeefers
These nigga turning on they own people
These niggas devils out here

[Chorus]

The streets told me boy gutter keep that thang on ya
And fuck your friends cause most niggas still change on ya
These streets cold so you gotta keep that heater close
Might be your boy that's tryin' burn u, dog you never know
Man look these hoes ain't no better they be vulchers too
I crossed one of those niggas and I ain't crossing u
Just keep it G and have some game like the bosses do
Know you the shit but homie keep em flies off of you
Keep your mouth all open shut when people talk to you
You don't know shit no matter how much time they offer you
Don't stop until you got enough to a vault or 2
And know one thing there's a slight chance you'll take a loss or 2
Keep your eyes open and you'll get all the way to the streets
It's money over everything till you rest in peace
Keep your eyes open and you'll get all the way to the streets
It's money over everything till you rest in peace

[Chorus]",What I Learned from the Streets,2010
Shell,"Well fuck it, go on, turn the music up again
I heat the streets up like a oven, it ain't nothin'
I want mine just hit me up when it's ""on time""
I ain't duct-taped me a nigga up in a long time!
I'm'a die thuggin' I think I'm'a die bustin'
I'm'a die hustlin, 'cause I refuse to die with nothin'
Bumpin' crews who drove from Cali in my old school two-tone
They missed me niggas barely, I want they whole fuckin' crew gone!
In that zone, where there ain't no smirks, niggas get murked
Just keep hidin 'cause it's too late to go to church, now
Show you muthafuckers how this trill shit work, now
Turn your shit into the 4th of Ju-ly, boo-ya!

Shellee Ann Kellee,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face

Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me

You to dream there's always a chance

I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song

Shelley Burns,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between
But what has been
is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just an echo of a sigh
Goodbye

All my life I shall remember knowing you
All the pleasure I have found in showing you
The different ways
That one may phrase
The changing light
And changing shade
Happiness that must die
Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

I'll see you again
When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between
But what has been
is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just an echo of a sigh

Shelley Fabares,"Gray skies are gonna clear up,
Put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face.
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style;
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!
Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,
Slap on a happy grin!
And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine

I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly

He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""

Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

Shelly Berg,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

Every promise you were bound to break

That you don't know where the time went

Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy

Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you

You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1962

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Baby, baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never been so sure, what am I gonna do?

I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again

Sweeter than the taste of a midnight rendevous, so sensual
The look upon your face when you love me tender and my cup was full
Softer than the sigh when it all was over and I slumbered deep
Lost inside your love like there's no tomorrow as I fall back to sleep

Baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around

In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,1993

Yeah, you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Touched for the first time)

Like the one in me
That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it

I'm like a black crow flying in a blue, blue sky

In search of love and music my whole life has been
Illumination, corruption and diving, diving, diving, diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying in a blue sky

I looked at the morning after being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window and I, I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying in a blue sky

Shenandoah,"Mill worker houses lined up in a row, 
Another southern Sunday morning blow 
Beneath the steeple all the people have begun 
Shakin' hands with the man who grips the gospel gun 
While the quiet prayer, the smell of dinner on the ground 
Heals up the morning air, ain't nothin' sweeter around

I can almost hear my mama pray: 
""Oh lord forgive us when we doubt,"" 
Another sacred Sunday in the south

A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all 
Popping in the wind like an angry cannon ball 
The holes of history are cold and still, 
But they smell the powder burnin' and they probably always will

And on the old town square under the barber shop pole, 
They sat me up in the chair when I was four years old

I can almost hear my papa say: 
""Won't you hold still son, stop squirmn' around 
Another sacred sundays coming down""

But girl, when life’s not fair
Just know that I’ll be there

With a shoulder to always lean on
And a heart that will always be strong
Through valleys and hills, gray skies or blue

Take my word, I will love you until

You stole my heart away, from clear across the room
And somehow it was plain you felt the same

All a wise man needs
Is one glimpse of destiny

That no one but that perfect match can start
Like a bolt of lightning flashing in the dark
When fate lights forever up call it magic, call it love

Until that night, love at first sight
Was just a childish fantasy, like wishing on a star
If you ask me now, don’t ask me how
All I can say is I believe, the proof is in the heart

Will always take it’s course

But do you recall


The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
had a very shiny nose. 
And if you ever saw him, 
you would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer 
used to laugh and call him names. 
They never let poor Rudolph 
join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say: 
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"" 

Then all the reindeer loved him 
as they shouted out with glee, 
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, 
you'll go down in history! ",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,1996

To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Beneath the steeple all the people have begun

Popping in the wind like an angry cannon ball

Come all you old time cowboys
And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long
Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo.

Well I found myself in Griffin
In eighteen eighty-three
When a man by the name of Creagho
Come a'walkin' up to me
Sayin ""How do you do young fella
And how'd you like to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo"".

Well me being out of work right then
To that drover I did say
""My goin' out on the buffalo range
Depends upon the pay
But if you pay good wages,
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
On the range of the Buffalo"".

Well yes I pay good wages
And transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me
Until the season's through
But if you do get homesick
And you try and run away
You'll starve to death out on the trail
And you'll also lose your pay

Well with all the flatterin' talkin'
He signed up quite a train
Some ten or twelve in number
Of able bodied men
And our trip it was a pleasant one
Through all New Mexico
Until we crossed Pease River
On the range of the buffalo

It was there our pleasures ended
And our troubles all begun
A lightnin' storm come up on us
And made the cattle run
We got full of the stickers
On the cactus that did grow
And the outlaws waited to pick us off
In the hills of Mexico

Well the working season ended
But the drover would not pay
He said ""You spent your money boys
You're all in debt to me"".
But the cowboys never put much stock
In a thing like a bankrupt law
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach
On the range of the buffalo.

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the paper was all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful pray'rs were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
While swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd never dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war.

Has been too long, too long

So have another sip I think you need to loosen up

You're losing all the people and you haven't played a note
You can be somebody can be anyone you want

Didn't wanna get too into it nor get too intimate,
Tried to back off, but that back-off,
She's gorgeous, 5 ft 4 and 3 quarters,
Half Italian half Japanese, she can make cars crash in them jeans,
But she's so much more than a body, she's perfect,
I knew it would hurt but it was worth it, 'cause when it was working
Weren't nothing like it and to be honest it's as in love that I've been ever!

I never felt a love like this before, so is it I feel so insecure,
Fuck it I'm taking her dive, no more linking I'm making her mine but
Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here.
Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here.

It's been a couple of months, we've grown so tight so quick,
I just might let you in see, I'm quite closed off,
I got a lot of pain inside, that's why I get high till I dose off but,
I change in time at least I hope to, cause it feels so right when I hold you,
I wanna get inside I wanna know you, there's so much of I, I wanna show you
And though I'm scared to, I'm prepared to, trust you as long as you share too.
Lucked up, both loved up, but little did we know we were both fucked up
The more open we were the more vulnerable, but after a while weren't fun at all
It got deep and proceeded to change, I needed you and you needed the space
What a waste.

Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor

I'm gonna wipe out your mama if she puts me on now, honey

'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare, I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse

Well, there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out, honey, watch out, honey
Watch the things you do

Long haired [Incomprehensible], well, they look so fine
Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine
But I don't think those [Incomprehensible] really do mind now, honey
I still don't know why you hate me so
A little bit of fun never stopped no show
Well, I just want to loosen up my soul now, honey

He packed up his emotional baggage
And left me in the dust

I want more than I can take

Staring back at the trash magazines
Martians say earth girls are lonely
Well that's no news to me

In the parking lot I saw two cowboys
Fighting for a handicapped space
So what is a girl to do now boys
To make sense of this place

There's too much wrong in the world tonight
Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
And lie down with an innocent man, oh lie down with an innocent man

I don't need a strong man's protection
No I don't want a faithless man's love
Just a little respect and affection
Would be more than enough

'Cause I've been shot down by love's aimless arrows
And I've shot a few wild ones myself
But these days the choices are narrow
And you've got to aim well

Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
And lie down with an innocent man, oh lie down with an innocent man

Looking out for just one honest face
All the noise out there won't matter
If I can trust in just one quiet place

I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights

Sherrié Austin,"Your love was reckless baby I fell deep
Easy to hold but you were hard to keep
You were a heartache waiting to be
We took off flying down a dead end street

I never knew that love could hurt so bad
When you said goodbye with a tip of your hat
I watched you leaving across the welcome mat
And though I know that you ain't coming back

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
Falling from my eyes
I'll get over you I'll get by
One solitary tear at a time

Little things remind me that you're gone
The mailman still brings all your catalogs
The radio just keeps on playing our songs
But I tell myself that I have to be strong

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
Falling from my eyes
I'll get over you I'll get by
One solitary tear at a time

I'll get over you
I'll get by
One solitary tear

And made to love a man

Are buried in the sand

Slowly drifting
Further and further apart

We gotta hold on to each other

And you can only say so much with the slamming of a door
Maybe with a kiss
And a little forgiveness

In a frame on a mantle in a house
Piece by piece they put their world together

He sweats 9 to 5 with big dreams in his head
There's too much month at the end of the money
Wolf's at the door and the bankbook's in the red
I guess every fairy tale has a monster underneath the bed

Whatever happened to the Prince and Cinderella

What happens after happy- ever-after

He phones in messages to say he's working late
So hard to find a tender moment together
So many modern ways to miscommunicate
Guess every honey moon has and experation date

May be faded and worn
But when illusions die
True love will cary on

Sherrié Austin,"The rain has stopped fallin', there's a hush in the air
You can feel the night holding its breath
We've stripped our defenses, our souls are laid bare
Let's put our fears to the test

Come to me now with a love unafraid
Lay your heart down and stay
Leave the window open, don't pull the shades
Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid

The moonlight is chasin', the shadows away
We got no more secrets to hide
So don't fight this feeling, don't be ashamed
Of the need we've been keepin' inside

Come to me now with a love unafraid
Lay your heart down and stay
Leave the window open, don't pull the shades
Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid

Make no promises, tell no lies
And don't close your eyes

Come to me now with a love unafraid
Lay your heart down and stay
Leave the window open, don't pull the shades
Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid
Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid, ooh

Why were we smiling, I just can't seem to recall
Remind me
Do you see this wedding band
Wasn't it once worth more than just gold on my hand
Remind me

Chorus:
I don't care who's right or wrong
But my memory of love is almost gone
Won't you take me in your arms
And remind me
You criticize and accuse
Oh, but honey you've had amnesia too
Kiss me like you used to do
And remind me

It's a short walk to that door
But didn't we have something good
That's still worth fighting for
Remind me

(chorus)

How did we end up this way
Me against you
In love one is never to blame
It always takes two
Do you remember, my dear
The first time we made love, come over here
And let me remind you.

Sherrié Austin,"In a pair of faded coveralls and her mama's old high heels
She wobbles up and takes a shaky bow
She smiles a little smile that hides her missing baby tooth
And she manages to sing that way some how

Why she starts with 'Delta dawn' and goes into 'Amazing grace'
Then squints her eyes and sings 'I fought the law'
And when the wind comes sweeping in and ripples through the corn
To her it sounds exactly like applause

She's just singing to the scarecrow, dancing through the fields
With a kitten and bo-jingles in her arms
Trying to let the whole world know how wonderful it feels
To be here on this South Kentucky Farm
Singing to the scarecrow

She looks his patchwork eyes and looks into his heart
And tries to find a song to ease his pain
And she sings 'Faded love' until the sunny sky grows dark
And his tears are falling in the somber rain

And she's singing to the scarecrow, dancing through the fields
With a kitten and bo-jingles in her arms
Trying to let the whole world know how wonderful it feels
To be here on this South Kentucky Farm
Singing to the scarecrow

Well, now that little girl is grown, she's in a band out on the road
She left those Green Kentucky fields behind
But she sings herself back home when she's at the microphone
And she smiles that funny smile and shuts her yes

Yeah, she's still singing to the scarecrow

Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war.
This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night.
I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.

Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own:
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?

Tell me God, do you remember the wishes that she made,
As she blew out the candles on her last birthday cake?
She wants to ride a pony when she'd big enough.
She wants to marry her Daddy when she's all grown up.

Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own:
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?

Lord, don't you know she's my angel
You got plenty of your own
And I know you hold a place for her
But she's already got a home
Well I don't know if you're listenin'
But praying is all that's left to do
So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too

And it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
Lord, I know once you've made up your mind,
There's no use in beggin'.
So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways,
And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven.

Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,

And he heard their mournful cry.

With sweat,

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Sherry Bryce,"When the years show in our faces from the thoughtless hand of time
And our youth is just a mem'ry to revive
(We'll spend many happy hours thumbing through the past desires
And we'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life)
But every day we live we add a mem'ry and we store it in the corner of our minds
And when life's fire is just a dying ember
We'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life

When we know our days are numbered that we live on borrowed time
Our hands will search the darkness to entwine
(Then we'll spend our last few hours looking through our treasured mammons
And we'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life)
For every day we live,
We'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life",Back to Life,1972
Sherry Bryce,"Now life is filled with ups and downs and we both had our share
And everytime I slip and fall you're still there to care

And we'll go on through life together living and learning)

Let's call all mistakes we've made learning learning
Reach out together and the love light's still burning
And we'll go on through life together living and learning

Well everytime old trouble comes a knocking on our door
We stand and face it hand in hand like everytime before

Sherry Taylor,"The love bug done bit me, 
Didn't mean for him to get me,
Woo, get up in the morning 
And I'm filled with desire,
No, no, I can't stop the fire,
Love is real live wire,
Oo, it's a burning sensation,
Far beyond imagination.
 
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart, tearing it all apart,
Just an itching in my heart, 
And, baby, I can't scratch it.
 
Keeps me sighing, oo
Keeps me yearning, 
No mama can't help me,
No daddy can't help me
I've been bitten by the love bug,
And I need some information 
o help me out of this situation,
Now, when you're ill you take a pill,
When you're thirsty, drink your fill,
What you gonna do, oh yeah, 
when love gets a hold, a hold on you,
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart, 
And, baby, I can't scratch it.
 
Love is a nagging irritation, 
Causing my heart complication,
Love is a growing infection,
And I don't know the correction, 
Got me rocking and a-reeling,
And I can't shake the feeling.
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,
tearing it all apart,
Just an Itching in my heart,
And, baby, I can't scratch it.

Sherry Williams,"Cold rain running down the front of my shirt
I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt
Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street
She's straddling the shifter in my front seat
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak
The deck's stacked
So put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back

We're making night tracks through the blazing rain
Blowin' pistons, workin' the fast lane
Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash
Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash
There's nothing to lose
It's a bad break but baby we're backed
Tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back
We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain
We made it through the heart of a hurricane
We tore it apart and put it together again

Well angel, won't you believe in love for me
C'mon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street
We'll move with the city in the dark
You got to walk, it talk, it in your heart
There's nothin' to lose it's a heartache

Just friends, but not like before

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

High in the sky up above

Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

You're out of my heart

Sherwin Linton,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,2006

Call it the chance of a lifetime
Call it the deepest blue
Season two, a change in the storyline
Well I'm not afraid of what lies ahead
I remember something that someone said
""If you never think, you never change your mind""

So I'll be looking my best tonight if I lose the fight
Or fall asleep for the final time
You can come with me but you'll be cutting in line
So listen to me yeah

I can make you feel alive (alive)
And if the world is racing by tonight
We'll watch it run
And even if the end's begun, its fine
We can walk across our line
With our hopes and spirits high
Who knows what we'll find together on the other side

Oh my love, you think that its over
But I think it's just begun
And season one was a tap on your shoulder
Well I'm not afraid of what lies ahead
I remember something that someone said
""If you never blink, you never feel your eyes""

But you'll be trying your best tonight not to lose the fight
Don't fall asleep, even close your eyes
But to your surprise love, the whole whole tunnel is light
With walls of the purest white

I'm, alive, tonight

I can make you feel alive (alive)
And if the world is racing by tonight
We'll watch it run
And even if the end's begun, its fine
We can walk across our line
With our hopes and spirits high
Who knows what we'll find together on the other side

When narrow walls can seem so wide
I guess its not for us to decide

I've been running all around this empty town
Where the brightest blues and greens just turn to brown
But it feels new, because I'm so in love with you

Making sense of all that you left behind
When I arrange it into columns and lines
I always think it's adding up, but it never does
So in the morning maybe I'll be alright
And through the day I'll prepare for the fight
With a fever on a Saturday night
Cause this is giving me the shakes and butterflies, oh

And if you don't stop running you can never breathe
When everything you want is everything you see
But when it comes to decision baby, him or me
Well I hope you can feel the need

What made you an alley cat scratching me?
You dig deep with your nails and flash your teeth
And run off to where your next big meal could be
What made you an alley cat scratching me?
You dig deep with your nails and flash your teeth
And run off because you must be tired of me
Run off because you must be tired of me

And there's a scene I will always replay
At the moment when my hand touched your face
I could see your eyes turning away
But I've been standing my ground with you babe

And if you don't stop running you can never breathe
When everything you want is everything you see
But when it comes to decision baby, him or me
Well I hope you can feel the need

What made you an alley cat scratching me?
You dig deep with your nails and flash your teeth
And run off to where your next big meal could be
What made you an alley cat scratching me?
You dig deep with your nails and flash your teeth
And run off because you must be tired of me
Run off because you must be tired of me

And now I fall in love with somebody everyday
As they step aside when I'm walking by, or smile at something I say
But I promised you it would never get in the way
Of stability but the joke's on me
Cause you were the one who got carried away
Oh, you got carried away
Well he carried you away, oh
Carried you away, oh
Carried you away
Carried you away

For you to be calling, calling, calling

And I can lay between the covers
Remember how I loved another

'cause in the glimmer of your eye
I begin to see myself in a different light

And I've been spending too much time in California
Where your feelings change but seasons never do
And in my dream last night I felt a storm was coming
But awoke to sunny skies of baby blue

And I call her up to let her go today
For a moment thought it easier then being away
But through the tangled thread the needle finds a way
And I'm asking her to stay

And I've been spending all my time composing letters
To a girl who lives a thousand miles away
But writing never takes the place of living
And I need her arms, I need her smile again

And she called me up to let me go today
For a moment thought it easier than being away
But through the tangled thread the needle finds a way
And I'm asking her to stay

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?

Tonight I'm staring at the moonlight
Tonight I'm wondering how this could've felt so right
And I could say it was a good time
But I can hardly say a thing
He's got you right where he wants you
Right where he wants you

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to

And will you still be feeling alright
In the morning with the sun creeping through the blinds?
And will you say it was a good time?
And you will you tell him anything?
He's got you right where he wants you
Right where he wants you

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to
He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to

And I've been away for far too long it seems
And this new group of friends is making me, ready again to leave
I'm ready again to leave

",Middle of the Night,2007
Sherwood,"This room's been dusted
And it's covered in prints from 
The month you spent with me.
And I've cataloged it,
Arranged the report with a chapter every week
And I've studied sleepless
Biting my nails and grinding my teeth.

And I think I've had it,
But that makes two of us,
'Cause you've had it with me.

And here in the meantime,
I'm a fly on the wall, and glued to the action.
A twist in the plotline,
A demand for a call, the loss of attraction.

And I'll tell you the worst part:
You're exactly the way that I thought you would be
So I'll stay for the last call
'Cause I'd move away, but I'm never ready to leave.
Whoa, whoa.
Well I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.

This house is haunted
But not in the way that you've always heard it said
No dusty attic
No razor teeth making camp beneath your bed.

But I've heard them walking late at night
The twins of confusion and regret
And they share ths stories of things that I have done
That I'd rather just forget.

Here in the meantime,
I'm a fly on the wall, and glued to the action.
A twist in the plotline,
A demand for a call, the loss of attraction.

And I'll tell you the worst part:
You're exactly the way that I thought you would be
So I'll stay for the last call
'Cause I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.

So this is how it feels to be 24
A thief without a key to an open the door
Just peering through the window
For any clue,
Or anything explaining a part of you.

I guess the real question is, I don't know,
Is, why I am afraid of letting go?
Why am I afraid of letting go?

Here in the meantime,
I'm a fly on the wall, and glued to the action.
A twist in the plotline,

This is the easy life
This is the simple life baby
And you maybe just what I
Have always been searching for
A light through an open door darling
But you're guarding it all night

I will whisper a song in your ear
Of the things you've been missing my dear
If you remember the tune
It's all I can do
Just remember I wrote it for you

And I carry an open box
Of rusted and broken locks, slowly
Can you show me where to lie?
Cause I'm tired as I can be
My legs aren't a part of me darling
Let us go then, you and I, through the night

I will whisper a song in your ear
Of the things you've been missing my dear
If you remember the tune
It's all I can do
Just remember I wrote it for you

I will whisper a song in your ear

The warmth of the sheets in my bed.

A warm arrival never left so cold.

Don't blink, don't close your eyes,
But most of all don't apologize.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

with magic and move a mountain.

Is the eagle ever truly tame,
Given just a little time,
I know that you'll find a way.

The vision of you in my life

I will be faithful,
but how can I make a promise
to a place I've never been?

Something has taken me off,
and I don't know if I will survive.
I believe that everything
I'll ever need is here by the roadside.

How can you fly,
keeping heaven in sight,
blinded by the light of day?

Given just a little time,
I know that I'll find a way

I would do anything for you,
Listen with all of my spirit,
for ecstasy calling,
You know I believe,
Cause all I have seen,

One beat at a time,
Where are we going,
I just don't know yet,
How will we make it,

Seems everyone's made a prison of love,
But if anybody can escape,

Room after empty room

But under a different moon

In the longest days, in the darkest night
Down the longest road, there's a presence of light
But I hear a voice that calls me
It's love's name I'll call in the end

I've walk in and out of the fire
Between truth and lies
Now how many children watch
While one child cries
Tear down these walls
And watch while our souls are freed

To drown in this endless sea

Mercy come rain down on me

The house set to swing 
I lay in my bed 
And listen to everything 

'Cause Leo's in rare form tonight 
His trombone sings so sweet 
This is the room 
Where they all come to meet 

He said 
I do what I can 
I live for the moment 
And that's who I am 
Yeah that's who I am

If we could freeze moments in time 
We all would 
But I do what I can

Downstairs he's playing Kenton 
The Magnavox sighs 
But oh how the music has changed 
In all of our lives 

He says ""nobody listens 
To modern jazz"" 
And I'll never have what those guys have 

He says 
I do what I can 
I work for a living 
And that's who I am 
Yeah that's who I am 

And it's good to be alive 
But everything's different since Leo died 
I do what I can 

Is this the end of the modern world 
What could it mean for a young girl 
Who sees the pain on his face 
He does what he can 

The procession on the TV screen 
What could it possibly mean for a man 
who's come this far just to turn around 
Could there still be life in Kenton's swing 

With the Kennedys gone and everything 
Those sad rows of houses with their optimistic colors 
Democrat grandparents and draft-dodging brothers 
Riots down the street and discontented mothers 
We do what we can 

Downstairs it's quiet 
Less alive somehow 
Somehow he was everything that I am now 

And he says 
I do what I can 
I work for a living

He says he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there but the brochure looks nice

Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low,
These are the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

He's got a daughter he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life

If God be willing

And swallow everything it meets

Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
Oh why we waited til so late
Was there no oil to excavate

No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate

Of melting in the heat of love

No arms around me, to pull me away, away from you

Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me too?

Like a moth to a flame, you're drawn to me with tender chains
You wrap me up so tight, and hold me all the night

Who's the stranger come and gone, statues crying in the lawn
The fountain's frozen tears, bring back those years

Did you think you loved me, and do you want me now like you did back then
No moon above me, could make me feel this way, feel this way again

Indian summer, I remember you
Indian summer, do you think of me too?

Where do the seasons go when you let them slip away
Now the winds have changed from hot to cold today

Hardly a single day goes by

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica
Boulevard.

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar

And he likes every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out - and he's watching
THE BOTTLES OF BUD as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads.

[Chorus]
All I Wanna Do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I Wanna Do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I Wanna Do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica
Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours. The day and the night
And the car wash too, the matches and the Buds
And the clean and dirty cars, the sun and the moon.

[Chorus]
All I Wanna Do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I Wanna Do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I Wanna Do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica

Sheryl Crow,"It's obvious the trouble we're in 
When your father pulls up in a Mercedes Benz 
He says he just happened to be in the neighborhood 
But before he leaves he slips the landlord the rent 

You say  ""It's just a question of eliminating obstacles"" 
As you throw your dinner out the kitchen door 
You say  ""I know how you try"" 
But honey  let's eat out tonight 

[Chorus] 
No one said it would be easy 
But no one said it'd be this hard 
No one said it would be easy 
No one thought we'd come this far 

You can't seem to ever fold up a shirt 
I bring it up and you think I'm a jerk 
But I think we're here to stay 
I can't imagine it any other way

Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man? 

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave 

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man? 

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Will you be strong enough to be my man?

I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave",Strong Enough [Single Edit],1996

Cause I don't want to hear you say
That you've got worries on your shoulder
Well, I'd love to say they'd up and go away

I know that you ain't cryin'
But that don't mean that you don't feel
Deep inside you might be dying
That may be the only thing that's ever real

[Chorus]
It's a reach around jerk in a button-down shirt
Talking sweet to keep all the little people happy
When the talk is cheap, the shit gets deep
Better face reality that everybody's had a bad day or two
They don't treat you like the way you think they should
So you lick your bitter wounds, turn and blame the government
Establishment, hide your head so no one sees you when you're down 

Wake me up when you are over
Let me know how long it took
If you ever need my sympathy
Honey, here's how deep you're gonna have to look

I know when you get older
You'll learn the art of how to please
But right now you're just getting colder
And my love is gonna bring you to your knees

And if you need me, I'll be here

Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel

Maybe I'll be back someday

Oh baby don't go
Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so, pretty baby
Please don't go

I bought at the second hand store
The way this old town laughs at me
I just can't take it no more

Said she can't stay

Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so, pretty baby

I waved goodbye to all my friends 
I packed my car and headed to LA 
I gave away all my loose ends

To want to go back home again 
I left my universe standing there 
Holding the hand of my best friend 

And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you 
It's one more dusty rose about to turn 
I'll see you when I reach New Mexico 
If I'm in the mood to crash and burn 

I wrote a letter that I never mailed 
I rehearsed a dialogue in my head 
In case you ever wanted to track me down 
I'll take my cell phone to bed

And let a mack truck leave her there for dead 
Just because her lover split the scene

That you don't care for me anymore.

It's 6 AM and I'm alone.

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending,
To the bad day I was just beginning.
When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake.

Your friends are sorry for me.
They watch you pretend to adore me.
But I am no fool to this game.

Now here comes your secret lover,

Until your guilt goes up in flames.

When you go, all I know is you're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake.

Well maybe nothing lasts forever,
Even when you stay together.
I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way.

That I ever loved?

When the dust in the fields has flown 
And the youngest of hearts has grown 
And you doubt you will ever be free 
Honey  don't bail on me 

River is wide and oh so deep and it winds and winds around 
I dream we're happy in my sleep, floating down and down and down 
And the tide rushes by where we stand 
And the earth underneath turns to sand 

And we're waiting for someone to see

Lovely and fine, I could've been, laying down in the palm of his hand 

Laying down in the palm of his hand

Staying down in the palm of his hand 
In the morning you wait for the sun
