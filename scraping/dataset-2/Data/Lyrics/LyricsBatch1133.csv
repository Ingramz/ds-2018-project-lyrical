Bill Monroe,"Makes no diff'rence now what kind of life fate hands me;
I'll get along without you now, that's plain to see.
I don't care what happens next, for I'll get by somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

It was just a year ago when I first met you;
I learned to love you, and I thought you'd love me too.
But that's all in the past, and I'll forget somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through.
I don't blame myself; I'm sure I can't blame you.
There was something had to happen, and it happened somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

After all is said and done, I'll soon forget you,
Although I know that it will be so hard to do.
Let things happen as they will, and I'll get by somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.



",It Makes No Difference Now,1991
Bill Monroe,"In the state of West Virginia among the peaceful rolling hills
There I met a mountain maid with eyes of blue
Golden hair so soft and curly and her lips were like the dew
She was the queen of West Virginia and her name was Linda Lou

Linda Lou my Linda Lou can't you hear me calling you
Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
Can't you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou

I recall the night I met her how I held her hand in mine
I recall the night we kissed and bid adieu
Many miles may separate us if I should cross the ocean blue
My heart is still in West Virginia with my darling Linda Lou",Linda Lou,1991
Bill Monroe,"Oh yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
She's a courtin' some other man

Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
A shinin in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky

Last time a saw little Maggie
She was standin' on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four strapped around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain
Little Maggie's gonna dance for daddy
Listen to that old banjo ring

Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty girls were made for lovin'
Little Maggie was made for mine",Little Maggie,1991
Bill Monroe,"They tell me that you are going away
What makes you want to leave?
You gave me your love and you gave me your vow
Now you're leavin' me here to grieve

Live and let live, don't break my heart 
Don't leave me here to cry
I never could live if we should part 
Tell me you don't mean goodbye

Stayed awake last night and I walked the floor
What makes you treat me so?
Live and let live, don't break my heart
I don't want to live if you go

You're the one who's made me love you so 
You're the one who's makin' me cry
You're the one who'd break my heart if you go
Tell me you don't mean goodbye",Live and Let Live,1991
Bill Monroe,"I'm growing old and feeble and I can't work on more
My rusty bladed hoe I've laid to rest
My mama and my papa they are sleeping side by side
And their spirits now are roaming with the blessed

Oh, the chimney's falling down and the roof is all caved in
Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

Oh I ain't got long to stay here, what little time I've got
I want to rest content while I remain
'Til death shall call this dog and me to find a better home
Than that little old log cabin in the lane",Log Cabin in the Lane,1991
Bill Monroe,"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said ""Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die""
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones",Long Black Veil,1991
Bill Monroe,"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain 
And planted some pines in the sand 
Every day I looked their way 
But just couldn't understand 

Why they never grew like I thought they should do 
I just couldn't understand why 
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through 
And today I just happened by 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I bet you wouldn't know me now

I'll never forget the morning I left 
The hum of the bees in the hay 
The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today 

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch 
Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone 
There waiting to join me in the shade 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs",Tall Pines,1991
Bill Monroe,"We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
That there was nothing we could do",There Was Nothing We Could Do,1991
Bill Monroe,"Now as I sigh the hours away
I think of love of yesterday
Now I know she's gone away
She's in heaven so they say

 Will the angels tell her for me
 That my love will never die
 Someday I'll walk along beside her
 On that golden way up there

Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay

Each night I think about you dear
I wonder if you'll hold me then
When I meet you up in heaven
We'll have life eternal there
",Thinking About You,1991
Bill Monroe,"There was a time when I thought of no other
And we sang our own love's refrain
And out hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything

And when you left me, my poor heart was broken
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
Yes time changes everything

The time has passed and I have forgot you
Mother nature does wonderful things
I guess it is true for me and for you
Cause time changes everything

Oh you can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

So good luck to you, may God bless you
I can't say we won't love again
You have gone your way and I'll go mine
Cause time changes everything",Time Changes Everything,1991
Bill Monroe,"Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh!
Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?

Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
Oh!
Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?

Were you there when they pierced him in the side?
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?
Oh!
Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?

Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
Oh!
Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?",Were You There When They Crucified My Lord,1991
Bill Monroe,"Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
Maybe we can live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

The castles we built of dreams together
Are the sweetest stories ever told
But in my dreams they live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

Bill Monroe,"I want to thank my Jesus for the way that I feel

I wanna sing it and shout it and let the people know
That I'm saved by His mercy and I'm ready to go

Doc said, ""McKinley I can't find the cause
You're bound to die, you're bound to die""

Doc told the horse, he'd throw down his rein

When the Savior will welcome you home
Will you be prepared for the journey to Heaven
On the great ship that carries God's chosen ones home

[Chorus]
Oh the water's so deep on the river of Jordan
And the light shines so bright from Heaven above
And the midnight has passed a new day is dawning
Oh the great ship will anchor in the 'Harbor of Love'

Won't you ask Him to show you the way
Fall down on your knees in a chapel next Sunday
And meet all your friends in Heaven some day

Bill Monroe,"I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole

 Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
 Let us tell Him all about our troubles
 He will hear our famished cry
 He will answer by and by
 Now when you feel a little prayer turning
 And you know the little talk with Jesus makes it right

Sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
And then the cloud about me hides the light of day
The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way

I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and and night
I go to Him in prayer He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Makes everything right",Just a Little Talk With Jesus,1991

Bill Monroe,"One night while out for a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine

On her face, there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
With hair so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band

We strolled down the street together
In my pocket, she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band

Well, I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
What a diamond that was worth ten grand

Well, at night when bed-time was ringin'
Standing close to the bar
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out on the ocean of stars

They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I'm an innocent man
But the guilty one, now she lies dying
The girl in the blue velvet band

Well, I'll be out in a year and I'm leaving
And I'll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band

I want to kiss you both then go""

In our home we'll happy be,
Down beside where the waters flow,
On the banks of the Ohio.""

I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
An' watched her as she floated down.

Returnin' home between twelve and one,
Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;
I'd killed the girl

There's somethin' you can tell 'er;

Will she stray from her frolic for a day
Will she lie on the rug beside my bed 
Like she did before I went away

What will Thomas, the old gardener do 
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
The fairest one that lies around the tree

He said it was the wind that brought 'em there

Keep him though blind and older he grows

To thee when thou art far away

But you have proven untrue to me

Bill Monroe & His Bluegrass Boys,"Oh, I'm sending a prayer up to Heaven
On a beautiful cloud you see
So you will know that I want you
In my beautiful memories and dreams

Come back to me in my dreams love
Come back to me in sweet dreams
I'm heartbroke I'm sad and I'm weary
Come back to me in my dreams

When the bright moon shines up in Heaven
And the beautiful stars are a'gleam
It seems that you are so near me
But yet it is only a dream

It seems I'll never more see you
Till we meet in Heaven it seems
But I hold you close to my heart love
In my beautiful memories and dreams

Bill Monroe & His Bluegrass Boys,"One night while out for a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine

On her face, there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
With hair so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band

We strolled down the street together
In my pocket, she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band

Well, I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
What a diamond that was worth ten grand

Well, at night when bed-time was ringin'
Standing close to the bar
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out on the ocean of stars

They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I'm an innocent man
But the guilty one, now she lies dying
The girl in the blue velvet band

Well, I'll be out in a year and I'm leaving
And I'll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band

In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mother were called to heaven
I's left in this world all alone

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot in my memory

And drink my coffee from a can;

It never snows or rains.

Out on the western plains.

But they will be back soon.

Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You're drifting to far from the shore

Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)
Drifting too far from the shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today, let him show you the way
You're drifting to far from the shore

Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore

Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late
You're drifting to far from the shore

I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
That old sugar coated love is something I can't bite

You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love

You called me your sugar plum, your baby and your pet
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove
You sure had me fooled, babe, with that sugar coated love

Could be an all-night stand

Still she kissed me and I don't know why

The band plays loud to let the mourners grieve
The heart stays hidden in a rolled up sleeve
Empty pockets pay no dues

The rails may call, but the roads just sigh
Believe I'll give New Orleans one more try
with a spit shine on my walking shoes

Stand on the corner, trying to catch a break

",Harry's Last Call,2001
Bill Morrissey,"The July wind blew from the mountain
and threw a chill on the lake shore
The whitecaps danced around us
like they never have before
There ain't no room in this little town
No one to settle up the score
So we must live with what we both put down
just before we lost the war

My love for you has gone unspoken
Still you knew the words I'd say
Yet we stand here with both hearts broken
on this windy summer day
I can't find relief in the lies I told
but they came right from my core
I still believe one of us ran cold
just before we lost the war

I used to think that time was plenty
and time was all I knew
But it gets cut short for so many
It could be me; it could be you
There ain't no wind that can blow the truth
back to where it stood before
And I couldn't change it in a cold phone booth
just before we lost the war

So say goodbye and fare-thee-well
Tell everyone I'm doing fine
For as far as I can tell
I'm just ten years down the line
What we give we can't get back
and we always ask for more
We could not retreat; we could not attack
just before we lost the war

",Just Before We Lost the War,2001
Bill Morrissey,"The road was the color of the road
and the sky was the color of the sky
And the heat was the breath of your kiss
when you waited far too long to sigh
Your stories were just stories
Your love not even that
Though you knew of my past glories
when I could win a heart when I tipped my hat
Your beauty was just beauty
though many men were spared
And like the others you saw through me
But I always came prepared

There were drops of white on a southern dawn
that made the cotton look so real
But there was nothing upon nothing
on that long road to Mobile

You held me close on your back porch
but I've been held before
Where rich girls knew what silence was
and what a kiss was for
You promised me undying love
as the sun broke through the trees
You promised me the stars above
as you fell to your knees
Well, a promise is a promise
when you cannot fake the lie
When you give your heart in the morning light
there's no Sunday goodbye

But the world always begins anew
when the summer church bells peal
And there was nothing upon nothing
on that long road to Mobile

Jesus lived and Jesus died
and it was just to make you sweet
And they nailed him down and Mary cried,
""All love is incomplete.""
Still I believe the soldier
who gambled big that day
Who traded clothes for a crown of thorns
to guide him on his way
""A crown of thorns,"" his wife scoffed
""That's all you've brought today.
You've just returned with a crown of thorns
and you call it a day's pay?""

A crown is just a crown
and a deal is just a deal
And there was nothing upon nothing
on that long road to Mobile

Alabama turns it back
when the air's too thick to breathe
And there was no air in that shotgun shack
when I knew I should leave
I'll leave alone the way I came
as the maid undoes your stays
I had a race I thought was run
but now I see it goes two ways
A destination holds no gold
It's all in the journey
So leaving and returning now 
It's all the same to me

When the sun burns every seed you plant
You cannot sell the yield
And there was nothing upon nothing
on that long road to Mobile

",Mobile,2001
Bill Morrissey,"Lock the door and say goodbye
There's new folks moving in
Leave the key in the mailbox now
and kiss me once again
Kiss me for the ones who say
all love comes to an end
Though we never let it go that way
we start alone again

Our years they ran in circles
It was a long and stormy ride
No pot of gold for the happy groom
No brass ring for the bride
Nothing but the two of us
and the promises we made
Love disappeared in a summer wind
so soft she could've stayed

Two stars hanging in the sky
behind a drifting cloud
And when two hearts must say goodbye
love cannot be proud
Love cannot take sides
or take a stand or answer why
Sometimes two hearts must fall away
no matter how they try

Moving day is over now
This house is just a shell
Say goodbye to the sights and sounds
we came to know so well
Your car is loaded to the roof
It's just the same as mine
There's no room for the dreams we had
I guess they stay behind

",Moving Day,2001
Bill Morrissey,"The church was cold and darkness
at the early morning Mass
Till the sun brought its own colors
to the figures in the stained glass
And they shown from a light
that came from so far away
It was a miracle to my young eyes
on St. Valentine's Day

The streets, they were bog iron
The air was cruel and thin
I could wrap my scarf around my neck
but something always found its way in
Like I wrap myself around you now
when there's nothing left to say
And I hold you like the miracle
of St. Valentine's Day

(Refrain:)
Just to hold you before the sunrise
when the world is just a darkened heart
and that heart is full of lies
'Cause I told you it ain't ever gonna go away
This miracle I feel in your arms
on St. Valentine's Day

Walk me out on the frozen lake
Put an end to all my fears
I can stand here if you can too
I can stand right here for years
With your arms around me
like it was always meant to be this way
When the miracle comes back one last time
on St. Valentine's Day

(Refrain)

",ST. Valentine's Day,2001
Bill Morrissey,"He was too old for that bar
but it was the only one around
And he needed a beer
So that's where he was found
He took an empty stool
amid the jocks and punks
He could take them all to school
when it came to being drunks

Miles from home again
He was overdrawn on luck
Hoping that tomorrow
they'd find that part for his truck
So he drank a beer, then two
as a rock band hit the stage
When all he wanted to do
was have a drink with folks his age

(Refrain:)
Then the beer it turned to whiskey
The barmaid ran a tab
You can hit freefall until last call
when you're traveling by cab

There were young girls in the mirror
with no trouble on their minds
As the picture became clearer
he stared ahead just to look behind
Then the band kicked off their first set
They wore their guitars well
There was anger, light and speed,
every whistle, every bell

They had smoke bombs, they had lasers
The singer banged his tambourine
But it's hard to play the music
when you're a pinball machine
Then the drummer took a lighter
and set fire to his sticks
as the barmaid squealed with laughter
and said, ""That's one of my favorite tricks.""

(Refrain)

As the whiskey took the driver's seat
he touched his wedding ring
He kept thinking of Chuck Berry,
Howlin' Wolf and B.B. King
Then the band it took a break
and it was possible to talk
As the barmaid poured a free one
she said, ""Don't they really rock?""

At first he had no words
so he drank his whiskey down
Then he slid off his barstool
and stood on shaky ground.
He said, ""That ain't rock'n'roll.
That's just Vaudeville plugging in.""
And she looked up and said,
""Ain't that the way it's always been?""

Will you take my hand?
Will you keep me there

Will you be my rose
in the morning true
when the nighttime fails
and the world begins anew?

Will you be my rose
when I'm gone away
in the sweet repose
at the end of the day?

When I'm all alone
and a cold wind blows
will you see my face?
Will you be my rose?

from sunrise to sunrise

will you touch my cheek, will you come along?

To another day

You're not too far from the bottom
and it's still so early in the day
She told me what she taught 'em
We're just halfway into autumn
But when winter comes, it's here to stay

and it hides
what will not go away

just to fool me
into thinking her way

which ones you'd see
They would stare through a film of cosmoline
and they were always trained
right on me

in a Ford Fairlane
parked beside a stand of hemlock trees
They were safe out of the rain
when he finally made his claim
and he didn't ask and didn't say please

There weren't nobody
on that mountain road
when you slide off deep into the snow
Now the night is getting cold
and has a very good hold
with no reason to ever let go

Your own Mother Earth wants to call you home
and protect you
from all harm
She's so lonely in the night
and if you only held her tight
there'll be no need for alarm

You never travel steerage
when you're in a Boston marriage
No matter what the people may say
You found yourself a lover
Drag her underneath the cover
and show her where the hound dogs bay

another shot of anisette
Adjust the seat in the Fairlane
You gave them what they want
in the finest restaurant
and you didn't cry or didn't name names

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,

To see us play our parts
We hoped you'd lend an ear
You hope we dress like tarts
But back stage we stand naked

All the make-up cleaned away
My poet sheds his pretty skin
And turns to face the day
And there's nothing to be done
No nothing to be said

Last night I felt immortal
This morning I feel dead
And the love that gave
Its blaze to my heart
Now brings a haze

Be careful, I'm an axe victim
Hung up on these silver strings
Like wings, like time machines
Like voices on the winds
We hit the road to Hull

Sad amps and smashed guitars
Played badly at The Duke
To almost no applause
But someone made it worthwhile

When shining with bright eyes
They gave me full attention
And took me by surprise
But today the feeling's gone

No, faded like a ghost
Last night I saw the future
This morning there's no hope
And the words that I sung so clear
Are now clouded by my tears

Hung up on these silver strings
Like sails, like seagulls cries
Like church bells in the night

All around his shoulders...

For an answer to the call for help 
I had written on the wall 

And the rain fell like jewels 
On the heads of all the fools 
Who wandered crazed with their souls ablaze for me... 

And the blessing of the hour 
Was the twilight and the tower 
With its golden bell form the bottom of the sea...

Where lovers slumbered 
Made a silver dance of such dust beneath the bed...

Oh, such a sad refrain
Feels like a thorn in the heart for me
Feels like I'm dying again

Like the nearly insane when the game is all done

Feels so dizzy underneath your open skies

My soul has vanished with the bird who flies so free
And the wings of change have spread themselves o'er me

I am waiting here for the tide to turn
And the pathways of the air to open
Will you meet me there
By the golden stairways to the clouds?

I am a changeling like the wind across the waves
Though in the end there will be nothing left to save
I will return one day with all the time you gave

Bill O'Connell,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I-I bought me a gittar a year ago

Or wherever they've been
'Cause they've got one thing in common, it's true
They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste
And let me tell ya' something, neither will you

Neither will you
Neither will you
Neither will you

Bill Payne,"The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend Kenny
We were close as any brothers than you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream and so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They said he crashed and burned
I know I'll never learn why any boy should die so young

We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now and he's gaining ground

[Chorus]
But it was long ago and it was far away, oh God it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank as he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone So
Many threats and fears, so many wasted years before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind and then he pulls me back

[Chorus]

There was a beauty living on the edge of town
And she always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said, Caution! Kids At Play!

Those were the rights of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage, she used my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared But I can see her rising up
Out of the back seat now Just like an angel rising up from a tomb

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x12]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

Bill Perkins,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

Bill Perkins,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1956
Bill Perkins,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me,1956
Bill Perkins,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Just friends, but not like before

Sweeter than the roses in May

Never were as blue as his eyes

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

Bill Perkins,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling [*],2006

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I’ll share.",Old Rugged Cross,1990

Bill Ramsey,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

See right through me
Like an X-ray

You're robbing a bank with a fake toy gun
You're captured in a bad TV rerun
You won the race against my one track mind
Standing in place the mountain I must climb

Die on the vine
Beautiful day
See right through me
Like an X-ray

I guess it was an Ordinary Time
Nothing special
Forget it nevermind",Like an X-Ray,2002
Bill Ricchini,"You dream in black and white
Sometimes a little red
But you can't sleep tonight
You just lie there instead

You're staring at the sky
Watching the colors change
The stars are in your eyes
But they're so far away

You close the door at night
And you fall into bed
And you turn out the light
And then you rest your head

But you don't fall asleep
At least not right away
You stay up watching the
Night turning into day",Like Falling Asleep,2002
Bill Ricchini,"I climb a mountain for you
I stay up here
I wait yes I wait for you
'Til you believe in our love

Using up my oxygen
Can you breath for me?
Freezing air is getting thin
Still you believe in our love 

I know that you were my mountain
I know that you were my peak
Washing your hands in the fountain
Breaking the fall with concrete","A Mountain, a Peak",2002
Bill Ricchini,"Sketch your face in crayon
Throw away the baton
The helium so heavy
All covered in confetti

Cuts and blisters
Rocks and scissors

Cuts and blisters
Waiting for your sister

On the six o'clock news
No one came to see you

Bill Ricchini,"No one is left at school
Everyone's gone home for the Christmas break
Chosen to stay behind
The request declined sleeping wide awake

Another undergrad looks so very sad
At the happy hour
Drunk at the mixer but I still miss her
(Wondering where you are)

News that I haven't heard
I forgot the words to my victory song
I went but I took too long
And if it's so right 

Why does it feel so wrong?
Think of me as a place
Like a warm embrace 
You can run into

Not like someone you know
But somewhere to go 
If you get cold

Memories have been erased
Brush the hair back from your face

When I was younger
I used to wander 
Through the open door
Now that I'm older

Weight on my shoulder
I want something more
Something real something true
I never told but I think you knew

Lend me a dirty look
I'm an open book
So long overdue

Goodbye
So long

Goodbye
So long

Goodbye
So long",Think of Me as a Place,2002

Dawn sat at the kitchen table drinking coffee

Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry

One place I may never go in my life again

Bill Robinson,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon

Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Bill Small,"When you've played and played forever
And you're bouncing more than ever
Just remember this rhyme
Every sunset fades away, every night becomes the day
Even Tiggers have to sleep some time

Even fish in the ocean
Stop their swimming motion
And drift with the tide through the night
Every birdie stops to rest
In a cozy little nest
To build up strength for tomorrow's flight

When you've played and played forever
And you're bouncing more than ever
Just remember this rhyme
Every sunset fades away, every night becomes the day
Even Tiggers have to sleep some time

Every elephant and lion go to bed without crying
Every Piglet, every Kanga, every Roo
So don't you hesitate, even bears hiberante
And they don't wake up until the winter's through

Even Tiggers start to yawn and fall asleep until the dawn
At night they only bounce in their dreams
The moon comes in to town as the sun settles down
On a cloudy soft bed, to rest it's peak

When you've played and played forever
And you're bouncing more than ever

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

And night after night, as strange as it seems,

Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo

The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old coyote howls

Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now

On the melodies with the high notes ringing

And we close in ten minutes.""  Now where shall I go?

Bill Staines,"I was born in the path of the winter wind
I was raised where the mountains are old
Their springtime waters came dancing down
And I remember the tales they told

The whistling ways of my younger days
Too quickly have faded on by
But all of their memories linger on
Like the light in a fading sky

River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song
Ever moving and winding and free
You rolling old river, you changing old river
Let's you and me, river, run down to the sea

I've been to the city and back again
I've been moved by some things that I've learned
Met a lot of good people and I've called them friends
Felt the change when the seasons turned

I've heard all the songs that the children sing
And listened to love's melodies
I've felt my own music within me rise
Like the wind in the autumn trees

River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song
Ever moving and winding and free
You rolling old river, you changing old river
Let's you and me, river, run down to the sea

Someday when the flowers are blooming still
Someday when the grass is still green
My rolling waters will round the bend
And flow into the open sea

So, here's to the rainbow that's followed me here
And here's to the friends that I know
And here's to the song that's within me now
I will sing it wherever I go

River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song
Ever moving and winding and free
You rolling old river, you changing old river
Let's you and me, river, run down to the sea

Just a gentle flower of a small-town girl.
You took my hand and we stepped to the music,
And with a single smile, you became my world.

And we'd rock for hours on your front porch chair.

And the brightest star I will ever know
Love's lasting light comes shining on and on

But we are here, you need not walk alone
To face, not fear each coming new unknown
Is the way to lift your wings
Child of mine, you are the sweetest song
And the greatest gift I will ever know

Child of mine, where spirits fly above
There is but one that belongs to you
So let it grow and it will thrive on love
For it is love that sees us through

You have the hopes this world is waiting for
You are my own but you are so much more
You are tomorrow on the wing, child of mine

That a man can't help but feel;
There a shadow growing longer now,
And nipping at my heels.
For I know that soon that old four-lane
That runs beneath my wheels
Will take me home to my sweet Wyoming home.
I headed down the road last summer
With a few old friends of mine.
They all hit the money, Lord,
I didn't make a time.
The entrance fees they took my dough,
And the travelin' took my time,
And now I'm headed home to my sweet Wyoming home.

Watch the moon smiling in the sky

A song of home, my sweet Wyoming home.

Well, the rounders they all wish you luck
When they know you're in a jam.
But your money's ridin' on the bull,
And he don't give a damn.
Well there's shows in all the cities,
The cities turn your heart to clay;
It takes all a man can muster
Just to try and get away.
And the songs I'm used to hearin'
Ain't the kind the jukebox plays,
And now I'm headed home to my sweet Wyoming home.

Watch the moon smiling in the sky
And hum a tune, a prairie lullaby.

You know I've always loved the ridin',
There ain't nothin' quite the same,
And another year may bring the luck
Of winning all the game.
There's a magpie on the fencerail,
And he's callin' out my name,
And he calls me home to my sweet Wyoming home.

Here in the dawn
You got me listenin' to your song once again.
I love how it climbs and it hangs upon the wind.
Here in the dawn
You got me dreamin' to your song once again.
We all get to dreamin' now and then
So that's all right, coyote, my old friend.
Cho: How come you call so lonesome?
 How come you sound so blue?
 Is there somethin' inside
 That you just can't hide?
 Has somethin' come over you?
 That's all right, we all get lonesome too.
Here in the dawn
You got me listenin' to your song once again;
I love how it climbs and it hangs upon the wind.

Who will walk her tonight out in the heather?
Who will laugh away the teardrop in her eye?
She wants someone to love her forever,
But every new love only brings another lie.
Cho. 1:
 Empty winds, you hear her say
 Fickle winds, they shift away
 And I don't need him in my life for I can fly .
 But who will walk her tonight out in the heather?
 And who will laugh away the teardrop in her eye?
Who will smile with him when photographs are yellow,
And share his memories when they're flowers in the snow?
Who will know his mind when all the words are hollow,
And help him face the things he never seems to know?
Cho. 2:
 It's the road, you hear him say,
 It's the road and it's my way
 And I don't need her in my life, now let me go
 But who will smile with him when photographs are yellow
 And share his memories when they're flowers in the snow?

Bill Staines,"All the city lights, they burn outside our window
With the fleeing of an autumn afternoon;
I'll she'd a tear if I look down upon our river
Feeling close and knowing I'll be going soon.

I grew lonesome on the road
Until I met you here that night
We talked and drank some wine
And I was blinded in your light,
But there's a lady in Montana
And I love her, so I must be going home

I should have kept on going when I had the mind to;
I should have left you here so many times before.
Now your eyes reflect a face that's quite unknowing
If this pain inside is worth the open door.

But the highway's ringing clear,
And the morning sun is low
Blue November winds are blowing,
I must leave before the snow
Cause there's a lady in Montana
And I love her, so I must be going home.

There were many times I wanted to forget her
In the early morning hours here with you,
But my heart, it lies among the Rocky Mountains
With a lady there who's always been so true.

I could hold you here forever,
I could try and find a way
We could spend our time together,
But it's morning, and I pray
That there's a lady in Montana
And I love her, so I must be going home.",I Must Be Going Home,1998

Shine on your children below;
Singing, Shine, shine, Liverpool light

Three months ago April I left her with child
A child that was mine sure as she.
But she'd not complain, for she's gentle and mild
And it's her that I'm longing to see.

With her arms wrapped around me so warm.

Shine on your children below;
Singing, Shine, shine, Liverpool light

And her footsteps they run to the door.
Then I'll lift up my glass, and for all men to see,
I will vow to go sailing no more.

I'll stretch my green ribbon and I never will sleep.

All the waste, all the sham, all the haste
And plain old bad taste

Sidewalk Santy Clauses are much, much, much too thin
They're wearing fancy rented costumes, false beards and big fat phony grins
And nearly everybody's standing round holding out their empty hand or tin cup
Gimme gimme gimme gimme, gimme gimme gimme
Fill my stocking up
All the way up
It's a time when the greedy give a dime to the needy
Blue Christmas, all the paper, tinsel and the fal-de-ral
Blue Xmas, people trading gifts that matter not at all
What I call
Fal-de-ral
Bitter gall, Fal-de-ral

Lots of hungry, homeless children in your own backyards
While you're very, very busy addressing twenty zillion Christmas cards
Now, Yuletide is the season to receive and oh, to give and ahh, to share
But all you December do-gooders rush around and rant and rave and loudly blare
Merry Christmas
I hope yours is a bright one, but for me, it's blue",Blue Xmas (To Whom It May Concern),1995
Bill Takas,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1995
Bill Tannebring,"Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Bill Tapia,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [*],2003

Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue

Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
