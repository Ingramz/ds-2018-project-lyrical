Judy Garland,"Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let`s fight for love
Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!

After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone, there's no denying
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go my way by myself
This is the end of romance
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance
And I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I'm by myself alone, I'll go, I'll go by myself alone","Judy Garland Medley, No. 1: Hooray for Love/After You've Gone/By ...",1991
Judy Garland,"I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
You're sure to find
Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for

Now, gee I love to see you looking' swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love

Gee, I love to see you looking'  swell, baby.
Look like you just came up out of the wishing well, baby.
Dream awhile, scheme awhile and you're sure happiness and 
ALL those things you been looking' for baby.
Gee, I love to see you looking'  swell, baby 
Diamond rings, bracelets, gold watches 'n' everything, baby.
Until that lucky day, honey, you know good 'n' doggone well, honey, 
I can't give you a DADGUM thing but love.

Now, I can't give you anything but love, baby

Judy Garland,"The sound of applause is delicious
It's a thrill to have the world at your feet
The praise of the crowd, it's exciting
But I've learned that's not what makes a life complete

There's one thing you can do for the rest of your days
That's worth more than applause
The screaming crowd, the bouquets

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to

Fame if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found him, build your world around him

Make someone happy 
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too",Make Someone Happy,1991
Judy Garland,"Chillun', listen here to me
This is my philosophy
To see me through the day
To scare my cares away

All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
All God's Chillun got swing
Maybe haven't got money
Maybe haven't got shoes
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
For to push away the blues

All God's Chillun got trouble
Trouble don't mean a thing

Troubles bound to go 'way, say!

Judy Garland,"Buds won't bud, breeze won't breeze and dew won't dew,
One and one ain't even two
When the love you love won't love you.

Buds won't bud, chicks won't chick and micks won't mack,
Blue is white and white is black
When the love you love won't love back.

On account there's no accountin'
When you can't have the one you like,
All your troubles keep on mountin'
and the world is on a sit-down strike,
'Cause;

Buds won't bud, breeze won't breeze and dew won't dew,
One and one ain't even two
When the love you love won't love you.

Buds won't bud, breeze won't breeze and crows won't crow,
Eeny meeny's minus mo
When the love you love says, ""Hi ho"".

Buds won't bud, notes won't note and knots won't knot,
T's won't cross and I's won't dot
When the hope you hope goes to pot.

On account there's no accountin'
When you can't bring your dream about,
All your troubles keep on mountin'
And the world is just a big blackout,

Judy Garland,"Cry, baby, cry, cry, baby cry,
Just the way I did the day you broke my heart
Cry, baby, cry, you flew too high
Tables turned and now you've learned you're not so smart
You broke every promise
You couldn't be true
You gave me the go-by
For somebody new when I needed you
Cry, baby, cry. My eyes are dry.
I'm laughin' up my sleeve to see my cry baby cry.",Cry Baby Cry,1992
Judy Garland,"When the whole world seems wrong
just learn the words of a simple song,
of blue skies above,
be a troubadour and all is love.

When April showers stray
the silver lining will come they say,
and singin' in the rain's the thing
that those happy days again will bring.

So, everybody sing, everybody sing!
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.
Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!
Oh, say can't you hear the orchestra play?

Everybody sing, everybody start!
You can't go wrong with a song in your heart.
Everybody sing, get into the swing,
get happy, everybody sing.

Yeah, everybody sing, come on now, everybody sing!
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.
Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!
Oh, say can't you hear la-da-de-oo-de-lay-de-lay-o?

Everybody sing, everybody start.
You can't go wrong with a song in your heart.
Everybody sing, come on now get into that swing
Go Do Re Mi Fa So La Si Do
Do Re Mi Fa So La Si Do
Everybody sing, everybody sing!
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.

Sing before breakfast, help the birdies along.
Before you have your buttered toast, have a song.
Sing before breakfast, never quiet a thing.
Before you eat your shredded wheat, sing, sing, sing!

Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye
four and twenty blackbirds baked into a pie.
When the pie was opened and set before the king,
four and twenty blackbirds started into sing.

Sing a melody of love, a song will win your lady fair.
Sing a song that mentions love and you will yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

Sing a song of cheer again,
the skies above will be clear again,
those happy days are here again,
sing a song of cheer again.

If you worry, if you fret, if you're getting deep in debt,
let your frown turn summerset, get yourself a good quartet.

In the evening by the moonlight
you can hear those darkies singin'.

Sing good, sing bad,
Sing loud, sing soft,
Sing sweet, sing hot,
Sing!

Everybody sing, everybody sing!
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.
Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!

Judy Garland,"I am here to state
I'm here to relate
To explain 
And make it plain that: 
I`m just wild about Harry
And Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his
Kisses fill me with ecstasy
He's sweet just like sugar candy
And just like honey from a bee
Oh, I`m just wild about Harry 
And he's just wild about
He can't do without
He's just wild about me 
Oh I`m just wild about Mandy
And Mandy's wild about me
Oh, I`m just wild about Harry 
And Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his kisses 
Fill me with ecstasy
He's sweet just like sugar candy
And just like honey from a bee
Oh, I`m just wild about Harry 
And he's just wild about me",I'm Just Wild About Harry,1992
Judy Garland,"Fifteen thousand times a day,
I hear a voice within me say,
""Hide yourself behind a screen,
You shouldn't be heard, you shouldn't be seen,
You're just an awful in-between!"".

That's what I am, an in-between,
It's just like smallpox quarantine!
I can't do this, I can't go there,
I'm just a circle in a square,
I don't fit in anywhere!

I'm past the stage of doll and carriage,
I'm not the age to think of marriage;
I'm too old for toys
And I'm too young for boys,
I'm just an in-between!

I'm not a child, all children bore me,
I'm not grown-up, grown-ups ignore me,
And in every sense
I'm just on the fence,
I'm just an in-between!

I'll be glad when momma lets me go to dances
And have romances.
I'll be glad to have a party dress that boys will adore,
A dress that touches the floor.

I'm sick and tired of bedtime stories,
I'm so inspired by love and glories,
But I guess it's no use,
I still get Mother Goose!
I'm just an in-between!

I'm allowed to go to picture shows,
That is, if nurse is feeling able;
But we only go to Mickey Mouse,
I'm not allowed Clark Gable!
It's such an imposition
For a girl who's got ambition
To be an in-between!

My dad says I should bother more
About my lack of Grammar;
Huh!  The only thing that bothers me
Is my lack of glamour!
Why, if I use a lipstick and a powder puff,
Who knows, I might be Garbo, (in the rough)
Instead of in-between!

I'll be glad when uncle Jim
Can't call me ""Precious child!"",
That simply drives me wild!
I'll be glad to have a date
That doesn't grow on a tree,
A date that's not history.

I'll be so glad when I have grown some,
All by myself I get so lonesome,
And I hope and pray
For the day
When I'll be sweet sixteen,
Then I won't have to be an in-beteen!",In-Between,1992
Judy Garland,"Did y'ever wake up in the morning
And grumble as you tumble out of bed?
You stub your toe, ouch!
You hit your elbow, ooh!
You bump your head, oh!
You step on a tack and you let out a howl,
There's soap in your eyes and you can't find the towel!
You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!
Smile when you should cry,
For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!","It Never Rains, But What It Pours",1992
Judy Garland,"Oceans apart and with only the blue between
Since we're apart
I'm yearning
I tell my heart
We must wait for another dawn
When he may be returning

How I regret the night he sailed for another shore
Will he come into sight to leave my arms no more?
I'll kiss him again
He'll know right from the very start
That we were never meant to be oceans apart

Oceans apart and with only the blue between us
Since we're apart
I'm yearning
I'll kiss him again
He'll know right from the very start
That we were never meant to be oceans apart.



",Oceans Apart,1992
Judy Garland,"There's an old love refrain that has known the world over,
It's sweetness both princes and peasants may calim,
Like a bird on the wing or a bee in the clover,
No matter the language the song is the same.

Go to sleep, my baby, go to sleep,
While the stars above begin to peep,
They're lighting the windows of heaven, angels watch over you.
From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.

Sleep, my baby, sleep.
From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.

Sleep, my baby, sleep.",Sleep My Baby Sleep,1992
Judy Garland,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, give happy feet a chance
To dance

Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine

How my heart is singin'
While the band is swingin'

Judy Garland,"Swing Mister Charlie,
Oh swing Mister Charlie,
I don't care what tune,
Just make it a hot tune!
Play a note or two
Of a theme that's new;
And the notes you hit is harder than
Anything I've heard since time began!

Judy Garland,"Did you ever wonder why in thunder
Thunder comes in spring?
Once upon a time it seems
All the world was wrapped in dreams
Playful little fellas, so they tell us
Said Let's have our fling!
Spring is in the air, you know!
It's time to wake 'em up below!
So, when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry
They're playing ten-pins in the sky
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly
While rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky
The world will wear a new bonnet
Daffodils on it
Thanks to the skies above
Thunder and showers
Wake up the flowers
Where there are flowers
There must be love
So, laugh at raindrops, laugh at thunder
Clouds will soon roll by
They're playing ten-pins in the sky!",Ten Pins in the Sky,1992
Judy Garland,"Say there, if you are a vexed one,
A dreary, weary and perplexed one,
I've got trouble and he's got trouble,
And you're no better than the next one!
You will find your share of bliss
If you'll just remember this;

You can't have everything,
Be satisfied with the little you may get.
You can't have everything,
Don't envy neighbours or the fortunes that they get!

Live and laugh and listen,
Don't be greedy,
Help the needy,
And ya gotta get lucky, yes indeedy!

You just can't have everything.

For a song in your heart,
A penny in your pocket
And someone in your arms to love.

Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy

I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

We're gonna go through it together.
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep,
We'll always sleep cheaper together.

A duo
Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe.
A trio.
And any I. O. U., I owe you-oh's?
Who, me-oh? No, you-oh.
No, we-oh.

Including the cow,
Though business is lousy and slow.

Now all we need is someone with nerve.

The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Gone astray

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Judy Garland,"I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

On his knees there,
I hear him proposing!
He's not present,
Still it's pleasant,

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You [Extended Version],1995

Judy Garland,"And the gods beheld that the thunder warriors fought hard and brave in the
""battle of metal"". However, they wanted to challenge them once again. This test
Was called the ""battle of steel"". In order to aid them in their holy quest it
Was decided to bestow unto them four magic utensils.

So the gods called upon the old dwarf and the mighty wizard and told them what
They sought. The dwarf took the sword Nothung, once belonging to ""Siegfried
The dragon-slayer"", fused and smithed from it's steel four shakels of metal.
The wizard created the same number of amulets from the skin of a black demon.
He then took the silver shaded blood of a dead unicorn from which he drew four
Magic runes, each drenched with natural power.

The power and strength of a bear would be given to the bearer of the hammer
""giants death"", the speed of a hunting hawk to the bearer of the bow ""heart
Hunter"", the brutality of a lone wolf to the bearer of the axe skullcrusher,
And the deafening roar of a black lion to the bearer of the sword souleater.
Then the dwarf mounted the shakels of metal on the amulets whilst reciting
Ancient words of magic power. Thereafter the amulets were presented to the
Dragon lords, who brought them to midgard, home of the thunder warriors. They
Received this gift and a mighty power flushed through their veins. It was the
Power of magic-the magic of steel.

Suddenly thunder rocked the silence, lightning crushed the roof of the hall,
And the two mightiest gods of Valhalla -Thor and Odin- stood on the stage. The
God of thunder held his hammer on high. Odin wailed his spear into the
Audience. Any wimp present knew now that death was imminent. They disappeared
As quickly as they came.

In the blink of an eye the thunder warriors conquered the stage: Once again they
Would ride side by side with their legion of doom, under the sign of the
Wizard, to their next test- the ""battle of steel""... So they fought with the
Power of metal and again were victorious. They devoured the hearts and spilled
The blood of their enemies. Their weapons found the hearts of all decievers and
Liers, crushing their bodies to the ground. After the ""battle of steel"" was
Over the ground was covered by a sea of blood. From that day on the four
Thunder warriors knew that they were forever bound by metal.",Main Title [From Babes on Broadway],1995

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose

Waited through Spring and Fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See Winter time bringing
The happiest season of all

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although' it's been said many times, many ways

Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings

Judy Garland,"(Reporters) We are here to interview a lady known to you because of her ability as the glamorous, amorous lady they call...
(Butler) She's expecting you gentlemen, won't you please come in?
(Reporters) Now we don't mean Greta and we don't mean Bette or Loretta or the Song of Bernadetta. We mean the fabulous, fabulous lady they call...
(Butler) The other gentlemen are here. Please come in.
(Reporters) She's new; she's perfection; she's headlines; she's hot! 
And in advance the critics are all in accord - she's gonna win the next academy award. 
All her fans will be delighted, not to mention quite excited at her personal appearance presently. She's stupendious, tremendious, collosical, teriffical, she's got it! But, definitely! The glamorous, amorous lady they call...
(Judy) Flibbins, what is all this?
(Butler) The gentlemen of the press, my lady.
(Judy) Darlings! How utterly charming of you to have dropped in like this! 
How delightfully informal of you to have dropped in like this! 
I mean, how perfectly marvelous of you to have... 
Well, you have dropped in, haven't you? And I... 
Well, gentlemen, you have caught me pitifully unprepared. 
And now, you may rise. And now, you may rise... Up, up! Come, get up, get up, get up, get up! 
Let's get on with it. There, now, that's better, isn't it?
(Reporters) babbling, murmuring...
(Judy) Gentlemen of the press... members of the fourth estate... What can I do for you? Tell me, pray do.
(Reporters) Oh glamorous lady, oh amorous lady, oh hamorous lady, here's to you. 
And humbly we're here to... Quite mumbly we're here to... 
Hum-drumly we're here to interview you. We're here to pry into your private life. 
We're here to seek your every secret. We're here to scoop a scoop, obviously. 
What is your next vehicle to be?
(Judy) This is much too much. 
A sort of a bit of a go and touch. 
But, confidentially, gentelmen - and this is off the record of course...
(Reporters) Of course!
(Judy) But, about my next picture - I'm faced with a curious problem. 
Shall I always be dramatic, biographically emphatic? 
Should I devote my life to the legitimate art? 
Or should I do what I'd adore so, do my acting with my torso, and give all the natives a start? 
Must the roles I play be tragic, full of Oscar-winning magic, should I drink the cup of drama to its dregs? Or do you think it is permissible to be for once quite kissable and give them a peep of my leg?
I'd like to be a pinup girl, a cheesecake girl too. 
And what is Ginger Rogers that I am not? 
And what has Betty Grable got that I haven't got? 
Oh, the cinema must exhibit me in roles that so inhibit me, I feel, well I feel just like a soldier out of step! There! But, would the episode outlive me, would my public quite forgive me if I tried to show the world I'm really hep? But, now you darlings, you adorable dear, dear boys, I'm going to tell you all about my next picture... What is my next picture? No, no, don't tell me! Don't tell me! Shhhh!
(shuffling through pile of manuscripts on table) Madame Crematante!
Madame Crematante, gentlemen, will be a monumental biographical tribute to a monumental biographical woman who toiled, searched, starved, slaved, suffered, pioneered so that the world - you and I - could reap the benefits of her magnificent discovery, the safety pin!
The story starts in a dark, dank, dingy tenement in Amsterdam, Holland you know, in the flat of a poor, impoverished family, but of rather good antecedants. Gretchen Crematante was a very brave and noble woman who, against the wishes of her father, the Baron, you know, married this young inventor who didn't have a sou! Penniless!
And there they were in Amsterdam!
(Reporters) In Amsterdam?
(Judy) Yes, there they were in a dark and dingy tenement flat with no food and no heat and no money for to pay the rent. But did they care?
(Reporters) No, they don't care!
(Judy) Madame Crematante, she don't care! 'cause she seen the light just the other day since then she been tryin' for to find a way for to bring to the world a big invent, and so she did!
(Reporters) And so she did!
(Judy) Whoop dee doodee, Madame Crematante did! She toiled and strived and sweat and slaved, a stretchin' her mind and beginnin' to rave, but the price she paid was worth the pain, for on a cold and frosty morn, the safety pin was born!

Min won a contest for dancing good,
So she went away to Hollywood;
When Joe heard that it broke his heart!

In Hollywood Minnie traveled far,
They changed her name to Minnie La Mar,
And pretty soon she became a star,
The siren of the picture show!

But one day Minnie got awful mad,
a guy got fresh and she said, ""You cad!
My heart belongs to my Trinidad,
My Trinidad Calypso Joe"".

Aye aye aye, they call her Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, in Hollywood Minnie met a cad;
Aye aye aye, but there is only one native lad
Gets chinny with Minnie from Trinidad!

So Minnie gave up her dough and fame,
And she went back to from where she came;
And when she got there she heard with shame
That her Calypso Jo was dead!

When she heard that, she almost died,
She got a gun to try suicide!
But as she started to shoot, she cried,
""I think I'd rather live instead!"".

But now the natives are mighty glad,
'Cause Minnie came back to Trinidad!
Aye aye aye aye,
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye,
Aye aye!
Aye aye!",Minnie from Trinidad,1996

Touching your hand my heart beat much faster

And someday I'll know that moment divine

And hear the whistle echoing across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away

With the wheels singing ""westward ho""

Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash

A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose

If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck

He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanta grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh

Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good, that's all I need to know

Seems like happiness, is just a thing called Joe

It can be ecstasy

And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line

They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,

Ain't ever what a girl supposes;
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.

means an extra beer or sandwich),
Ev'rybody whispers: ""Ain't her life a whirl?""

A great big nation:
Wild old men who give you jewels and sables
Only live in Aesop's Fables.

Must pardon us if we do not believe you,

Causing ev'ryone
To think I'm what I ain't,

Judy Garland,"Last night, as I lay a-sleeping
A wonderful dream came to me
I saw Uncle Sammy weeping
For his children from over the sea

They had come to him, friendless and starving
When from tyrants' oppression they fled
But now they abuse and revile him
Till at last in just anger he said

If you don't like your Uncle Sammy
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came, whatever be its name
But don't be ungrateful to me!

If you don't like the stars in Old Glory
If you don't like the Red, White and Blue
Then don't act like the cur in the story
Don't bite the hand that's feeding you!

You recall the day you landed
How I welcomed you to my shore
When you came here empty handed
And allegiance forever you swore

I gathered you close to my bosom
Of food and of clothes you got both
So, when in trouble, I need you
You will have to remember your oath

If you don't like your Uncle Sammy
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came, whatever be its name
But don't be ungrateful to me!

For one certain face

I've been searching through the lands

It never was anywhere you

Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree

Or one red star hung low in the west
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest
Made me think for a moment, maybe, it's true

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""

Thought it was a little matronly

I knew he was just my style

And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three

I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way
And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door

Who tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,2010

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends

I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2010

Moonlight and stars can make such a fool of me.

I'm startled when you whisper, I'll run if you should sigh,
I must be so careful, or I'll kiss my heart goodbye.

Don't make me fall unless it could all come true.",Too Romantic,2010

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1965

I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight

I do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Long before I met you
I was sure I'd find you someday, somehow

Better better than a dream
What is real is more ideal than a dream
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream

Can this be a dream
Can I still be asleep on the couch there
Can this girl be really here
She seems to know by sheer intuition how I landed in this condition
Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept all year

As midnight fell on crucifixion day

And as evil tried to stop redemption's flow

This is rock bottom why yall, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earnin' a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoinin' the work force
But now the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects, make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I got next week
I'm strictly goin' from the bottom to the peak
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

I'm workin' real hard, and my pockets are swellin', and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams, I swear she's meant for me
We've been together over 2 years, goin' on 3
We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul","Crazy Love, Van Morrison",2005
Judy Koch,"Had an uncle named Matthew
He was his father's only boy
Born just south of Cobly, Kansas
He was his mother's pride and joy

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

And all the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had

Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun
 
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped them clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible
Faith as solid as a stone

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

So he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my Daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

So, I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him the song is sung
 Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue is just a Kansas summer sky","Matthew, John Denver",2005

And church bells ring

They bring their geese
Their finest fleece to please
The keenest eye
And hope and pray someone will say
There's something they might buy

And fish to gut

We thank the Lord
And kiss the ground

If there's no war

What a day in London
Everything's for sale
Cabbages and onions
Look up
Who's that, that girl up in the tree
It's not a tree
It's moving, see
Good grief, what can it be
Look there, I swear
She's flying through the air
She must be wild
She's just a child
I wish I had her hair

My heart is pounding like a drum
I can't believe my eyes
In London people seem to come in every shape and size
So many paths I wonder how they find their way
So many signs I wonder what they really say

London is everything I've heard and more
London is nothing like I've seen before
Music and feathered hats
And roofs that shine
With flags flying higher than a pine
She seems so sweet
She means us well
Size 20 feet
How can you tell
We'll rue this day, you wait and see
What is to be or not to be

How do they build their huts so tall
Can this all be one tribe
The things they sell
The things I smell
I never could describe
These cakes taste just like berries picked this very day
The sound a river makes still takes my breath away

London's as busy as a hive of bees
Grandmother Willow would just love these trees
Crowded and loud but so exciting, too
With colors I never even knew

What a day in London, nothing strange at all
'Cept a girl with someone maybe 10 feet tall
This day's become a day
No one is likely to forget
A day we'll all remember
As the day two worlds have met

Such beauty's rare
I'm quite impressed
(London is everything I've heard and more)
One mustn't stare
She's barely dressed
(London is nothing like I've seen before)
The strength of ten that's what I've heard
She's won the men just take my word
A brave young thing to venture here
(Music and feathered hats and roofs that shine)
It will be an adventure
(And flags flying higher)
Perhaps some brew to quench your thirst
(Than a pine)
Not with you, I saw her first

What a day in London
History was made
Take away the mystery
Then you're not afraid
We've seen a girl
(I've seen a world)
We never dreamed we'd see
(I never dreamed I'd see)
What an extra special day
Unique in truly every way
How wonderful this London day turned out to be",What a Day in London,2009

Judy Martin Hess,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages 
On that line stands an old rugged cross 
On that cross, a battle is raging 
To gain a man's soul or it's loss 

On one side, march the forces of evil
 All the demons, all the devils of hell 
On the other, the angels of glory 
And they meet on Golgotha's hill 

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict 
And the sun refuses to shine 
For there hangs God's son, in the balance 
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over 
It is finished, there'll be no more war 
It is finished, the end of the conflict 
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging 
Not all prisoners of war had come home 
These were battlefields of my own making

Had fought all the battles for me

Judy Roberts,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

And dream I'm dreamin'

I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1997
Judy Roberts,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this

Judy Roberts,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Judy Roberts,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

La prima volta l'ho incontrata
Non mi ricordo come ma 
Mi è entrata dentro e c'è restata 
Vivo per lei perchè mi fa 
Vibrare forte l'anima
Vivo per lei e non è un peso

Vivo per lei anch'io lo sai 
E tu non esserne geloso
Lei è di tutti quelli che 
Hanno un bisogno sempre acceso
Come uno stereo in camera
Di chi è da solo e adesso sa 
Che è anche per lui, per questo 
Io vivo per lei

È una musa che ci invita 
A sfiorarla con le dita
Attraverso un pianoforte 
La morte è lontana
Io vivo per lei 

Vivo per lei che spesso sa 
Essere dolce e sensuale 
A volte picchia in testa ma 
È un puguo che non fa mai male

Vivo per lei, lo so mi fa 
Girare di città in città
Soffrire un po', ma almeno io vivo

È un dolore quando parte
(Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels)
Con piacere estremo cresce
(Vivo per lei nel vortice)
Attraverso la mia voce 
Si espande e amore produce

Vivo per lei, nient'altro ho 
E quanti altri incontrerò 
Che come me hanno scritto in viso
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo per lei 
Sopra un palco o contro un muro 
(Vivo per lei al limite)
Anche in un domani duro 
(Vivo per lei al margine)
Ogni giorno 
Una conquista
La protagonista 
Sarà sempre lei

Vivo per lei perchè oramai 
Io non ho altra via d'uscita
Perchè la musica, lo sai 
Davvero non l'ho mai tradita 

Vivo per lei perchè mi dà 
Pause e note in libertà 
Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo
La vivo per lei

Lord, everywhere I look I see the sun shine
And I finally found that joy is mine
From doubt I'm cured; what blessings my reward
Since I've learned to trust in you, dear Lord
Your gifts I treasure; Love and perfect peace
In you I find forgiveness and sin's release

And I'll be forever grateful
For all you've been to me
You've given me wisdom; now I can see
I want to keep on growing and show others too
Lord, I'll be forever grateful to you

Once I had to have the very best Lord
Then was blessed and found I needed less
For you alone, dear Savior, have now shown
That you are not impressed with what I own
Thank you for giving me my brand new start
Lord, thank you for this feeling way down in  my heart

You took away the heartaches and the tears
You saw me through, my Savior, you always knew

Some just don't understand my goal

That in the dark I'll always know
That burdens only make me grow
I've yet to see

Have made me thankful, helped me see

It is no wonder
I truly feel blessed

I see the blood on the path where He was led
A crown of thorns, held tightly on His head

Write unique songs that must be sung

Supported my loved ones dreams
Found energy to work on mine

Found the door and paid my dime

DON'T SAY YOU LOVE  ME ... just to get your way
DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME.. I mean it when I say
I've been burned before so please be very sure
Don't leave me hurtin' when dawn breaks into day

DON'T SAY YOU LOVE  ME ... just to get your way
DON'T SAY YOU LOVE  ME ... and then leave some day	
If your heart is true and I learn to love you too
We'll be together for all eternity

So DON'T SAY YOU LOVE  ME ... just to get your way
DON'T SAY YOU LOVE  ME ... then lead me astray

Choose your words carefully
Leave unsaid the things you don't feel
I just want to heart the part that's real
So, believe me when I say ""DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME""
Unless you really love me
Love me, Love me ... Love me

Grandma's quilts are homemade treasures
Mine brings joy that I can't measure
'Specially when it keeps me warm at night
When your quilt's been stitched with love & pleasure
Each day's burdens seem so light

(CHORUS)
Grandma's quilts are built to last
Heirlooms of the past
Grandma's quilts are carefully sewn with love
You know it was you she was thinkin' of
As she planned and stitched
Oh, how I wish Grandma's quilts
Would last forever
		
Amy took her quilt to college
Found that more than books give knowledge
Love of family? that can't be beat
Lyin' 'neath her quilt she made a pledge
She would never know defeat

Sister Kari joined the Navy
Found the quilt that Grandma made
She always shared but still her heart was torn
When her hard-up friend just had a baby
She lent her quilt to keep that baby warm

(CHORUS)
                                                              
Mikey's quilt was for his birthday
He used to plead for Dad's in the worst way
Bad dreams would fade as Dad's quilt lay on his head
Grandma learned about this and hurriedly
Made a quilt for his own bed

Oh, how I wish Grandma's quilts would last forever

(CHORUS)
Life is a 3-ring circus
Diverts our eyes, jerks us around
Disguises, surprises
We laugh at the clown
That's in all of us
Life is 3-ring circus

Take the first ring I ever received, came on a first date
Bobbie took me to the fair and called me ""baby""
The ruby ring was the top prize at the shootin' gallery
He won it for me but ""he"" turned out to be a lady,

CHORUS

Another ring was the day the phone rang  and I was told off
And called most every name you can imagine
My innocence went unnoticed 'cause I couldn't get a word in
I later learned a former tenant was the guilty one

CHORUS 

Ring number three appeared on my mahogany table
I screamed, ""Why didn't you kids use a coaster""
Turns out my friend next door was the one to blame
Well, I ate humble pie 'cause she replaced my old toaster

He hops off his Harley and glides into the gym
Too shy to take notice all the girls are eying him
Without warming up, he lifts the heaviest weight
My heart skips a beat as I recall our first date

He often makes supper when I have to work late
Surprises me on my birthday with a home-made cake
He even runs errands for the old couple next door
He's a hunk for sure? but he's so much more

(CHORUS)
He's my macho man with a marshmallow heart
I knew he was special...right from the start
Looks that kill... buns of steel
He's not a dream.. No, he's for real
He's my macho man with a marshmallow heart
Yeah, a macho man with a marshmallow heart

He helps me with the shopping and he cuts the grass
Maintains my wheels.. Keeps that baby shinin' like glass
When I'm feelin? down he brings my favorite treats
Has a good word to say 'bout everyone he meets
	
He makes wooden toys for the poor kids in our town
He's there for his friends? never lets anyone down
And at his shop he gives good deals on car repairs
I'm thankful and so proud of all the love he shares

Thank God in heaven for my macho man
I'll love forever my macho man

Granny wore an apron every single day
Whether baking in the kitchen or helping Pa with hay
It wiped away my tears, when I fell and skinned a knee
It played peek-a-boo with baby to make him squeal with glee

(CHORUS)
It was a magic apron
I never will forget
The many, many uses
Granny had for it

It held apples from the orchard, rhubarb from the patch 
And cradled baby chick as soon as they were hatched
Carried eggs from the henhouse, popcorn from the crib
It had two big pockets and of course, it had a bib

And the high steps worsen her arthritic pain
No one offers to help and it's clear she heard

So remember  (spoken)

They married quickly and soon were pushing a pram
They'd been better off at the movies, it seemed to us
But we followed the rules and didn't make a fuss

Chasing a dream keeps boredom at bay
When I'm chasing a dream
My work seems like play
And there's a reason to face each new day
When I'm chasing a dream
When I'm chasing a dream

Early on in life I was always dreaming
Never a day went by that I wasn't scheming
One wish came true I'll not forget 
The day I became a majorette

Lying in bed I'd dream of the man I'd marry
Later I thought of the child I'd some day carry
Blessed with both, but needed more from life
Than being a mother and a wife

A little success has made the challenge lighter
And if I set my sights sky high
This dream could last until I die

You pump me up to win,  then I'm ready to begin

It's that pretty face I see

(""House of the Risin' Sun"" melody)

There is a church outside of town
It's called the risen son
The builder had great plans but died
Before the inside was done

Brother Ben carved God's commandments
In marble on ten walls
Was centered on a wooded lot
Far from shopping malls

Now this strategy using ten walls
Formed a definite decagon
The most unusual church around
Though Ben's gone, it lives on

[Instrumental]
The lovely stained glass skylight
Shows the Savior with a smile
His arms are reaching heavenward
Rising from the golden tile

Oh, I love to go inside that church
Even though it's not complete
I find such peace and solace there
As I pray, standing 'neath his feet

Perhaps this church called the risen son
In the Father's eyes is done
No pulpit or pews are needed there
To pray to Him, one on one

Oh, how I love to worship Him there
In the Church Called the Risen Son

I can't earn it, still it's close as a prayer
It goes far beyond the rainbow's end

No humble Hannah, life was a game
I had to be in charge and call each shot
I sped in high gear on a fast freight train
'Til GRACE appeared and changed the plot

Seemed so happy, you'd never see her frown
Everyone she met became a friend

Still she smiles and tries to please
Though treated like she has a contagious disease

She sometimes wonders if she's to blame
Forgives and protects the cause of the pain
She knows she's put on permanent hold		
Because of well-deserved success and can't be consoled

It's a mystery why she stays
In a town that shows no respect
Her kindness belies the anger that's slow to detect

Each time I want to go out on the town
You have a flimsy excuse
Well, baby, you're the one
Who's gonna lose

[Chorus:]
I'm hittin' the road
Gonna take a load off my heart 
I'm hittin' the road
We'll be better off apart 
I'm hittin' the road
Gonna make a brand new start 

I won't go on this way
No longer can I play the fool
And if you beg, I still won't stay
Not even just for a day
And I'll do just what I must
Baby, I have learned I can never trust
Your word to do what you say
But you're the one 
Who's gonna pay

Go on and be a couch potato tonight
I'm headin' out where the lights are bright

Judy Welden,"I'M PAIN SHY

You say you love me, Babe
Then you forget to call
You wonder why I'm holding back
Not giving you my all... it's because

 (Chorus)
I'm Pain Shy
Can't count the times
That I have suffered from a broken heart
I'm Pain Shy
That's the reason why
I've put our love on hold
That's why I might seem cold
And often say goodbye
I'm Pain Shy

Our love can never grow
I don't belong to you
It hurts to know I never will
That's why I've been so blue
Can't you see..

Chorus

I cannot share your life
Don't care to kiss and run
And freedom is a waitin' game
It might not ever come... don't you know...

(CHORUS)
If you're man enough to stick around
After all I put us through
Then I'll be woman enough    
To say I'm sorry and start anew
But if you're angry enough to say goodbye
Then I promise not to cry
And won't even try to deny
I played a leading part
In breaking both our hearts
So if you're man enough to stay
I'll be woman enough to play
By the rules of love

I didn't value what I had
That your star shone brighter than the rest
Then I put my love to the test
Now  I know that you're the best
And my thoughts just focus now on you
It seems the joke is now on me
'Cause I'm the one who's blue
Now knowing what you plan to do
Is killing me....sooo

When we first me you swept me off my feet
Said San Antonio livin' would be a treat	
Gave up my car and my old southern home
Thought life with you would beat my bein' alone

You're a long distance trucker always on the road
You dumped me on your mama, hey that's a load
I worked to feed your kids; you paid for your truck
No money for six months; you said ""tough luck""

(CHORUS)
Just leave me alone.. I don't need you
Too many years now I've been on my own
You've given me much grief & pain & it's not right
I'll be brief and don't want to start a fight
Leave me alone  (spoken)
Just leave me alone

Why do you always call from out of town
And bring up hurts that really cut me down
Then after each uncalled-for bitter fight
I toss and turn and worry half the night
	
You lied and beat me up when times were rough
You must believe that I've had enough
No need to write sad notes or beg on the phone
Why don't you just give up and leave me alone

CHORUS

I've done most every job 'cept walk the street
I'm on my own again and feel complete
You say you love me;  it'll be different this time

To start pleasin' you
So that good things are all
You'll ever want to say
But for now just find ONE GOOD THING
To make this hurtin' go away 		  
			  
You seem to think I'm the cause
Of all that's wrong in our lives
You won't admit your own flaws
And wear a tailor-made disguise
ONE GOOD THING that I recall
Is the man that you once were	
You were always there for me
I had it all;  Now it's clear
That I'm no longer first
And I fear my heart might burst	
The spiteful words you choose
Can't help but make you lose
'Cause you no longer can say

When our love is going right it's a rare surprise
My heart just wants to soar
You lift me to staggering heights of paradise
That I've never known before

Then when one thing goes wrong, oh baby
We let it keep hangin' around
Why can't we stay on top and start leaving
The grief scattered on the ground

[Chorus:]
Our love is like a roller coaster ride
We fly so high we almost reach the sky
But when we're starting to descend
It looks like it's all gonna end
We go round,  round, up and down 
And our hearts are caught up in the slide
Here we go climbing that hill once more
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  

Didn't you say the sweetest thing, oh darlin'
It was just the other night
You promised to buy me a ring so sparklin'
Right before we had that fight

Can't we just agree this time, oh baby
Why does it matter who has to pay
Let's make up and hasten our climb, then maybe
On top is where we'll stay

[Chorus]

Here we go climbing that hill once more
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  

We go round & round, up & down

How many shades of blue
Are you gonna dish me out today
How many shades of blue
Before I kiss you goodbye and say
This is the way it's gotta be
I'm leavin'...doncha see
You've played with my heart too long
Your many shades of blue
Have only made me strong

Powder blues' the color used
To describe my milder shade of blue
Ever since the day we met
Even then you made me fret
And sky blues' the color of your eyes
The very ones that told me tons of lies

(CHORUS)

Royal is the brightest blue
That one proved my loyalty to you
Like a puppet you could mold
I would melt 'til you turned cold
I found aqua blues' your fickle side
Walked in and out of my life just like the tide

(CHORUS)

The darkest shade was navy blue
That was when I waved goodbye to you
I was watchin' from the train
You were standin' in the rain
There was nothing more that you could do
You'd given me too many shades of blue

Too many shades of blue

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Show a nigga know yo, we the 1st teen millionaires in Harlem
Since rich and poor, you don't know, get to know
Ain't takin shit to left, jimmy jones rock and jock
Right back to the block and cock, it ain't hop and scotch
It's pop and scotch, in a bar they go shot for shot,
Matter of fact, outside the bar they go shot for shot

Me and my codie on a o-z, we go rock for rock,
Me and my codie on a role we go rock for rock,
You souped up, think I'm easy to touch,
Then you been watchin' a little bit of TV, too much,
Lots of rhymes, so you see my ass lots of times
On the corner still, like I ain't got a dime
Autographs not the kind to be signin' the crap,
Here's a CD, slash here's a dime of that crack

Shoot at yo feet, make you jump like double dutch,

Low on his funds, had to get the coke or the guns

Diplomat, crisp black, yo convertible fives
Rims on the wheel, to drive down shows in the south
Rap ain't that great neither, I got coke to give out
Stroke to give out, motherfuckin' smoke to give out
Hoes to give out, naw we ain't over this route
Back on the street, jimmy get the crack on the street

No keys, lock me in this corner for the longest but

The sequel to Able the way I slag Kane cause

Squeeze and blast them open as soon as the magnum open

The pain we done felt that to long
Cocaine we done dealt that to long
And my pops it don't help that you gone

Knee deep in my grave on these blocks

Mop filled, my block leaves cops killed, duck shots still
You not built, you had zirconia's, those was zirconia's
I kept it spot built, I can ensemble linen
Grinin' on rock, silk, I'm hitting bitches like switches
I'm a top Wilt, that's Chamberlain, mama became a friend
Said she had the lamest men, wanted to learn the game I win
I had to game her then, you rearrange your friends
Then you change that Benz, we need a Range with Rims
She bought a gravy Rover, it had a pastry odor
Yes she made the quota, cause I'm like Ray Liotta
Fiends in a caskets, leaning them bastards
But the meanest of fabrics, when I'm with Athena Onassis
Or Ms. Trina, the queen of the asses
Causes when it come to purple, I've seen it in masses

Whoo! Tino, you almost finished? (This ain't purple neither Tito)
This blunt almost out right here (I don't know what this is)
I love you man (I'm not smoking this)

And I'm a naissance child, gaming her stupid now
Plus, I'm stupid foul, pulled a coup to trial
I come through Canal, and let the luger style
In the DA mouth shit, here's a root canal
Right on center street, put 'em on front street
Next day the front page, who gonna front on me
Girls deranked and chumped, call 'em skank and cunt
Take a trip with the Dip bitch, to the bank to stunt
Serena Williams, downtown vacant and Trump
Who want to bang her rump, chump, yes I bring the pump
That's why I'm kinda hyped, because my money's good
Which means my mind is right, so I got time to write
How I grind at night, Next tab, china white
Army hat, army jacket, yesir my line is right
Diminish his army, we finished the Don P
Now let's get purple like Grimace and Barney
Holla

[Cam - talking]
I gotta come in now, I don't know what Tito's rolling up
I gotta roll it up my self (I don't know what's in them Dutch Masters)
If you don't crush your own weed up
And put it in the blunt yourself
Your own brother'll hand you some dust
That's what time it is
I gotta come in
Give me two minutes y'all, I'll be back with y'all in a minute
I gotta roll up",Purple Haze,

'Cause I ain't have no fresh clothes

My house had asbestos
I'm fixin' up a 60 pack, wit a kitty cat
Mice run around the damn sticky trap
Come on home wit me, where my mother found my crack platter

Threw it away so I snapped at her, back slapped her
She picked up a bat, like McGwuier for that matter
Hit me, I was back at her
Come home where I duck the DT's

Line around the corner, but I'm gettin' the free cheese
Come on home wit me, where I stand on my post
Play wit my toast, Been here wit mayonaise and toast
And pepper, many nights I done slept wit a heefer

Any beef came it left on a stretcher KILLA!
Come on home wit me, where they rapidly flossin'
Where I begged Kim to have the abortion
Money, brown bag, extortion

Caution, where there's tragedy often
Relax in a coffin
And the bitch know I'm serious
'Cause I'm never scared ma, unless you miss ya period

Had crack stones swiftly, Took it home wit me

The food is spoiled, but that pot wit the rock is boiling
Same pot mommy cook wit, left the oil in

Niggas don't listen to broads
They have you sittin' in court wit kids that ain't yours
Come home wit me, where every day the glocks go pop

Where the front door is broke, and them locks don't lock
Come home wit me, dog where the beef is seekin'
Kid's don't trick or treat, they get +tricked+ for +treating+
Come home wit me, where the pistols squeezing

Where niggas twist the cheekin, ripped to pieces are kids get even
Come home wit me, don't leave ya condoms behind
'Cause bitches leave them martians behind
Pray to God that I'm fine

Come on home wit me, come on zone wit me
Come on walk through this cold city
Where these kids need food
Niggas need God, and some bitches need rules

Come on home wit me, where niggas livin' off they last buck
Phonies off, rentings backed up
Come on home wit me, niggas strap up
Hit the streets gats up

Clap up, and get they money back up
Come on home wit me, every block got a crack in it
Every hallway gotta a nigga wit some crack in it
So don't get trapped in it

Come on home wit me, where my parents wit um...
Leave me alone
So early I was free to just rome
Wit 7 keys to the home

11 trees to the dome
13 I ran the streets wit the chrome
Come on home wit me, where the buses don't run
And my dog stay bustin his gun

Think that gettin' caught by justices is fun
Keep a blade up in they gums
This is Harlem, where the fuck is you from?
Uh, come on home wit me every few minutes was a knock on the door

Fiends come coppin' the raw
Clothes, kicks, socks on the floor
Mommy like ""Be quiet because I really think them cops at the door!""
There's some locks on the door

Come on home wit me, grandmothers is 30
One gram on that butter is 30
Sold grams wit my cousin birdy
School, cutting it early

Don't stutter motherfuckers you heard me
Come on home wit me, these are the facts
Steve Francis and Latifah got jacked
Mike Tyson punched Mitch Green in the face

Sauce snatched by the feds, weed was the case
And shit he still pleading his case
Come home wit me, hoes say ""let's jones wit you""
But I wouldn't take them home wit you

Come home wit me, get stoned wit me
Get zoned wit me, the crome you see

No key, locked me in this corner for the longest but
Common man they can't fuck with me, Juelz Santana

Linking up with Cam and linking up with the Roc now
Shit I told you, I won't fail you niggas man
Yo this is powerful music I bring to this table
The sequels are able the way I sling cane 'cause
Let the music talk to them
Yo, y'all know I'm fast in focus in case you haven't noticed
Squeeze and blast them open as soon as the magnum open
Yeah I told you man
Uh, Cam gone make me a star, I'm a make him a million

You get knocked down please grab your crutches keep stepping
Cause the game we done held back too long
The pain we done felt that too long
Cocaine we done dealt that too long
And my pops it don't help that you gone, myself to move on
Its scary and I'm gonna need help
Streets flaunting me, dogs and marijuana don't help

I try to be calm breathe easy, it don't seem easy
I'm on my Ps and Qs, Ys and Zs, .45 on the side of me
Plus, four guys on the side of me, with .45 on the side of them

We can play now, this is a war not a playground
We came here to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Wills for us any day now, cops with their wall to wall raids down
I'm ducking and weaving, running and leaving

Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plunger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this Nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as fuck, you're fucked if I leave ya chump

Went to school, but ain't stay in class, hated class
Only for period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games was bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at

Hop scotching on niggaz faces kept my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work and yeah, chopping the work up
Keep him on my clock, clocking my work up, niggaz know me

Taught him how to cook, livin' his work up
Told him it's not the pot, it's the worker, gotta mix shorty
Gotta do it like this shorty
Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist shorty
Fuck with me

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing

Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
The sequel of Able, fuck with your boy

You motherfuckers really don't know
You motherfuckers really wont know
I'm real fucka, I really wont fold
I kill fuckas and wheelie off roads

Bangie rapper, like I'm really off road
The pain I feel, I really wont show man
The game is real, I really don't know Cam
If I'ma make it or not

But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
Till the day I'm laid on the block, with shots in me

Stay weeded, stay cheffing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught
In my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me

So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen
Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it

This is the Matrix, I take it we live in
Shit, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'

Shoot shit, shit is poppin'
Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready whoa!

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing

Blowing that cheech and chong at them
Yelling, screaming the boy is platinum

They all imagine I crash
But I did straight through I'm bad
Like Michael was see what the cycle does
360 spin around, I'm the new kid in town

Yeah it's coming soldier, 
April the month it's over
Yeah your run is over
The album is done I told you
What a classic I made, I look up see Cam
See the game what a path that he made
A beautiful mind trapped in the shade
Cracking codes for the man
Who only stand in the back of my brain
At last I done came up in the proper way
True author like the great doctor J was

You can't respect the amount jewels in this new wide movement
If you don't respect the amount of dudes in this too live movement
Me and Killa, we like them,
Those two guys moving I-95 south dirty
With them two pies moving, moving
Trying to crease out the lightning
Trying to keep out the excitement
But it's hard in this bulls***, in this game
'Cause the secret indictments
And you coke experimenters
And you coke experiencers

Be easy on the phone dog,
'Cause you know the hearing us
You styling them b****es
Cause you know they serious
Just picturing, it's so easy to draw
Stop and freeze at them whores
Then we speed off in cars
Then we breezing the law
Blowing that weed from my jaw

G's up hoe's down
East Side to by dog 
(East Side)
All the time man
Thanks for even asking
Or we be seen in Aspen
In that pool house, that hot tub with that steam relaxing
And we be seen in action

Keep them fiends collapsing
And they thirsty and they nodding and the be ?
They see me my actions
I cruise by in a Beemer just laughing
I let that rock and roll

I coping poppy's load
It was like coping gold, 
I shut down poppy's load
I hit the strip dog
I see the cops get load
Now I'm living the life I got to stop and close
Big cars big stars like it's rock and roll

Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive in the city where the skinny niggas die?
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, why'all can't fuck with me, no way

Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, toys kissing muppets
Worst then that, they go home and kiss they husband

Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons buggin'

Plus, four guys on the side of me (for what)
With .45 on the side of them (yeah)
We can play now, this is a war not a playground
We came here to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Wills for us anyday now, cops with their wall to wall raids down
I'm ducking and weaving
Running and leaving
Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plugger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as fuck, you're fucked if I leave ya chump
Went to school, but ain't stay in class, hated class
Only first period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games is bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at (come on)
Hop scotching on niggas faces kept my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work, and yeah, chopping the work up
Kept him on a clock, clocking my work up, niggas know me
Taught him how to cook, livin' his work up

The pain I feel, I really won't show man
The game is real, I really don't know Cam
If I'ma make it or not, but my plan to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
'Til the day I'm layed on the block, with shots in me
Stay weeded, stay chiefin a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught in my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me
So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen
Base tripping off the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it

Diplomats, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Santana
Freaky, came in second half
Shit man, only thing we really wanna know right now is
What? Is what's really good? That's the question

Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence, but what?
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga

Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out asap

Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a icey white
I'm real icey right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is what's really good?

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?

I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'

They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?

Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?

One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them

Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

All my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her

Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?

I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty

I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh

You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
What's really good? Me motherfucker
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this
Santana, bandanna, release the eight a spit

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood

We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)

Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime

Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know, the usual
Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know

It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scam
If not, back to the block, ship some grams

See they tainted our image, it's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people, why, because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people

Yo, yo I speak pain, I spit power, talk courage, breathe flowers
Follow me through the debri of these towers, the rain, the sleet, the street showers
Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour, the soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together, in the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got to fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up you know?
You already know what I'm about homie
 I'm young I'm focused I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me
You know I ain't stopping yet
You know my album ain't done, it ain't dropping yet
I'm in the mist of a bidding war
And we need two milli more just to move in the door, shit

Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it
So line em up, shoot em down

Killa, yo, these girls told you I'm the man right? (right?)
Well listen to lover
When I beef, visions are gutter
Kids clapping, kidnappings, heard her missing a brother
I'm hitting your sister, you kissing your mother
The shit is disguster
Underground with people, lethal, trapped in the desert, surrounded by evil
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest, by Mitchell and S.
I got her opened, hoping she's not, I'd have her crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She'd get cracked up and hit, keep soaping your cycle mami
My girls lay up in suites, a half of cake of week, and masturbate like Tweet
Killa, I be popping the oozies, copping them Coogis, eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking the rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that would merk you like Jason Williams (uh Huh)
Don't play with villas', vacate the building
Or the eights will come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram
I'm still the man, word to Killa Cam (Killa Cam)

[Chorus]
Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it
So line em up, shoot em down
Do it know
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line em up, shoot  em down
Do it know
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it

Two of my cards and crooks slashed at two of my pawns and rooks
For all the charms they took
To my head of security, british the titan, clicking the fifth, and gripping it tight

Makin' crucial trips through the night (highways)
And Prince Juelz, I told you ever since Juelz
If them faggets even flinch Juelz (bluuuuatttt)
My dogs are gonna it 'em alive
Forty-fours, the pleading, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa wallys leading the movement, for realla we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in a tomb, just facing my time
Loyal on side, outside spoiler on rides, system bumping, bumping ?oh boy? in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit, he done came got his boy, he's ashamed at his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employed
Which is none other than Dip Set, for ya'll dumb motherfuckers (holla)

People say my theories is backwards
I tell them, sincerly, it's clearly, you hearing me backwrds
I tell 'em I'm great, but still I need practice
I tell them to wait, go and comeback quick, they don't understand me
It's not logic, I'm not logic, I got problems
I worship the late prophet, the great Muhammad Ali
For the words that he spoke, that stung like a bee
Soaked into me, you niggaz will see but
I'm still insane, I'm Rodman, dealing my brain
I'm grinding sharing my pain, fuck, where is the fame
Niggaz, they still rhyming, still in the game
They still dealing the cane, still cock shit in your brain, homie
I still smell the rotten people that lay
There in ground zero, forgotten, left in for days
Probably left there to stay, left in decay
Broken pieces of towers, left in their graves
I pray they be saved, until then, that's just a suggestion I made
Follow me homie, listen, I subjected my ways nigga
Weapons that spray, at your fucking face nigga
It's Santana the great, in the place niggaz, stay away nigga
Cause I'm headed straight to the top, niggaz

I seen it time, business and friendship
Friendships ended, business attended, clips get extended
Lawyers get called, accountants get faxed
That was my man, well I wish that he meant it
It's been a long time, hereing the mobsters
This ain't overnight, it's years in the process
Shed a tear in the process, now process is over
All my niggaz get prepared for the Oscars
Back to the block, sharing a lobster
Morris Malone, Sam Malone, preparing the vodka, holla
Hallejulah, no hum-do-allah, but respecting my Aki
He held me down, when it was getting real rocky
Hustling, isn't a hobby
I sit in the lobby, look at my ovie, have visions of Gotti
Visions of lotties, pictures of Blood, scenes of L
I want to see my son, piss in that potty
Jimmy, I'm going to make sure your wrist is real rocky
See my plans are for long term like Mr. Miyagi
Wax on, wax off, put our wax on, take that wack off
Over some nights, I had fights over the white
The roads to the lows, I knows what it's like
Now, career over like Mike: anyone
Tyson, Jordan, Jackson, it's over

How much did he sign for?
Oh, I bet you want to know that money
Yeah I bet you I won't show that money
I keep it stashed away, right next to the 4-4, money
Keep a lo-pro money, this is slo-mo money

Re-cook bag that, give it out, half that

Big bailor gets up, I get out, shit what, this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One that's new and strong, not old and hollow

I'm in love with you so, if you wasn't here I'd be in love with you soul
My angel, mommy I'd die faithful
Just knowing someone tried to violate you
I'll slide eighths through the side of their facial
Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
I'd take a slug, eat a bullet, swallow a gun

Damn, this type of love, could only come from a son
Hold up mommy, I'm twisted I'm drunk...listen

[Verse 1 - Juelz Santana]
Man where ever I go, I hold it down
I blow it down, you see me, believe me it's (Going down)
These hoes love me to death, they mumble under they breath
Lovely duets, boy, I'm (Going down)
I thought Mary J. was under my steps, nah I'm just playing
Love when ya sweat, keep singing (Going down)
I'm so fucking amazin, like Jordan to the league
When he first came in, it's (Going down)
I know you mad, my career's blowing up
Going up, holding up, and your's is (Going down)
Slowly but surely, so coked to the shorty's
Caught by the boys, the judge says your (Going down)
I had to call up my lawyer, gotta make court
And yawning, it's four in the morning, it's (Going down)
I need be out by the morning
Man the police need me to be out by the morning, or nothings (Going down)

[Chorus - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)
But, wouldn't believe it, couldn't believe it
Look I succeded, it's (Going down)
Baby keep walking wit ya hip, I keep walking wit a limp
Yeah you talking to a pimp it's (Going down)
Again, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now look, I'm back stronger than ever
Money's longer than ever, longer Baretta, it's (Going down)
Man we could get it on, it's whatever
The morns the better, I'm shorter, I'm better whenever it's (Going down)
Got a new chick, badder than ever
Ass fatter than ever, got it together and love (Going down)
No bud, no kiss, no hug
No rub, no bath, no tub, just love (Going down)
Yeah, that's my kind of baby
That's my kind of lady it's (Going down)
And the purse, you might find a eighty
Underneath her lip gloss, shorty keeps some lip gloss she's (Going down)
And that's why I love her, that's also why I don't trust her
Think she got her a sucker, nope (Going down)
Got another thing coming, not a baby but a
{???} believe me I done it (Going down)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, mama look at me now, mama look at me how
Ya beautiful child it's (Going down)
Mama look up and smile, you made a beautiful child
Still shooting the pound it's (Going down)
Gotta survive, maneuver through towns
Gotta drive, smooth through the town, or it's (Going down)
Cops on my ass, gotta shoot through the town
Shooting the pound, I ruined it now it's (Going down)
Only question is, will I get caught
Will I get cuffed, will I see court, will people see me (Going down)
No they won't, man I'ma survivor
Plus I gotta lady cop that's a rider, so nothing's (Going down)
You might catch me, crossing the border
Crossing the water, three ladies out and deported it's (Going down)

Man all I hear is Santana this, Santana that

That's how I feel..
Okay it's Santana, I'm back again
You know what man? What? What?
This is... Yea

You fuckas don't know a damn thing about me (Nope)
A piece, a part, a hamstring about me
The streets my heart you can't get it out me, it's
You fuckas know me, it was a sharp throb in my bones
I looked it was my own flesh, heart, and my bones, problems at home (Home)
So I left them there, got up out the atmosphere
Misery, loves company, I don't respect that there
Dip Set on the posta, boy for coming so close to
Being the black Lagrosta Nostra
Jim is my big buzzin, Zeek's my big cousin
Killa's my big nigga, also my big brother
We are the Dip family, get a grip family
Nothin alive can divide this family
So come on roll with the Set, come on roll with the best
The pain is felt niggaz know that you stressed (Oh)
The game itself don't notice your stress
You been left smokin, zoning on steps (No)
That's not the way to go, but that's the way you'll go
If you don't get up off you ass and find a way to go
Streets to rap, yea that's the way I went
Now its beats and rhymes, that's the way I pay the rent

Don't you believe me, won't you believe me?

On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway

They'll split ya whole body in half
Then dismiss you like

Like this here, reminds me of Gilligan's Island
And that reminds of Harlem, where my niggaz is whylin
The only borough that was built on an island, woah
You fucks probably ain't know, if they cut off the bridges
We'd be stuck, forced to live on the Island
But we gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Niggaz still want beef than holla
You think you bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
A young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons, cocaine lessons, just a plot of towers

I'm hurtin' working hard to reprovide the towers, like
Bring 'em back up, lift 'em back up

It's Santana the great again, tie him up, bandana his face again
I tried to tell 'em it's no escaping the basics
And no escaping the hatred and no escaping the matrix man
Only Neo is me, no Cleo can see my future, if she did I'd shoot her
They tried to say the mission was impossible
I came through, crew did it, got it poppin' too
Two bitches on my side both prostitutes
Gray smoke, mobster's suit, yeah they get it poppin' too
I get my ace holes chopped in two, dimes, quarters, rocks in two
The fiends cop it too
Yeah, look at 'em rockin' two, rockin' boat, Rock n' Jock

(Verse)
Now once again, a deep thought of Aaliyah
Crosses my mind, I rethought that I seen her, all in my mind
Memories of Big, all in the lime light, all of the time, all on his grind, right
I'm blacking out about 'Pac, blacking out on them cops
Middle finger, after blacking out from them shots
And I go visit Shyne, in my distant mind
I tell him stay up, cause in there it's a different grind
I see Eazy and Jam Master laughin'
Big L still rappin, like it never happened
I got a sick sense with me, God picked then sent me
To this earth place, to win in the first place
Visions of mommy, on an Island somewhere, yeah, I designed just for my mommy
My whole life is a blessing, that's why I'm so nice, so right
Approach mics with aggression
I got the type of obsession I would like to progress in
I write about me, and the life of my henchmen
I blow dice, roll twice to the deuce
That was nights, that was life on the stoop
This shit gotta change
Can't forget the hard white in the boot
White car stripped with the blue, narc parked right in the coup, damn
They riding around with a license to shoot
I'm riding around with no license and hoop, follow me now
Follow me down, this yellow brick road
187, hello, every ghettos zip code
I had to change my pace up, so I went left, while everybody went right
Had to switch the waste up, now I'm better off
Met Cam set it off, did the mix tape now look dip set is off
Put the bid in Def Jam bet it all
First writers refusal, Dame wouldn't let us off
So we matched it, we signed labels with Dashius
Cam goes platinum, the set is up next
A double album, we set for the best
Juelz is the test, which is me, fail or succeed
But still I'm here in the flesh, handing you breath
Mixed with a lot of thought, The Santana, Robb Report
I bring you more than just music I bring you me and all of my movement
I bring my whole life all in the booth shit
And I'm all in the booth with, the headphones on, the lights cut down
And all of this true shit",One Day I Smile,2003

Look at ya grandson, I done made it far
Damn nana, I know its killing ya bones that damn cancer
I wish I had an answer,but I don't I'm jus wishin for an answer
Watchin my mamma cry, she's watchin her mamma die
Every second I'm drying my mamma eyes, she so proud of her son
See right through my mamma eyes, she jus follow the drips
You can't dodge the rain but you can follow the drips
And every drop of rain that falls, has a drop a pain involved,you better believe

I see my niggaz for what they really are,what we really are
The dips we really are, let it rain

It has been long fights like this
Long days ,long nights nights like this
I'm wishing for rain. Nothing but the wind ever came
Little girls with they skirt up, the world's getting worser
Man I twirled through the world in a roaster
Twirling the smoke up, I be so high
Shit a week goes by, I still think the week just started
Man weed still sparking,still in tune with the street man
He still sparking, go ahead nigga leap feel frogish

You can't see through this love I'm dealing with
You can't be through or eat through this love I'm dealing with

Rats real I'm realing it all men like fishermen

Hey ma, its J.R. and L's
It ain't hard to tell
We da niggaz in we da niggaz in Maury and car alarm da fell wit that hard to sell
That ain't hard to sell
And a gun that'll hit you from far as hell
You quick to flash , we'll whip yo' ass
Couple shots hit your glass
Dip-shit ya whip will crash
I got the sickest past
Stay skippin' class, pitchin' Hash
All day, stood there
Flippin' halves
When I heard ,Squalie!
I dished and dashed
Ditched the hash
Park, neutral, first gear
Hit the gas, now we rich with cash
And when I hear Squalie!
I sit and laugh, dawg you kiss his ass
Cooked more caine, push off dames
While you dumb niggaz stand there
And look all lame
I done popped and took off chains
Now Ivory dump ice on me like my team
Won a football game!",Squalie,2003
Juelz Santana,"My baby don't mess around not mine
Because she loves me so 
And this I know fo sho 
But does she really want to 
But can't stand to see me 
Walk out the door 
Don't try to fight the feelin 
Cause the thought alone 
Is killin me right now 
Thank god for mom and dad 
For stickin together 
Cause we don't know how 

[Chorus:]
You think you got it 
Ohhh you think you got it 
But got it just don't get it 
Cause there's nothing at allll 
Ah allllll ah allllll

Ohhh we get together 
But separate's always better 
When's there's feelings involed 
Ah alllll ah allllll 
Ah alllll ah allllll ya juelz in the house

",Wherever I Go,2003
Juelz Santana,"My name mean a lot to me, pain mean a lot to me
Fame means nothing, but the game means a lot to me
I slang caine on these blocks for weeks
Ever since Rocky III, and the death of Apollo Creed
I was a tiny little poppy seed
As grimey as I could be, as sheiesty as I could be
Niggaz who live nicely, who don't understand the life of me
Other niggaz don't like me, and wanna take my life from me
They don't understand that I love it, and I like the beef
The raw, the guns, the violence, it's all right with me
I be laying in the cut where the sniper be
Righteously, waiting for you to get out the driver's seat
I don't think like usual people
Who think like usual people, who don't think right
I think like Muslims, in movements of people, who move they people
And move on your people, power is stronger than voo doo and evil
I'm immune, I drunk the juice, took a root from the needle
Still trying to figure out, why I do, the crimes I do
With the minds IQ, of an Einstein too
Tell 'em, Cha-cha, and bon, bon goo, they think I'm crazy, well I do too
Leave me alone please, I'm in my two-three zone please
Nothing can stop me, you fuckers can't stop me

[""Why"" continues to play]

[Verse 2]
It's like my life keeps turning around
Every second I need a lighter, I keep burning it down
I smoke so much, I could nurture a pound
My thoughts are always foggy, they blurring right now listen
I see the game for what it's worth, pain, fame and work
Girls walk with they brain in their skirt
So while you're fucker, they thinking
Of ways to get even, or a way out the hood, they make up a reason
For the judge, for you take him and see him
Until you face a subpena, that'll change your demeanor
So be careful, where you skating through this game
Remember it's other niggaz playing, skating in your lane
Don't get clipped, or stripped skating in the rain
Cause niggaz will keep rolling, and skating on your brain
That's just the rules and regulations of the game
When you playing you, you playing, and you paying like you weigh in, so..
If not, those wolves aiming where you layin'
And waiting on you patient with that thing up in the basement
That's why I walk with that thing out, when I'm pasting
Cause I know these niggaz hate it, that their little sisters love it
And their girls really want it, plus I'm frontin
Twenty three big truckin, new Z, new bucket
Fuck it
