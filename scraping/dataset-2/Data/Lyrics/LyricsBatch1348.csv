Brian Doerksen,"Faithful one, so unchanging
Ageless one, you?re my rock of peace
Lord of all I depend on you
I call out to you, again and again
I call out to you, again and again

You are my rock in times of trouble
You lift me up when I fall down
All through the storm
Your love is, the anchor
My hope is in You alone",Faithful One,1997

Brian Doerksen,"I am convinced
No force on earth
Can separate us
From the love of God
Angels or demons
This life or death
Won't separate us
From the love of God

So high so wide so measureless
Filling eternity
So strong so deep so intimate
Encircling mystery
That nothing can take Your love from me

Violence or danger
Hunger or shame
Won't separate us
From the love of God

No force on earth
Can separate us

Brian Doerksen,"A mighty fortress is our God
A stronghold never failing
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing
For still our ancient foe
Conspires to work us woe
His craft and power are great
And armed with bitter hate
On earth is not his equal

If we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing
Unless God's man is on our side
The man of God's own choosing
You ask who that may be
Christ Jesus, it is He
The Lord of Hosts, His name
From age to age the same
And He must win the battle

And though this world, with devils filled

Should threaten to undo us
We will not fear, for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us
The Prince of Darkness grim
We tremble not for him
His rage we can endure
For lo, his doom is sure
God's word shall overthrow him

That word above all earthly powers
Is evermore abiding
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Jesus with us siding
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also
The body they may kill
God's truth is with us still
His kingdom is forever",A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,2004

Brian Dullaghan,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1997
Brian Dullaghan,"There's a tear in your eye, 
And I'm wondering why, 
For it never should be there at all.
With such power in your smile, 
Sure a stone you'd beguile, 
So there's never a teardrop should fall.
When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song, 
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You should laugh all the while
And all other times smile, 
And now, smile a smile for me.

When Irish eyes are smiling, 
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring.
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing.
When Irish hearts are happy, 
All the world seems bright and gay.
And when Irish eyes are smiling, 
Sure, they steal your heart away.

For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart, 
And it makes even sunshine more bright.
Like the linnet's sweet song, 
Crooning all the day long, 
Comes your laughter and light.
For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret; 
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours, 
Let us smile each chance we get.

When Irish eyes are smiling, 
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring.
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing.
When Irish hearts are happy, 
All the world seems bright and gay.
And when Irish eyes are smiling, 
Sure, they steal your heart away.",When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,1997
Brian Dullaghan,"I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea;
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunadee.
I miss the River Shannon and the folks at Skipparee;
The moor lands and the meadows,
With their forty shades of green.

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town,
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown.
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen,
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar,
And there's forty shades of green.

I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churning surf;
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf.
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean;
I'd walk from Cork to Lairn to see their forty shades of green.

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town,
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown.
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen,
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar,
And there's forty shades of green.",Forty Shades of Green,2013
Brian Dunning,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night,1996

Brian Eno,"Blank frank is the messenger of your doom and your destruction
Yes, he is the one who will set you up as nothing
And he is one who will look at you sideways
His particular skill is leaving bombs in people's driveways.

Blank frank has a memory that's as cold as an iceberg
The only time he speaks is in incomprehensible proverbs
Blank frank is the siren, he's the air-raid, he's the crater

Gotta be crazy

Some of them will turn up when you least expect them to
And when they do, remember me, remember me.

Lucy you're my girl, Lucy you're a star
Lucy please be still and put your madness in a jar
But do beware, it will follow you, it will follow you.

Brian Eno,"Cindy tells me, the rich girls are weeping
Cindy tells me, they've given up sleeping alone
And now they're so confused by their new freedoms
And she tells me they're selling up their maisonettes
Left the Hot points to rust in the kitchenettes
And they're saving their labour for insane reading.
Some of them lose - and some of them lose
But that's what they want - and that's what they choose
It's a burden - such a burden
Oh what a burden to be so relied on.
Cindy tell me, what will they do with their lives
Living quietly like labourer's wives
Perhaps they'll re-acquire those things they've all disposed of.",Cindy Tells Me,1974

Oh you headless chicken
Can those poor teeth take so much kicking?
You're always so charming
As you peck your way up there.

And these finks don't dress too well

To be a zombie all the time
Requires such dedication.

So please read them closely
When you've learnt them be sure that you eat them up
They're specially flavored with burgundy, Tizer and rye
Twelve sheets of foolscap, don't ask me why.
We hit the jungle just as it starts to monsoon
Our maps showed no rainfall
All the boys were depressed by this circumstance
Trust in the weather to bless agricultural man
Who gives birth to more farmhands, don't ask me why.
Fifteen was chosen because he was dumb
Seven because he was blind
I got the job because I was so mean

Drifting about through the cauliflower trees
With a cauliflower ear for the birds
The Squadron assembled what senses they had
And this is the sound that they heard
Back at headquarters khaki decisions are made
File under 'Futile', that should give you its main point of reference
It's all so confusing, what with pythons and then deadly flies
But to them it's a picnic, don't ask me why.
Thirteen was chosen because of his luck
Eleven because of his feet
One got signed up for exceptional pluck
Another because he was mute
Roaming about through the gelatin swamps
With a gelatin eye on the stripes

There were milkmen every morning
But/Fuck these endless shiny trees
Never used to be that way.",Back in Judy's Jungle,1974
Brian Eno,"When I got back home I found a message on the door
Sweet Regina's gone to China cross legged on the floor
Of a burning jet that's smoothly flying
Burning airlines give you so much more

How does she intend to live when she's in far Cathay
I somehow can't imagine her just planting rice all day
Maybe she will do a bit of spying
With micro cameras hidden in her hair

I guess regina's on a plane a Newsweek on her knees
While miles below the curlews call from strangely stunted trees
The painted sage sits just as though he's flying
Regina's jet disturbs his wispy beard

When you reach Kyoto send a postcard if you can
And please convey my fond regards to Chihhao's girl Yu-lan
I heard a rumor they were getting married
But someone left the papers in Japan

Left them in Japan",Burning Airlines Give You So Much More,1974
Brian Eno,"In the haze of the morning, china sits on eternity
And the opium farmers sell dreams to obscure fraternities
On the horizon the curtains are closing

Down in the orchard the aunties and uncles play their games
(like it seems they always have done)
In the blue distance the vertical offices bear their names
(like it seems they always have done)
Clocks ticking slowly, dividing the day up

These poor girls are such fun they know what God gave them fingers for
(to make percussion over solos)

China my china, I've wandered around and you're still here
(which I guess you should be proud of)
Your walls have enclosed you, have kept you at home for thousands of years
(but there's something I should tell you)
All the young boys are dressing like sailors

Brian Eno,"Monica sighed
Rolled on her side
She was so impressed that she just surrendered
She was moved by his wheels
She was just up from wales
He was fueled by her coals and he was coming to catch her

Nail down the blinds
And in the succulent dark there's a sense of ending
Joking aside

Has fallen prey to the great pretender.
Let me just point out discreetly
Though you never learn
All those tawdry late night weepies
I could make you weep more cheaply
As the empty moon enamels
Monica with spoons and candles
Bangs around without the light on
Furniture to get it right on
Settled in a homely fish pool
Hung with little eels
Often thinks that travel widens
'stay at home, the trout obliges'
Monica sighed
Rolled on to her side
She was so impressed that she just surrendered.",The Great Pretender,1974
Brian Eno,"I can think of nowhere I would rather be 
Reading morning papers, drinking morning tea: 
She clutches the tray 
And then we talk just like a kitchen sink play 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 
Living so close to danger, 
Even your friends are strangers 
Don't count upon their company.

This is for the fingers, 
This is for the nails: 
Hidden in the kitchen, 
Right behind the scales. 
What do I care? 
I'm wasting fingers like I had them to spare, 
Plugging holes in the Zuider Zee. 
Punishing Paul for Peter, 
Don't ever trust those meters 
What you believe is what you see.

In my town, there is a raincoat under a tree. 
In the sky, there is a cloud containing the sea. 
In the sea, there is a whale without any eyes. 
In the whale, there is a man without his raincoat.

In another country, with another name 
Maybe things are different, maybe they're the same.

Back on the trail, 
The seven soldiers read the papers and mail 
But the news, it does't change. 
Swinging about through creepers, 
Parachutes caught on steeples 
Heroes are born, but heroes die. 
Just a few days, a little practice and some holiday pay, 
We're all sure you'll make the grade.
Mother of God, if you care, 
We're on a train to nowhere 
Please put a cross upon our eyes. 
Take me - I'm nearly ready, you can take me 
To the raincoat in the sky. 
Take me - my little pastry mother take me

Your good deed for the day
Put a straw under baby
Keep the splinters away.

As the dark places grow

On the landing below.

Where no one dare go

Turned into a crow.

It is an empty modern hallway and the dreamdoll saleslady sits at the reception desk. Without prompting she goes into her rap: ""This is the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging, those you are about to see are all in for servicing, except for a small quantity of our new product, in the second gallery. It is all the stock required to cover the existing arrangements of the enterprise. Different batches are distributed to area operators, and there are plenty of opportunities for the large investor. They stretch from the costly care-conditioned to the most reasonable mal-nutritioned. We find here that everyone's looks become them. Except for the low market mal-nutritioned, each is provided with a guarantee for a successful birth and trouble free infancy. There is however only a small amount of variable choice potential - not too far from the mean differential. You see, the roof has predetermined the limits of ac
tion of any group of packages, but individuals may move off the path if their diversions are counter-balanced by others.""

Running out through the factory floor, he catches sight of his brother John with a number 9 stamped on his forehead.

Brian Eno,"Woke up this morning desperation a.m.
What I've been saying won't say them again
My head's not empty, it's full with my brain
The thoughts I'm thinking
Like piss down a drain

And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch

Ought to control what I do to my mind
Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing are not good
For my health

Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about,
'Cause most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
Or how happy they are to be in love,
You occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time -
It's because these groups think there's something very special about it
Either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has,
You know to burst into song you have to be inspired
And nothing inspires quite like love.

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
By singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
Or so they would have you believe anyway
But these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
That love is deep in everyone's personality.
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love,
We just don't think that what goes on between two people
Should be shrouded with mystery.

Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch",Sky Saw,1986
Brian Eno,"In the beginning you really loved me
But I was blind and I could not see
But when you left me, oh, how I cried
You don't miss your water, till your well runs dry

I was a playboy, I could not be true
I couldn't believe that I really loved you
But when you left me, oh, how I cried
You don't miss your water, till your well runs dry

Brian Eno,"See the sun rise over her skin
Don't change it
See the sun rise over her skin
Dawn changes everything
Everything
And the delta sun
Burns bright and violet

Mississippi and the cotton wool heat
Sixty six a highway speaks
Of deserts dry
Of cool green valleys
Gold and silver veins
Of the shining cities

In this heartland
In this heartland soil
In this heartland
Heaven knows this is a heartland
Heartland, heartland

See the sun rise over her skin
She feels like water in my hand
Freeway like a river cuts through this land
Into the side of love
Like a burning spear
And the poison rain
Brings a flood of fear
Through the ghost ranch hills
Death valley waters
In the towers of steel
Belief goes on and on

In this heartland
In this heartland soil
In this heartland
Heaven knows this is a heartland

It's been a lazy afternoon.
We walk to the house, the air is clear,
The water's still moving in the pool.
You say one word.
The same one sound.
Thing it makes
Again. the world go 'round.

We fight. you can't win -
We're in the same place

Fade away. I don't mind.

We were miles and miles away.

Remember this oil by augustus john?
These are the ones I found in rome.
There are few things I keep for long.
When does your plane leave for cologne?

I recall one word -
The train - I saw -
People danced that's all it took
Again. to turn them around.
One world strange world,
We're in. no sound.
We'll find the same things
The same thing. are everywhere around.
Never mind... you'll see,
With time, with time
We'll dance again. we'll dance again.
If it all fades away... let it all fade dancing away.

All the sounds I heard one word,
On a summer night, I found,
And the quiet words that's all it took
We exchanged. I felt to turn him around.
She was pulling back she watched.
To emphasize - he sighs.
I was falling he waits for
Into mona lisa's eyes. a touch of her eyes.
And she turned, and then
And she turned, she turns away.
She was far away. she won't let him
She was miles away. touch her any more today.

She was miles away.
She was so many miles away.

Brian Eno,"I was dreaming
It's a hundred and ninety degrees
We were crawling around on our knees
Till the sun came up at quarter to three

But the time we had
Dirty clothes and dirt on our walls
Swinging on the bathroom doors
Thinking we were having a ball

Until somebody said they'd
Been there, done that
Been there, don't wanna go back
Been there, done that

Been there, don't wanna go back
Yesterday I called you on the telephone
To tell you I was feeling alone
Where you been for the last few days?

I want you back

He wrote to me from Cordoba.
After the theatre, we went to his house.
He's a very generous Cordoban.
We waited at the door, but he didn't come.
According to his father, he's very ill.
There was a long line of cars
in front of me.
I came as soon as I could.
I left without paying, a suitcase under my arm.
I won't see you until Sunday.
I'll come as soon as I can.
I'll meet you alone in the shoeshop near the bakery.
By the two-storey house/very pretty/like a villa.

Brian Eno,"Crime and punishment in Tuscon
Back to normal in the sun
Playing blackjack in the drive-in
Shooting snake-eyes in the mud
And when the moonlight came out, we were gone, long gone.
They found a body on the race-track;
No identifying signs
In his pocket was a notebook
With a number inside
And Guadalajara's just a few miles down the line.

And those who showed her a bad time
They didn't care for her body
They took advantage of her mind.
So they took her ideas and they left her behind.",Crime in the Desert,1990
Brian Eno,"So they rode the sea,
It went on and on
They were years away
Though it seemed so long
But the captain never told them what he knew
As the poor ship laboured on through the endless blue.
Oh the storm was strong
And the ship was so frail
But they stumbled on
Raising broken sails,
And they held the heavy sky on their open hands
And they dreamed of when their poor feet would touch the land.
Baby, we're going round in circles!
Where is this place we're going to?
Does anybody know we're out here on the waves?
And are any of our signals coming through?
We're going 'round in circles.
We have no single point of view.
And like the clouds that turn to every passing wind,
We turn to any signal that comes through.
At the edge of the sea
Were the signs of the dove -
But the wrong way out
And the wrong way up.
We pushed the empty frame of reason out the cabin door,
No we won't be needing reason anymore.

Brian Eno,"I'm a man of many colours:
Only yesterday I was blue.
Ten days from now, I'll be different
And so will you.
Written there in capital letters
So as not to be misunderstood
Making sure I'm clear,
Telling bad from good.
Two weeks ago in Tokyo,
A man from Islamabad:
Selling shells back to the rebels,
Shells they never had.
All is clear: I can see for miles and miles.
I can hear your footsteps in my heart.
Somebody make me an offer
I've got to get away from here, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Driving hard through the snow-drift
Like a moth to a naked light
To keep an appointment in Zurich
With a man who hears footsteps in the night.
Tired of what he's been doing,
What it's done to his life...
Getting most if what he needed
Has left him with less than he had.

Habantilderos on the move,
It's music to their ears in the backroom.
If there's money to be made,
And it's a hundred in the shade and in the backroom,
She's sentimental like the last
Of the foreigners running past her to the backroom.
And if things aren't sweet in Mecca
She'll be begging for forgiveness in the vacuum.
They're taking pains with California,
And they're guaranteeing boredom for the monsoon.
And apart from what was offered
There were mothers buying orphans at the auction
Youre much better off in Twos
If you're coming to see the carnage in the backroom.
Doubled over on the table
I was concentrating harder in the backroom.
Weaving in and out of consciousness
Hiding out behind the entrance to the backroom.
It took longer than expected:
They had difficulty swallowing capsules.
We had a keener nose for trouble
Than the sniffer-dogs at Heathrow -
You'd be trousers down in no time in the backroom.
Almost nothing in the papers...
Told me it happened when they emptied out the backroom.",In the Backroom,1990

I need no fact or validation
I span relentless variation

And I have waited for this time.
I am the termite of temptation
I multiply and find my population
I am the wheel I am the turning
And I will lay my love around you.
I am the sea of permutation
I live beyond interpretation
I scramble all the names and the combinations
I penetrate the walls of explanation

Brian Eno,"Up on a hill, as the day dissolves
With my pencil turning moments into line
High above in the violet sky
A silent silver plane - it draws a golden chain
One by one, all the stars appear
As the great winds of the planet spiral in
Spinning away, like the night sky at Arles
In the million insect storm, the constellations form
On a hill, under a raven sky
I have no idea exactly what I've drawn
Some kind of change, some kind of spinning away
With every single line moving further out in time
And now as the pale moon rides (in the stars)
Her form in my pale blue lines (in the stars)
And there, as the world rolls round (in the stars)
I draw, but the lines move round (in the stars)
There, as the great wheels blaze (in the stars)
I draw, but my drawing fades (in the stars)
And now, as the old sun dies (in the stars)
I draw, and the four winds sigh (in the stars)",Spinning Away,1990
Brian Eno,"When all the worlds are lost in snow
I have to move this meaning through;
Disperse the force so far engendered
All near the steam and summer view
And then... remain.

Where steeples crash in fire and thunder,
Where sheets of steel obscure the land,
Where word and sense are torn asunder:
Here was the place I chose to stand.
Just when I think I'm going under,
I... remain.

Well all the waves of spin are foaming,
And fake muezzin steam and brew,
Formed in the fire of all their longings(? )
This is the way I took it through,
Just when I think I'm going under.
This is the way I thought it through;
This is the way I took it under...

You would never believe that
She'd tasted royalty and fame 
If you saw her now. 
But her sense of taste is such that she'll distinguish with her tongue 
The subtleties a spectrograph would miss,
And announce her decision, 
While demanding her reward: 
The jellyfish kiss.

Now we checked out this duck quack 
Who laid a big egg, oh so black 
It shone just like gold. 
And the kids from the city, 
Finding it pretty, took it home, 
And there it was sold. 
It was changing hands for weeks till someone left it by their fire
And it melted to a puddle on the floor: 
For it was only a candle, a Roman scandal oh oh oh,
Now it's a pool.

I want to be the wandering sailor
We're silhouettes by the light of the moon

You're the same as everyone
What makes me unique?
My dark life
There was a kink in the world
Sent that statue tumbling
An invitation east
So we can watch it all crumbling

She came off like light and so softly she spoke
""You don't know, no you don't know about my dark life""
And you think you're a guest, you're a tourist at best
Peering into the corners of my dark life
Now that you tear your dreams from consumptive ballerinas
She'll stand on tiptoes for you in a grey and tattered tutu
She stays where she is because of voyeurs like these
With an accusative look that says ""my dark life""

Robber men await you then in each beguiling alley
To shake you and to pierce you and remind you of
My dark life

Enter the pious elite, in their preening finery
And bang the tambourine
They're dining on rice paper scenery
See how the villain attracts envious glances from everyone
She's waitressing by day
It doesn't bring in much money now

And his strong concealed arms set off bells and alarms
In the strangest locations of my dark life
But the fantasy slipped as he tipped her in cigarettes
She tries to smile very graciously when she wants to kill him
Now the victory is sweet, you get down on your knees
It's the perfect position for kissing western leather

So they came from ugly Texas and from nameless Tennessee
From peculiar Missouri and from places closer to me
All the cream of heartless England, cheered ""the carnival is over""
The are remnants of red army bandsmen played ""America The Beautiful""",My Dark Life,1996

But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones,
Ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard,
I ain't got time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines,
I know that that ain't allowed

We dress like students, we dress like housewives,
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,
I don't know what I look like!

You make me shiver, I feel so tender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get you some sleep

There's a party up there all the time
And they'll party till they drop

Everybody else can split
I'll be here all the time
No, I can never quit

Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Don't look so disappointed
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?

There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops

To wake with open eyes
As the snow across the tundra
And the rain across the skies

So much again and weightless
In the motherworld of space
We fail to form to come to
And the razor mountains fade
And the day is cursed in shame

In these the world we open
So much to lose to save
To light the highest beacons
And the rose of love will bleed
And the rose of love will bleed

The Earth and the sky
What too long
And what too high
Fallen free and holding on
Nothing there at all

Dropped and lifted
Gotta breathe
Bottom drifting
On the way
Holding just a few poor words
And nothing at all

Reaching out
To still the sand
No light connects
The breaking moments
Drifting to another shore
There's nothing here
That I could change at all
Nothing at all

Forced to be
A broken line
Let to hold
What we could find
Then to learn
And go again
Nothing sorted out

High above
A single bird
It drifts about
The dead volcano
Who's to lose
And who's to find
There's nothing here
That I could choose at all
Choose at all..

We've had enough
And we can compromise
Take those glasses off your face
I want to see your eyes
I read a book
A funny book
A book about your life
You call yourself a free man
But all you did was time
When time will judge
And time will heal
And time will bury us all
And now you're in your coffin
With a satellite dish installed

Only this other fool surrounds you
You have no one to love only this other fool surrounds you
Only this other fool surrounds you
Only this other fool surrounds you

From the breast we all partake

It's just an old photograph, there's nothing to hide
When the world was just beginning

I memorized her face so it's not forgotten
I hear the wind whistle in, come back anytime
And we'll mix our lives together
Heaven knows, what keeps mankind alive
Every hand goes searching for its partner in crime
Under chairs and behind tables
Connecting to places we have known

I'm looking for a home, where the wheels are turning
Home, why I keep returning
Home, where my world Is breaking in two
Home, with the neighbors fighting
Home, always so exciting
Home, were my parents telling the truth?
Home, such a body feeling
Home, no one ever speaking
Home, with our bodies touching
Home, and the cameras watching
Home, will infect whatever you do
Where home, comes to life from out of the blue

Tiny little box from a beach at sunset
I took a drink from a jar and into my head
Familiar smells and flavors
Vehicles are stuck on the plains of heaven
I've seen their wheels spinning round
And everywhere I can hear those people saying
That the eye is the measure of the man
You can fly from the stuff that spills around you
We're home and the band keeps marching on
Connecting to every living sole

Brian Eno,"There`s a Malayan stripper of sex unknown
Some Siamese twins from a broken home
Maria`s party, what a show going down
Maria loves her life, but she`ll show you how
There`s a strong man tearing himself into pieces
A magician who will spin you on the end of his spinderly fingers
There`s a show going on
Maria loves her life, she`ll show you how, how, how

There`s a high wire act on the telephone wire
And another Buddhist monk has set himself on fire
There`s a fakir outside being buried alive
Maria`s mad aunt has yet to arrive
A dahlia that dances, and a frog with wings,
A bear in a tutu that just loves to sing, karaoke 

Maria loves her life, and that`s all, and that`s all, and that`s all.

Brian Evans,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,1999
Brian Evans,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

As the battle lines are drawn and the kingdoms choosing sides
Concealed from his light abandon all that unifies

Been fooled so long by the lies of this unholy adversary
Flee the lies, the godhead has been split, exiled by mankind
Although we're out of reach

As the battle lines are drawn
And the kingdoms choosing sides
Concealed from his light abandon all that unifies
Been fooled so long by the lies of this unholy adversary

How can we free this world, it soon will melt away
As we await the wrath of a God betrayed
How can we free this world, it soon will melt away
As we await the wrath of a God betrayed

Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial
Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial

Alone I am feeling caught within it's wind
When I noticed all hope is lost and blown away
Never knowing what may come
Never showing what's been done

Realized potential so long in denial
Cast off this shadow, escaping Belial
Redemption of the forgotten
Redemption of the forgotten

How can we free this world, it soon will melt away
As we await the wrath of a God betrayed
How can we free this world, it soon will melt away
As we await the wrath of a God betrayed

Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial
Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial

Brian Fallon,"Most of this life's been a drag of a high
And lows like a blow in a paid thrown title fight
Most of my sins were born in a kiss on a night like this
Calling all lonely hearts

Don't you want a life like we saw on the picture show?
So come on, give me something, come on, keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life

My love seems that it goes from a dream
To a crash and a roll, just shaking up everyone
Maybe there's more than the treasures we secure
That become heavy chains, to sink us in tidal waves

And all I could do is take you from the circus show
So come on give me something, come on keep me up all night

You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life

And all my nights they always end the same (with the blacktop, blacktop)
Coming from behind
It's just the age-old game from the living dead buzzing in my head
They keep me up all night

I'm writing you from the beach where I'm living
I got a disco outside of my window
I love all these kids, but the good times are killing me

I got a picture of you on the dashboard
So I can feel like you're watching right over me
I hope someday you're gonna move to the city
'Cause the lights in this town, they don't brighten up anything

And they say such foolish things, like love, love, love, love is all you need
But everything inside is saying 'Danger, baby, love's gonna leave'
So I played your sympathy, have mercy on me
'Cause I been hurt, I been stung, by the good name of love, 'til I threw my own heart in the sea

Among other foolish things

And I don't mind the nights and the low light
We spin 'round like records in the apartment
You still remind me of Marianne Faithfull
Lookin' like a picture taken outta the sixties

And we say such foolish things, like 'Love love love, love is all we need
But everything inside is saying, danger, baby, love's gonna leave
So I played your sympathy, be patient with me
'Cause I been hurt, I been stung, by the good name of love, 'til I threw my own heart in the sea

Among other foolish things

And we believe such foolish things, like 'Love love love, love is all we need'

See I don't dig those kind of blues anymore, she said

Is that an invitation to use my love in your man's man's world?

Brian Fallon,"I built a room for you in the back of my mind
Where the ravenous wolves and the ghosts I know reside
You were amazing, you were always on my mind
We were secrets to keep, crows buried side-by-side

It was cool in the night, I was old as a stone
In the back of a car with a child at heart
Who suddenly showed you their teeth

But you say, I’m alright
Baby, I don’t mind
I’ll get on just fine
On them long, long drives

I keep a letter you wrote before the devil came in the picture
Says, I've got you now, wrapped around my finger
And into the mystic, we were blue and outrageous
And every night, I would race the Moon and fall for you
'Cause you ache for a drug a that'll never be enough
You're never gonna feel like when he first picked you up
When he drove you around, bought you powder and flowers
Until the thrill was gone

But you said, I’m alright
Baby, I don’t mind
I’ll get on just fine
On them long, long drives

Last night I remembered being seventeen
I met a girl with a taste for the world and whiskey and rites of spring
Spent every night with cassettes that she liked
In a car that I borrowed a lot
And I could never get her to believe

And maybe we believed in very, very foolish things
Maybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow

Brian Gold,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.

Say you really love me, darlin';

Brian Gold,"Lately baby, I've been thinking
How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking
For once I feel my head is clear

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
The love we had stays on my mind
The love we had stays on my mind

And lately girl, I've been remembering
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending
And memories of you are everywhere

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern
You win some, you lose some
Well I've lost and I've learned
Sisqo's so lonely
With no place to turn
And here at the end, I find
Yes I do

The love we had stays on my mind
Girl, if you were nearer
If you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears

And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
How I wish, how I wish
How I wish that you were here

And baby girl I was tired
So I laid down to dream for a little while
But lately I've been so, so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile

But I'm not complaining
Cuz that's how it goes
There's always some heartache
In this world I suppose
But you can't imagine
But nobody knows

I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasn't right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky, like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
But now I see it's time to get a handle
And take control of things
So for me - I'm a light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love, so I ought give my thanks first

Yeah, I know you dig what I'm relayin'
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I ain't saying that I don't do no wrong
I'm saying I ain't trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
I'm building with my family; my loved ones depend on me
I've got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner power's too strong
To let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But I'd rather seek the truth to be found
Than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs, feel the vibes; I'm tryin' to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who can't find a open door

Now as we head into the year two thousand
And more and more people can't even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
And poor employment structures, so some choose illegal tools
By all means, you know we must survive, but think
The energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing we'll hear is the cries and the screaming voices

Brian Holt,"""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Bahamadia] 
I'm mystical; don't be deceived by the visual 
Visible preference is pure; patent it back to metaphors 
Greetin' 'em Illa del style wild 
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on eight, four poetic meter 
Soarin' way beyond 
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam 
Unsyncopated soul, piercin' earlobes and egos 
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore? 
To the grain

[Guru] 
Lame-game, plain-Jane emcees can't approach these 
I shake chumps like fleas; I hold the keys 
To drive you, guide you, provide you 
With the real joints; ahem, I clear my throat of phlegm 
The architect, selecting the blueprints 
To rid the game of nuisance 
Sucker reducin' with the fusion 
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution 
Stackin' concrete flows; look out below 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles 
Most emcees couldn't see me with bifocal spectacles 
There's no protectin' you; with realness, I'm wreckin' you 
I'm beggin' you - take a look into the cipher 
You're dirt on my windshield, so I'm turnin' on my wipers 
And I can see clearly now 
No other rapper is near me 
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

[Bahamadia] 
Never flip folklores, only realness 
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck 
Respect the architect in this division 
Rhymes written to be hittin' like anti-proton collisions 
Rap newest edition, bringin' the feminine in renditions 
In rare form, defined as optimal for my pedigrees 
In skill three like three-sixty degrees as in well-rounded 
Leavin' the competition dumb-founded 
For when I catch wreck, I astound 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Floor to ceiling, constantly building 
With power to construct towers of rap cream, kid; what? 
Dreamin' you're lyrical, physical, mystical? 
Your concept's mediocre, plus you're way too typical withcha 
Corny delivery and crazy, whack voice 
Mad corny image; that's why I give you jitters 
It figures I'd have to dust you off the scene 
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean

[Bahamadia] 
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate 
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create 
Top notch and on lock like Sentry; opponents could never tempt me 
Samplin' my style like an Akai S-950, and still can't get with me 
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic 
Conductin' phonics like the Philharmonics 
I make in measured melody; kids praise me like the crucifix 
So place Bahamad' amongst your top ten of emcees 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Yeah, neverending, knah I'm sayin? Always buildin'
My homegirl Bahamadia in the hidouse, yeah, yeah
And of course, my man the legend
Ramsey Lewis
So respect the architect, knah I'm sayin?

Incognito; that's how I flow

Well, I'm here for you
Are you there?  Where? 
Takin' peeks, and sneakin' winks; whatever brotherman thinks

Gettin' through in time and time

First day, guess what Guru said to me?
Dark and lovely, how could you be?
It is right for me
Because, whiny, whiny, me whiny sexy
All de man - dem just-a rush me

Check it out 
The time is right; you hold me tight (my love) 
In the twilight, away from the spotlight 
We can explore mysteries that last all night (trust me) 
Nobody has to know but us 
Honey, you know I'm the man 
Baby, for you I got big plans (eh, eh) 

[Big Shug]
You say I'm just a lonely man (no more) 
But tomorrow I'll be your king; the ruffneck swing 
You know me from my name on the streets 
You want to be with me; it's easy to see 
Since you kissed me on the cheek 
Now you want to be my everyday freak (hah hah!)

[Kool Keith] 
Lookin' at me, my man and him, my man and him 
Champagne pop; don't waste time; you can get with him (meow) 
We got some drinks; you lookin' at the fine wine 
Eye contact is on; all I see is sihlouette 
Sheer plastic; freaky so fantastic (it's like dat) 
I want to touch it, see if it's real 
True at heart, I want to see how you really feel 
Take off your mask and reveal...

Brian Hyland,"I'm afraid to go home
I'm afraid to go home
Worries on my mind
Afraid of what I'll find

Will my family be gone
I'm afraid to go home
Back to Tennessee
Afraid of what I'll see

As I walk down this dusty road
Got a heart with a heavy load
Ain't a thing that's the same
So much sorrow and pain

Heading home in a single file
Every inch is a quarter mile
Ain't heard nobody sing
Ain't seen one living thing

Someone's waiting for me
Honey sweet as can be
Wanna hold her tight
Lord, make her be all right

Maybe 'round the next bend
All the ashes'll end
Valleys will be green
Instead of what I've seen

I'm afraid for the scrubby pine
Aw, the sweet honeysuckle vine
I'm afraid for my home
For the fields that I roamed

Kick along down a homeward road
And your heart's gotta take the load
I'm afraid to go home
I'm afraid to go home

Brian Johnson,"Ah, me name is Jackie White and I'm foreman of the yard,
And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
Why I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if yer late,
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide.
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift,
And I'd expect ye's all to back us to the hilt.
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late,
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built.
We built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen,
Super tankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen,
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

All the platers and the welders, and the boiler making crews,
When they see that bugger finished on the slipway,
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not,
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day.
It's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen,
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday.
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in yer stride,
But you wonder if you'll see another payday.

For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride,
And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide,
For there's a sadness in the leavin' and ye worry what's ahead,
And that worry never leaves ye, keeps on nagging in yer head,
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till yer dead…
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed,
And the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And I don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Adrian Sanderson and riveting's me trade,
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for,
And I may forego English grammar when I'm injured with a hammer,
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor.

I've read the Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well,
I read Tacitus and Pliny and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
I put a night shift in with Dante on his journey into Hell,
And that's what we'll all be facing if the yard's put up to sell,
For the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Now what about those Trojan wars? And the troubles that they caused?
When they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?

[Tommy Thompson]
Aye, the ship they had was crap and they'd lost the effin' map,
When they tried to get their selves back to the toon.

[Adrian Sanderson]
There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past,
Just like in ""Spartacus"" that film by Stanley Kubrick.
First it's tragedy then farce then they'll kick you in the arse,
When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris.

Well it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhymin' and the meter,
And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard.
If I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time,
All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme,
And I never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime,
And rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime,
But the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union,
Me dream is proletarian revolution,
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others,
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution.

Das Kapital's me bible and the ruling class are liable,
And quoting Marx and Engels, it's entirely justifiable,
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

So it's a one-day stoppage, or an overtime ban,
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan.
'Til the means of production are safely in our hands,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards,
When they try to close us down like other shipyards.
And if industrial action only helps the competition,
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position,
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition,
Well ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns!
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard.

My name is Peggy White,
And I've nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds I've bound.
Busted arms, and busted heads,
Broken backs and broken legs,
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground.
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung,
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue,
I could give you's all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs,
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Arthur Cook, I'm the Union superintendent,
Where I represent the interests of ye's all.
And I listen to you men as you talk about the future,
But the truth is that we're heading for a God almighty fall.
But it's clear that intervention's not the government's intention,
'Cos they've got no need for ships, now have I got your full attention?
While the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension,
I'm the one who sees the writin' on the shipyard wall.

I've begged and I've pleaded at every meeting that we've held,
That we limit our demands to this reality,
It's like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld,
And there's nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity.
There's nowt for us to bargain with when the industry's at sea,
It must be obvious to you as it's obvious to me,
And my advice to all of you's is to take redundancy,
And accept that there's no future in this shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two,
You could ask me when it started but I haven't got a clue.
I'm never sad or miserable I'm never ever blue,
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard.

I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds,
And then the missus starts complainin' about all me drunken deeds,
Like when I got the train to Sunderland but found meself in Leeds,
And I had to get up early for the shipyard.

I once gave up the drinking, was it 1963?
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me,
It was the worst three hours I ever hope to see…

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And the ship sets sail and the tale gets told,
And the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll get the bastard finished, and we'll end up on the dole.
And we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
The only life we've ever known is in the shipyard.",Shipyard,2013
Brian Johnson,"Me first day in the shipyard, the gaffer says to me,
""I want ye to go to the store lad and get a few things, ye see?
Now here's a list, can ye read lad? Can ye read it back to me?
And me and the boys'll listen while were having wah morning tea.""

Now reading was me pride when I left school at fourteen,
There wouldn't be no problem here, I'd show them I was keen,
But when I starts to reading, they just couldn't hold their mirth,
Hugging themselves and spluttering like they was giving birth.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
The gaffer pats me on the head and sends me on me way,
He says, ""Don't come back empty handed lad, or I'll have to dock yer pay.""

So I gets to the store all nervous and the quartermaster's there,
I pulls the list out of me pocket and I starts to read all square,
Well I hadn't barely finished when the store-man's face turns red,
He gives me such an evil look I thought I'd soon be dead.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
The store-man swipes me on the head and sends me on me way,
With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first day.

I gets back home that evening and me mother says to me,
""How was it son? How was your day? Sit down and have some tea.""
I told her of the list I'd read and the trouble I was in,
I couldn't go back tomorrow or the gaffer'd have me skinned.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
Me mother swipes me on the head and sends me on me way,
With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first day.",Sky Hooks and Tartan Paint,2013
Brian Johnson,"The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
The lamb has overcome

If there are words for Him, then I don't have them.
You see my brain has not yet reached the point.
Where it could form a thought that could adequately
describe the greatness of my God
And my lungs have not yet developed the ability to,
release a breathe with enough to agility to
breathe out the greatness of His love
And my voice, you see my voice is so inhibited
Restrained by human limits,
that's hard to even send the praise up
You see if there are words for Him,
I don't have them
My God, His grace is remarkable
Mercies are innumerable
Strength is impenetrable
He is honorable, accountable
Favorable, He's unsearchable yet knowable
Indefinable yet approachable
Indescribable yet personal
He is beyond comprehension
Further than imagination
Constant through generations
King of every nation
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
You see my words are few
In trying to capture the one true God
Using my vocabulary would never do
But I use words as an expression,
An expression of worship to a Savior
A Savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise
So I use words
My heart extols the Lord. Blesses His name forever.
He has won my heart, Captured my mind
And has bond them both together
He is defeated me in my rebellion
Conquered me in my sin
He has welcomed me into His presence
Completely invited me in
He has made Himself the object of my sight
Flooding me with mercies in the morning
Drowning me with grace in the night
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
But what I do have is, good news
For my God knew that manmade words
Would never do, the words are just tools
That we use to point to the truth
So He sent His son Jesus Christ
As The Word, living proof
He is the image of the invisible God
The first born of all creation
For by Him all things were created
Giving nothingness formation
And by His words He sustains
In the power of His name
For He is before all things
And over all things He reigns
Holy is His name
So praise Him for His life
The way he preserved in strife
The humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice
Praise Him for His death (pause)
That He willingly stood in our place
That He lovingly endured the grave
That He battled our enemy
And on the third day rose in Victory
He is everything that was promised
Praised as the risen King
Lift your voice and sing
For one day He will return for us
And we will finally be united with our Savior
For eternity, eternity
So it's not just words that I proclaim
For my words point to The Word
And The Word has a name
Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
And that name is Jesus Christ
Praise His name forever",Forever (We Sing Hallelujah),2018

No, wait! 
We need a more permanent solution to our problem.

What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth? 
Miracle wonderman, hero of fools.

PRIEST THREE 

No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans.

CAIAPHAS

One thing I'll say for him -- Jesus is cool.

ANNAS

We dare not leave him to his own devices. 
His half-witted fans will get out of control.

But how can we stop him? 
His glamour increases 
By leaps every moment; he's top of the poll.

I see blood and destruction,

How do we deal with a carpenter king?

Where do we start with a man who is bigger 
Than John was when John did his baptism thing?

Fools, you have no perception! 
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high! 
We must crush him completely, 
So like John before him, this Jesus must die.

Brian Kennedy,"I awoke with a fright from a terrible dream
We were performers way up on a flying trapeze
The spotlight followed our silvery swings
There were fanfares and drumrolls and everything
Then it came to the part where we meet in midair
And I held out my hands but your hands weren't there
And I fell, and I fell
That's when I woke with a fright 
From that terrible dream
And you were there by my side like you've always been
I wondered what it meant and I answered ‘who knows'
Just insecure I suppose 

It's a frightening and dangerous thing
To give your heart to someone
Your relax, turn your back
And they're gone 

“Three hundred lost' the newsreader said
In a wayward flight bound for Australia today
I knew you weren't planning no Australian trip
But I called the airport anyway
As the girl ran her fingers down the passenger list
I swear someone could have lived off the heartbeats I missed
And I prayed, oh I prayed
That's when I heard you whistling as you walked in the door
Whistling and walking like always before
And I wondered was I mad and I answered ‘who knows'
Just insecure I suppose 

It's a frightening and dangerous thing
To give your heart to someone
Your relax, turn your back

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can

Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side
I will find a place to rest my spirit if I can perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain but I will remain and I will be back again",Highwayman,2003

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Not too tall, 5'8""
She held up a coloured copy, photograph
From his wedding day
And this is his pregnant wife
Carrying his last dream
He walked down 46 floors before he felt the rush
The rush of gasoline

I can feel the pain
Looking in their eyes
But I don't know gone without good-bye
If I could reach the sky
I'd bring him right back to your arms
Though I haven't seen your son, he's forever in my life

Have you seen my little girl?
She's got curly black hair
She took this Raggedy-Ann doll, everywhere
Last I saw her over there
Then I heard a plight of screams
And a speeding van
I watched these tears pour down
A father's last attemp of being a rational man

Though I can feel the pain
Look into his eyes
But I don't know gone without good-bye
If I could reach the sky I'd bring her right back to your arms
Though I haven't seen your girl, she's forever in my life

Mm mm, Ohh

And have you seen my faith?
It can run, it can hide
Jesus mend this breaking heart of mine
That keeps on loving life

Though I can feel the pain

So that we could see the face of forever

To feel Your healing in Your touch

Wish I could have been there
Just to see You, Jesus, face to face

To hear You pray in the garden alone
Laying down Your will with each tear
To see You walk that lonely road
Willing to die for me

And in that moment
I know I should have been there
You took my cross and gave Your life
And You live again, and You live again

Wish I could have been there
My only wish is to see You rise again
Wish I could have been there

Brian Littrell,"When I left home to be who I am
Some people said ""No Way""
But I laid it all down, gave everything
In my head rang the words that my father said

You're never far
I will be where you are
And when you come to me
I will open my arms

Welcome Home, you
I know you by name
How do you do?
I shine because of you today
So come and sit down
Tell me how you are
I know son, it's good just to see your face.

When I look at you holding my heart
I will give to you all that I have
Son I know there'll be times
You will feel all alone
I will share with you the words my father said

You're never far
I will be where you are
And when you come to me
You can bet I will open my arms

Welcome Home, you
I know you by name
How do you do?
I shine because of you today
So come and sit down
Tell me how you are
I know son, it's good just to see your face

Said I've been waiting for that day
Just to feel your warm embrace
Your love has shown
I will never be alone
You will welcome me home

I'll forever be
You will say to me
Welcome Home, you
I know you by name
How do you do?
I shine because of you today

Brian Locking,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",2005

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on

Never let the money and these broads break us
We right here till the Lord take us
We act a fool cause the laws make us
Baby, you can't stop the hustle'

[Backbone]
You walk your ass 'cross my yard, get off my grass
You want to get to that money, get off yo' ass
You wants to know my name, you wants to ask
If you want to see me for something, it's going cost ya cash
I see ya poking outcha jeans girl you acting bad
Oh, do that again with you nasty ass
I caught her coming out the mall, with 2 or 3 bags
Now shorty got her at the wood shack, throwing her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubble bath
Catch me somewhere outta town signing autographs
Still working street corners, straight serving them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Chevrolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats
And I'm on the microphone with Gipp, Slimm, and Cass

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Gipp]
Since the trashman only run once a week
If I miss it, I'm wait 'til night and dump it up the street,
behind the Winn-Dixie
Quiver, never step or kept up his penny drawers
To get an applause, appeared to have no flaws
In the situation, no dentition, smelling good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touching up would be too easy
 
Sleazy, measly, looking ugly like a person trying to sell me a dub
Fool A, see, D, and me
Trees ain't my reason for sending your ass to grave and
Watch you say the grade is,
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)
Get the gas to go, at the corner sto'
Keep my hand on the nine piece
In case somebody want to disturb the peace (Always keeping my eyes open)
Cause you, can't, stop the hustle

[Chorus: x2]

[Slimm Calhoun]
Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbing, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out mugging like I'm holding twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block,
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste, just for the taste

[Chorus: x4]

Uh-uh (Uh-huh)
Baby, you can't stop the hustle'",Believe That,2001
Brian Lynch,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1986

Told me so well you knew

Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Just thrill me through and through,

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,

Your head back on my shoulder

To the days i had you here

Something to help me ease the pain
Can I come in from the rain

A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A Kino Runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift...nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Brian May,"Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

You take my breath away
You take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say my love

Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today I am unafraid

Oh, take my breath away
You take my breath away

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

You take my breath away my love
Take my breath away
You take my breath away

We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?  Do we distort the facts?

Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean

Like everything I touch falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well imma cut to the chase

I used to wish on a star but nowadays I need space: satellites
See the black shades white chain, flashing lights
Never thought I could of felt this low in the highlights
So I asked Phyllis its still another day in paradise
Is the heaven for the forever twenty seven
Could it be three years till I'm jammin' with legends?
I got thousands of fans, but I don't get the obsession
There's a nice guy inside, I guess I've never met him

Cause I could buy a fast car but not even an aeroplane can seem to get me out of here
The pressure and the stress are both dying to see the end of me
And the man in the mirror is looking at me like an enemy

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Naho
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, cause

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now

Cause I'm living like a rockstar
I ain't afraid the good die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Mama always told that there's someone looking over me
Think she meant the guy with the camera tryna photo me
Be careful what you wish for, cause the truths a little different
If the guardian's my angel, why's the sun burning holes in me?
They let me loose on the public, but I didn't prepare
I get shock by a lens everytime I appear
Put a star in the room, I swear it changes the atmosphere
Cause I'm a celebrity, can someone get me out of here

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time

Don't let em tell you how to live your life, cause

Before our last farewell

When I was watching the TV
Lo and behold on tight
There you were singing about me
It was a lonely summer freedom
How you had to fly away
You said you'd never change
You'd never change your mind
But then I closed my eyes
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me

I still dream the same dream
But I still wonder why
Things are not what they seem
I still hear you saying baby
You will never stay the night
I guess you never change

We'd still be playing baseball
Mixing Big Red and Red Man
On the left side of the infield

And both D'Amico sisters
Would be sitting in the bleachers
And we'd ask them to the movies
Instead of acting like two big deals

My friend, if we were sixteen again

If we were sixteen again
I'd suggest we study harder
Maybe be a little smarter
And not so hell-bent

Drink a few more Sun-Drops
Leave the Mad Dog to the winos
Ride around with our shirts off
Man, we looked good back then

Old friend, if we were sixteen again
If we were sixteen again

I guess, we thought we'd live forever
Thought we'd always be together
And things would never change, oh, no

If we were sixteen again
Well, I'd have stood up to you
Told you, you weren't drivin'
Took your keys and drove you home

And I'd tell you that I loved you
Like you were my own brother
And I'd be talking to you now
Instead of this headstone

The preacher prayed a month for rain

We'd been dry for seven weeks or more

Now it ain't stopped for thirteen days

I guess he got what he was prayin' for


So go tell the boys in the canyon

And go tell the boys at the mill

We'll throw the sand into those bags

And fight this thing until it all comes floodin' down


There's not much time left we can buy

The water's strong and on the rise

Pretty soon the dam will yield

To it's weight and drown the fields


So go tell the boys in the canyon

And go tell the boys at the mill

We'll throw the sand into those bags

And fight this thing until it all comes floodin' down


When the water comes

It takes everything you know

The houses and the harvest

Your sanity and soul

With a muddy rush

It'll baptize this whole town

When it all comes floodin' down


The preacher's on his knees again

He's prayin' for the rain to end

Now we did all that we could do

But still the water broke on through


It took all the boys in the canyon

It took all those boys from the mill

And fought that thing until it all came floodin' down

No one knows me but they know my name
That's not real to me

Hotel lobby to the aeroplane
Another country but they start to look the same
Watch the world behind a windowpane
That's not real to me

When I see my babies run
When all the madness has been and gone
I raise my family and live in peace
Now that's what's real to me
Real to me

Dying flowers in a dressing room
A dangerous time to let your head make up its own mind
Got me thinking that the spirit's flown 
That's not real to me

When I see my babies run
When all the madness has been and gone
I raise my family and live in peace
Now that's what's real to me

Picnics in the garden and the children they can play
The first day of the summer and I laze here all the day
And we'll invite the family ‘round and drink some English tea
Then I raise up me finger and watch football on TV

Now that's what's real to me

When I see my babies run
When all the madness has been and gone
I raise my family and live in peace

In the moonlight, wishing as I may
And I might have just one night with you, pretty mama
Showdown, not ready but willing
To slow down, 'cause I want to please you
I'll be around, after the lovin' is through

But if we move too fast
Will we wake up bein' strangers?
We've got time, let it pass

Don't get me wrong, 'cause I want you
More than you know, but let me get to know you
Make my heart show what my feelings show
Then I'll get closer to you

But I'm just so helpless against your touch
I'm defenseless, you're makin' me weak

And nothing in this world could keep me away

Darlin', finally I've waited so long for you to come to me
Darlin', with each passing day, there's nothing left to say

Can I open the shades? You ask me why
So we can have the moon and the stars as our only light
Cherish the moment, let's take our time

Passion flies across the room
The sweet aroma of true love in bloom
Softly I whisper, ""Forever be mine""

Oh now I see, you're everything I dreamed of now it's reality
Oh love's so rare, now it's ours to share
It's me for only you and only you for me so

To help you with a problem
To kiss your hurt if you should happen to fall down
Fall down

But when I'm gone
I need you here to carry on
My son I know you will be strong
Like a burning flame
You're my claim
That's why you've got my name

And just to show
Come what may I love you so
And there will come a day
When all that's mine is yours

Before I leave it all behind

Counting every minute that I was gone

After you would hug me so tender

And your never at home
By the time I get to see you
You need your time alone

Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way love goes

Staring at a photograph of you and I inframed
When I blink my eyes you start to fade away
Oh, I recall that day in fall and all the things you said
All of the promises that you never kept
Lately you got so much to do
And you're never at home
When I finally get to see you
You need you're time alone

A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe
It conquers all, it changes everything

They say it's a blessing, they say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle
And I believe that it is
It conquers all, but it's a mystery

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away so easily

In this world we've created
Where this place that we lived
In a blink of an eye the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the love that´s for eternity

Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears of pain, and it turns it in
To the beauty that remains

Look at this place
It was paradise, but now it's dying
I´ll brave the love
I´ll take, my chances that it´s not too late

Love brakes your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily

Oh oh oh

Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears and the pain, and turns it in
To the beauty that remains",Love Is [Instrumental],1993

Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein' hand-fed

Starin', but not carin', about, what you wearin'

The only thing I can do
Is kiss your love goodbye

Why, why should I look deep inside
To find where I went wrong, girl
'Cause after all, you'll still be gone
Oh how I've tried
Though I gave my best to you
You were determined to leave
And there's nothing I can do
Guess that none of my dreams won't come true

[Chorus]

I won't ask you why
(I won't ask you why)
Give me back my pride
'Cause time will mend
The heart that you've broken, baby
I'll let you go
Though I love you so
I'll find a way to kiss your love goodbye

[Chorus]

I guess it wasn't meant to be
I gave my all, you've tried
And now I see
The love caught my eye
I went blind
]Now it makes me cry
The only thing I can do
Is kiss your love
Is kiss your love
Is kiss your love goodbye

I was gonna get it one way or the other

That you've become the biggest part of me
And I could never leave you for another

Had a man, and she didn't mind 
Walked up to me nice and slow 
What she wanted 
I did not know 
Gave me her pager number 
And said call her ""anytime"" 
Then she whispered in my ear

Doesn't take her anywhere 
Used to say sweet things 
Acts like he doesn't even care 
He thinks that she's content 
'cause he buys her cars 
And he pays her rent 
But she's not ready to leave 
She turned and said to me 

[Chorus]

I wouldn't treat you that way 
If you were my lady 
I wouldn't share you 
You'd be mine and mine alone, oh yeah 
If he continues wastin' your time 
Girl, he's crazy 
I'll take her

Maxine looked into my eyes 
Wanted me to be the other guy

When pleasure can be found
In and all around
The right place is on the floor
Why don't we get down on the floor

If we get down on the floor

Will have me doing cartwheels and flips

Where this place that we lived

Love lights the world
Unites the love that's for eternity

Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears of pain, and it turns it in
To the beauty that remains

Look at this place
It was paradise, but now it's dying
I'll brave the love
I'll take, my chances that it's not too late

make-believe and fairy tails were real.

Baby  won't you show me the way back to your heart 

Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far 

Lead me back to the road 

That leads back to your arms 

Every night another lonely street 

I walk down alone 

Searching for a light 

Your light to lead me home 

Leave a candle in the window 

And let it shine for me 

Take my hand and take these tears away 

I can't take the pain 

I'm on my knees begging you please 

Chorus 

Take my hand 

Take me in your arms 

I'm out in the dark 

Down on my knees, begging you please

I remember the way you used to touch me all the time
I told you how I was the luckiest man alive
And now I hear you showin' off your new boy
And frontin' like everything's alright

Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
(Oh)
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(yeah oh)
I just keep denying till I get over you

Endless times I stayed up all night waiting for you to call
Lying to myself 'cause you weren't thinking 'bout me at all
My eyes are holding back the tears
My pride won't let you see me act a fool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let you know that I still feel something for you

Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Oh)

(I get over you, till I get over you, baby)
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Yeah, crying)
I just keep denying till I get over you
(Yeah, over you baby, oh)

Can't forget the way we touched
(Every day, every night, baby)
And the way we used to make love
(I still remember how it feels)
Baby, but now it's over and you're gone
(I've got to say ""Goodbye"")
Hey, because I know, I can't go on without you

Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying

Oh, oh, gidyup

All of these flowers
For this friend of ours, it's such a shame
All of these people
All of them equally feel the same
There's silence and weeping
Looks like he's sleeping, the children say
They say he was ready, I hope he was ready
Is the prayer I'm praying

When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
Angels won't leave me behind

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes
(When the chariot, when the chariot comes)
I'm gonna be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes

Over the prairie
The pallbearers carry and lay him to rest
Satan's a cheater, Christ is the teacher
And life's the test

Oh Lord, take me higher
Never liked fire, I can't stay here
I gotta get ready, gotta get ready
Time has drawn near
When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
The angels won't leave me behind

[Chorus]

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul you keep
If I die before I wake
I pray my soul you'll take

Got to be , got to be ready, when the chariot comes

From something that was so meant to be
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now, more and more, I wonder where you are

Do I ever cross your mind, any time?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, any time?
I miss you

Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear, I hear your voice, driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say

Do I ever cross your mind, any time?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, any time?
I miss you, I miss you

No more, loneliness and heartache
No more, crying myself to sleep
No more, wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me? Come back to me

Do I ever cross your mind, any time?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, any time?

Bay Boy we dont' stop, we rock we rock
Yo,I hit you the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gig playing two point eight
Near studded, jewel flooded, got to love it
First rap cat with an R&B budget
Everyday on the TV, me and PD
Girls see PD, make their man break the CD
Why ya'll forever rowdy, I'll be outie
Somewhere in Maui, 'til I go back to Cali

Can't understand how he can treat you
The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me
Oh so baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine

If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine

Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life
Oh so, baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved

If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine

Yo, what the deal honey, insecure, feeling funny
I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PHD

Girl, come into my world
I'll love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries no more, girl open the door

Steady and strong, it does not know defeat
I feel it pound, and know the sound
Of true beliefs
In every soul, there is a memory
Of standing tall, the proudest we could be
I cannot fall, for I recall
We were born in majesty

And when the long fight, has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun

[Chorus]
And we will raise out hands
And we will touch the sky
Together we will dance in robes of gold
And we will leave the world remembering
When we were kings, when we were kings

Now is the time, here is the mountain top
When one man climbs, the rest are lifted up
With every step we're closer yet
To a higher destiny

And when we reach out to claim the thrown
Every man will know
