George Strait,"There's just a hint of indifference 
In her lack of conversation when we talk. 
And the subject matters change, 
There's no mention of our future now at all. 
She still kisses me each morning, 
But it seems more like a habit than before. 

I know she still loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore. 

She used to laugh at all my jokes, 
But lately I can't seem to make her smile. 
And the last time we made love it was good, 
But God it's been a while. 
She's always there when I get home, 
But she's no longer waiting at the door. 

I know she still loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore. 

'Cause it's just a little colder every time I hold her. 
She's just going through the motions 
From what's left of her devotion; 
And it scares me half to death 
Wonderin' what tomorrow holds in store. 

I know she still loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore. 

Right now I know she loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore.",I Know She Still Loves Me,1996
George Strait,"Baby all I've got is this beat-up leather bag
And everything I own don't fill up half
But don't you worry 'bout the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A good-bye kiss is all I need from you

'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength, for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I'll ever need
Carrying your love with me

On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds rollback and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
You're right there in everything I do

'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength, for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I'll ever need
Carrying your love with me

'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength, for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I'll ever need
Carrying your love with me",Carrying Your Love with Me,1997
George Strait,"I'm glad I had the nerve to talk to you that day
I could just have easily have let you get away
In that crowded airport far from my hometown
If I had lost my courage then you wouldn't be around
I'm glad I had the nerve

And I'm glad he had the nerve to get down on his knees
And say ""I bought this ring for you, won't you wear it please?""
My daddy sure touched somethin' in my momma's heart somehow
If he hadn't, I sure wouldn't be here with you now
I'm glad he had the nerve

Or I never would have lived like this
Or learned like this
Or laughed like this
Or loved like this

I'm glad he had the nerve to sail across the sea
My great grand-daddy's great grandpa, in 1833
He met an indian maiden, in the Smoky Mountain mist
If they hadn't crossed that line, I would not exist
I'm glad they had the nerve

And I'm glad He had the nerve, while staring into space
To give this universe a time and a place
With one tiny atom, or an Adam and an Eve
However you look at it, whatever you believe
I'm glad He had the nerve

Or we never would've live like this
Or learned like this
Or laughed like this
Or loved like this

Thank God, he had the nerve
And I'm glad I had the nerve 
To talk to you that day",The Nerve,1997
George Strait,"I'm not yours, and, baby, you're not mine

George Strait,"Still reelin' from a relationship 
That left me torn in two
Tryin' to find that first step 
That leads to someone new
Gettin' me back together
Didn't know it could be so hard
But if I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart
You look like a real good place to start

I need a new beginning
And girl you fit right in
Sometimes a new beginning
Is found in an old friend
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart
You look like a real good place to start

There've been times when you and him 
Just couldn't get along
I'd hear your knock and let you in
Be your shoulder to cry on
And now he's finally left you
And I've find you in my arms
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart
You look like a real good place to start

George Strait,"As far as all my friends can tell 
I took her leavin' well - that's kinda right
'Cause when I'm out with them 
I don't let her memory rule the night
For the most part I'm okay
But I still miss her in a round about way

Around about the time that midnight rolls around
That's around about the time my tears start falling down
'Cause she's not around
I come unwound and my heart breaks 
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way
 
I no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
Wishin' she would call 
And just the other day 
I took her smilin' face down off my wall
I've come a long long way
But I still miss her in a round about way

Around about the time that midnight rolls around
That's around about the time my tears start falling down

George Strait,"Picture a fellow with his boots shined up
A new coat of clean on his pick-up truck
Ringin' your doorbell thinkin' about love
Hey honey that's me

That's me with a capital M
That's me ten times ten
I ain't worked up my courage yet
But that's me every chance I get

Picture a fellow at a picture show
His arm around you in the very last row
Stealin' a kiss as the credits roll
Yeah honey that's me

That's me with a capital M
That's me ten times ten
Ain't worked up my courage yet
But that's me every chance I get

George Strait,"We made it final today
I gave you all I had, you made your getaway
All the love we once made
Turned to memories today
I left the courtroom and went straight to the church
I hit my knees and told god how much I hurt
Nothing left of my heart
Its gonna be so hard to make a new start

[Chorus]
Cause today my world slipped away
We buried the plans that we made
And tonight I'm alone and afraid
Cause today my world slipped away

All my friends say I'll make it alright
I'll recover and start a new life
But that'll be so hard to do
Cause living ain't worth living without you

Cause today my world slipped away",Today My World Slipped Away,1997
George Strait,"Ther'es a soft rain tappin' on your window
There's a cool breeze blowin' off the bay
And a warm flame dancin' with our shadows
To music playin' far away
I never meant to stay an hour
I thought that I was passing through
Another town along the highway
I never meant to fall for you

[Chorus]
But I can't speak for you Maria
I only know the way I feel
When I sleep with you, Maria
There's nothing left for dreams to steal

On a Bible by the mirror
The only treasures that we hold
The only secrets that we're keepin'
A watch, a chain, a cross of gold

[Chorus]

When the sunlight brings the mornin'
I can't tell you what I'll do
But I've a mind to take you with me
And I've got heart to stay with you

When I sleep with you, Maria
There's nothin' left for dreams to steal",Maria,1998
George Strait,"You've been out again tonight 
With the girls out on the town
But in those magic neon lights
I know exactly what you found
What about your home?
And the man who loves you so
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row

If you're lonely then your easy
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose
And lonely women are in season
A one night stand's an all night lose
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies
Are always putting on a show
But in the morning putting on coffee
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before
To neon row

Girl I can't hold you back
Not one day longer
If my love ain't strong enough
To keep you home
Just start the fire
To burn the bridges
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light
Down on neon row

If you're lonely then your easy
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose
And lonely women are in season
A one night stand's an all night lose
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies

George Strait,"I couldn't help but over hear your conversation
When you told her that you owned her heart and soul
You say you've got her wrapped around your finger
But there's somthin' bout angels you should know

She'll walk away one step at a time
It'll take you by surprise
You'll think it happened over night
It'll be too late when you realize
Angels don't fly
They just walk away one step at a time

Don't think that I'm tryin' to mind your business
It's a full time job just tryin' to mind mine
But I once had an angel just like her
And if I'd treated her right
She'd still be by my side

She'll walk away one step at a time
It'll take you by surprise
You'll think it happened over night

George Strait,"Girl you were always my yellow rose
And I was your one lone star
We always said
Together till death do us part

We had a love bigger than Texas
Where is that feeling now
It's taken some hits and some losses but it's fighting on
And standing somehow

Remember the man who asked for your hand
In the moonlight of San Antone
There by the mission you let your position be known
That you loved me so
Don't forget where it started 
Remember the Alamo

I think we can hold on and make it togther
If we remember when
And get back to love
The way that it was back then

When we were hopeless romantics needing eachother
Willing to take a chance
We strolled and we talked down the ol' river walk
To the heart of where it began

Remember the man who asked for your hand
In the moonlight of San Antone
There by the mission you let your position be known
That you loved me so

George Strait,"Well that's just great
Just what I needed
The icing on that cake
You're leavin'
But I give up
Throw up my hands
There's nothing I can say or do
I've done all that I can

That's the breaks
The way the cookie crumbles
What goes around comes around they say
That's the breaks
The way that ol' cookie crumbles
And what's been comin' round
Ain't been goin' my way

Well surprise me
Tell me something new
I know leavin's what I got
Comin' from you
And I'm sorry
You know I am
But one way or another I'll come through
In one piece once again

That's the breaks

George Strait,"True in this modern world, when two lovers get together
Chances of 'em ever makin' it to forever
Couldn't be better than two in a million hearts.

Girl, this ain't just another run-of-the-mill emotion.
What I'm feelin' is the definition of devotion.
My love for you is true.

True, like the sun comin' up each mornin'.
Bright as the light in a baby's smile.
Sure as the mountain river windin'.
Right as the rain fallin' from the sky.
Girl, my love for you
Is true.

True, not another minute on this earth can be borrowed,
There's no way to know when I'll live my last tomorrow.
But every day I get, I'll share with you.
This feelin' just keeps gettin' stronger as the time goes by.
It's written on my face, you can see it in my eye.
My love for you is true.

True, like the sun comin' up each mornin'.

George Strait,"You take it nice and easy
You play it safe 'cause that's what people do today
I guess that's ok
Girl somewhere in your mind
There must be a perfect time to fall in love
But baby I'm burning up

[Chorus]
So why not now, why not here? 
Darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waiting for
Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Livin' like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now

Right here in this moment
We could start a love to stand the test of time

Long gone with yesterday, so

I'm waitin' for my change of heart

I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things I need to forget
Everything's gone
But you haven't left me yet

I painted our room 
Replaced all the curtains
And there's a new rug on the floor
Called up the Good Will
Said come and get it
Everything she left behind is yours
I can still see you drivin' away
So why do I still see your face
When

I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things I need to forget

Your leaving just don't add up
It's all over for me if you go

They don't know you're packing their clothes
At least they didn't see me crying

George Strait,"I know why I'm intrigued
You keep surprisin' me
Somewhere between the lines
There's no way to define

I work hard every day to bring home all my pay
I got one house, one yard

Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.
Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,
So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down.

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know,
So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your 'frigerator door,
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you'll see it for sure.

Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.
Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,

A time to give and to receive

I know what I want for Christmas this year
I hope my note got to Santa on time
I'm a little bit nervous
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it
I'll never ask for anything more
It shines, it's new
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you

We can build a little fire
We can sit and talk for hours
We'll just have fun
You can tell me what you did
Christmas morning as a kid
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come

And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
I'm sure to get a kiss
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
To complete this singular wish
It shines, it's new
I know what I want and nothin' else will do
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you

George Strait,"Way out here you can see for miles
If there was anything to be seen
Maybe I could tell the difference between
Where I am and where I've been

So if I stare off in the distance sometimes
And get that far away look in my eye
It's that my baby went and left me out there
All alone in the middle of nowhere

Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere

Standin' at the edge of the sky
On top of a mountain so tall
Wishin' to God I could fly, fly, fly
When I ain't even done climbin' the wall

Could you help me let the teardrops roll
Awe anything to cleanse my soul
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere

Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere

From Atlanta in '53
And I picked up a Rhythm & Blues magazine

And Pat Boone to take me home

You're gonna pull my string
Make it the real thing

And when young Johnny Cash hadn't seen this side of 
Big River yet
And old Luther and Lewis and Perkins was picking

Full of curves, lessons learned at every bend
Goin's rough unlike the straight and narrow

Have no fear, dare to dream of a change
Live to march to the beat of a different drummer
And it all might come together
And it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled

For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far
Me I wanna live my life and one day leave my mark
And it all might come together
And it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled

I've chosen a pathway I may not endure
One thing's for certain nothin's for sure
And it all might come together
Or it all might come unraveled

For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far

A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

I thought I'd take a ride,

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight

Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

When you're in love

Don't miss Jamaica Joe's
You can dine out fresco
Then dance in the street till the sun comes up
You can take a barefoot cruise
Share a moonlight made for two
There's so little time and so much to see and do
When you're in love

Be sure and take, lots of pictures when you're there
Be sure and make, lots of memories trust me

I need a friend to see me through

George Strait,"Nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.
They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.
But someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.
They got away with murder down on music row.

The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang 
(oh, you tell them Alan).
They all say not guilty, but the evidence will show
That murder was committed down on music row.

For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,
But drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed up in your face.
Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
Since they committed murder down on music row.

They thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still buy'em)
Well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold
Murder's been committed down on music row.

Oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles play
With drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face
Why, the Hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio

Why, they even tell the Possum to pack up and go back home

Hard to get through, since you've been gone
So I do the only thing I know how to, to get by

To keep the sun out and off my face
Friends stop by to check-in 'cause I've checked out
I tell them I'm fine, I'm living for the night

I can't hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbyes
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I'm living for the night

I'm a whole lot easier to talk to,
When I've had a few, I settle down
Whiskey kills the man you've turned me into
And I come alive

'Cause it makes them taste better than they did at first

Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss

Before she gets the icing put on

That you might have overlooked or missed

That says, I'm sorry, I know I was wrong
I can't find the words that don't make it cheap
It's right on the verge and just out of reach
It must be a sad song with a blue melody
And I'll bet you it's lonesome, as lonesome as can be
But I'm starting to wonder if there's such a thing
As a sad song that's too sad to sing

Maybe tonight, maybe this time tomorrow
Me and this guitar will get right with this sorrow
And I'll play it for you, and you'll come back to me
'Cause you were always a fool for the blue melodies

So it must be a sad song in three quarter time
That chills down to the bone when the steel guitars cry
But if it's not the one that brings you home to me
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing

Shattered lives still reeling from the pain
Of plans and dreams now gone

There's someone who's looking after me
Someone beside me night and day

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing

And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end

Where I grew up riding next to you, learning everything I know
I noticed just how green things were when I pulled through the gate
Like the greener pastures up there where we'll meet again someday
Wish I'd have thought to slip a phone in the pocket of your suit
When the good Lord called you home on that sunny day in June

Then I could send a picture of all the things you touched
To think a man who led such a simple life could leave behind so much
It's just a lot of little things but they mean the world to me
Everywhere I look there's one more memory
There's a little bit of you in everything I see

Seems to rain now all the time, hadn't seen this much in years
Didn't take you long to send back home some answers to our prayers
A lot of things are different now but so much is still the same
And I accidentally dial your number almost every day
Wish I'd have thought to slip a phone in the pocket of your suit
When the good Lord called you home on that sunny day in June

If somehow you could find that cloud with my stuff locked away
Dust it off and you could see the things I send you everyday

Yeah, I could send a picture of your great-grandson growing up
Tell you one more time I love you and that I miss you so much

Two hundred years ago
Where a pride rose from the ashes of San Jacinto
It still beats in every heart
Like a battle cry
Where I was born, where I was raised, so when I die

Take me to Texas, on the open range
The Rio Grande is in my veins
It’s heaven there and so my prayer
Is that you’ll take me anywhere in Texas
The only home I know
I’m a child of the Alamo and the Yellow Rose
So when I go

Take me to Texas
Where my daddy worked
Where his blood and sweat and tears are still in that red dirt
Wild Palominos run
Cowboys are kings
And if I stray too far, I’ll let my Lone Star dreams

Take me to Texas, on the open range
The Rio Grande is in my veins
It’s heaven there and so my prayer
Is that you’ll take me anywhere in Texas
The only home I know
I’m a child of the Alamo and the Yellow Rose
So when I go, take me to Texas

There’s something in the sky
And in your momma’s eyes
So even if you try to move away
You’ll end up on some road somewhere
With your thumb up in the air
When they ask you where you’re headed, you’ll just say

Take me to Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antone
Houston, Laredo, Galveston
Or Austin, maybe Abilene
The closest thing I’ve ever seen
To Heaven’s the Gulf of Mexico

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

George Thorogood,"As I got on a city bus and found my vacant seat
I thought, I saw my future bride strolling up the street
I shouted to the driver, ""Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think, I see her, please let me off this bus""

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, baby where are you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you're up to something new

Well, I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walking toward a coffee colored Cadillac
Pushing through the crowd trying to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, darling where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new

Well, downtown searching for her, looking all around
I saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
Caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him, ""Catch that yellow cab""

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, baby where are you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you've got something else to do

Well, downtown searching for her, looking all around

Oh, Nadine, honey where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new

Well now, she moves around like a wayward summer breeze
Go, go driver catch upon me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted Cavalier
I'm leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow

In the hot joint takin' the pill
There walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill

You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes so my name's is Billy Lee

If you've got a warrant you better read it to me

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail

They stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail

I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
Said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court
Into the courtroom my trial began

Where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree

I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me

Way back up in the woods

In a gunny sack

That the drivers made
People passing by
They would stop and say

About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday,
Had to tell the landlady I'd-a lost my job
She said that don't confront me,
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent,
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady,
I said, ""You let me slide?""
I'll have the rent for you in a month.
Next I don't know
So said let me slide it on you know people,
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me,
But for five year she was so nice
Loh' she was lovy-dovy,
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said, ""You got the rent money yet?"",
I said, ""No, can't find no job""
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent
She said ""I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job""
Said ""I seen you today you was standin' on a corner,
Leaning up against a post""
I said ""But I'm tired, I've been walkin' all day""
She said ""That don't confront me,
Long as I get my money next Friday""
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent,
And out the door I went

So I go down the streets,
Down to my good friend's house
I said ""Look man I'm outdoors you know,
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?""
He said ""Let me go and ask my wife""
He come out of the house,
I could see it in his face
I know that was no
He said ""I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, you know""
I said ""I know, everybody funny, now you funny too""
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent
She said ""Yeah?"" I said ""Oh yeah""
And then she was so nice,
Loh' she was lovy-dovy
So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go,
I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go
She a-howlin' about the front rent, she'll be lucky to get any back rent,
She ain't gonna get none of it
So I stop in the local bar you know people,
I go to the bar, I ring my coat, I call the bartender
Said ""Look man, come down here"", he got down there
So what you want?

George Thorogood,"Well I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said ""ooh-eee""
It looks like a purple eater to me

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)

Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
I wouldn't eat you cuz you're so tough

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One horn?)

I said Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line
He said it's eatin' purple people and it sure is fine
But that's not the reason that I came to land
I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater
(We wear short shorts)
Flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
He started to rock, really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
Sing a boop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater
I like short shorts
Flyin' little people eater
Sure looks strange to me (Purple People?)

And then he went on his way, and then what do ya know
I saw him last night on a TV show
He was blowing it out, a'really knockin' em dead
Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head",Purple People Eater,2009

But not like you love your freedom

Help me I think, I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past

Or lying there not talking didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good

Help me I think I'm falling in love with you

Grew my hair long and broke all the rules
I'd sit and listen to my records all day

They said my friends were just an unruly mob
And I should get a haircut and get a real job

Clean your act up and don't be a slob
Get it together like your big brother Bob
Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job

I even tried that nine to five scene
I told myself that it was all a bad dream
I found a band and some good songs to play
And now I party all night, I sleep all day

I met this chick she was my number one fan
She took me home to meet her mommy and dad
They took one look at me and said (oh my god)

So I told her softly and sincere

George Thorogood & the Destroyers,"Want to tell you a story
About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I'da lost my job

She said that don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady
I said you let me slide?
I'll have the rent for you in a month
Next I don't know

So said let me slide it on
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice

Loh' she was lovy-dovy
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said
You got the rent money yet?

I said no, can't find no job
Therefore I ain't got no money
To pay the rent
She said I don't believe

You're tryin' to find no job
Said I seen you today you was standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post
I said but I'm tired,

I've been walkin' all day
She said that don't concern me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent

And out the door I went
So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said look man

I'm outdoors you know
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?
He said let me go and ask my wife
He come out of the house

I could see it in his face
I know that was no
He said I don't know man
Ah she kinda funny, you know

I said I know,
Everybody funny, now you funny too
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job,

I'm gonna pay the rent
She said yeah? I said oh yeah
And then she was so nice
Loh' she was lovy-dovy

So I go in my room,
Pack up my things and I go
I slip on out the back door
And down the streets I go

She'll be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it

I saw a guy in the corner, bummin' all alone
As I passed him by, I heard him holler out, ""hey""
I slowed down to see what he said, he said um

""By any chance, are you goin' my way?""
I said, ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""
Then he reached out in his pocket
And that was the moment I regret

""Well now boy, reach for the sky""
Y'all said, ""but I don't understand, sir""
""Don't you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand""

And then he said, ""you see this rock I got in my hand?
This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame
It shoots tombstone bullets and a ball and chain""
He said, ""I ain't tryin' to shake you up, but I just want you to know
If the cops start crowdin' me in
You gonna be the first to go
So you just drive on like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back on nothin'

And he said, ""when you get to that red light
I want y'all to jump back to your left and then switch back to your right""
He said, um, ""I want you to park in the alley
Ah ah, not that, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door""
That's what he told me

He said, ""keep your foot on the gas
And always be on guard
'Cause when I come runnin' out the liquor store with all that money""
He wanted me to mash on it real hard

He said, ""now don't you come outta there and try me a double-cross
Because it's murder when the heat's on""

""Well now boy, reach for the sky""
""Yeah,"" but I said, ""I don't understand, sir""
""Don't you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand""

Oh wee, while I was sittin' there just tremblin'
A spotlight hit me dead in the face
The cops pulled up behind me and said
""Move up a bit man, we wanna take your place""

And then the guy come runnin' out of the store with the money in his hand
He said, ""oh there you are""
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in a police car
As they put the handcuffs on him
I said, ""child, your crime must have outgrew him""
And they said, ""yeah, we gonna put him so far back in jail this time
That they gonna have to pump air into him""

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down then I went to bed

I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head
Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
The overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
In the hot joint takin' the pill
There walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill

You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes so my name's is Billy Lee

If you've got a warrant you better read it to me

I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail

They stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail
Early next morning 'round half past nine
I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
Said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court
Into the courtroom my trial began

Where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree

I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me
The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen

Back in New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin 
Made of earth and wood

Named Johnny B. Goode

To read or write so well
But he could rock n' roll 
Like a bat out of hell

In a gunny sack
He sit down by the tree
By the railroad track

Sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
They would stop and say
My that St. Louie boy can play
Go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go

You'll be the leader of a really cool band

Everything perfect,

With thoughts from the ghost
And I spent her life savings
Left no room for

And screaming aloud,

Are careful to hide her and sing much too loud

Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one

Loving one who loves you

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1953

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1953

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

George Wettling,"Now, before this modern idea had burst
About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.
J'ai besoin d'un bel animal
Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.

To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

And of course Prince Charming is the theme

It is seldom that a dream comes true

That he'll appear

And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

That when she kisses me I sure stay kissed
When my sugar walks down the street
The little birdies go tweet tweet tweet.

George Wright,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling,2002

I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

Broken homes that He has mended

Heaven's choir now assembled
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace""

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Et la bouche pleine de joyeux ramages

Filant sa quenouille, il vit Cendrillon
Il lui dit ""Bonjour, que Dieu te ménage
Je t'emmène à la chasse aux papillons""

Met sa robe neuve et ses bottillons
Et bras dessus bras dessous vers les frais bocages

Il ne savait pas que sous les ombrages
Se cachait l'amour et son aiguillon
Et qu'il transperçait les cœurs de leur âge
Les cœurs des chasseurs de papillons

Quand il se fit tendre, elle lui dit ""Je présage
Que c'est pas dans les plis de mon cotillon
Ni dans l'échancrure de mon corsage
Qu'on va à la chasse aux papillons""

Sur sa bouche en feu qui criait ""Sois sage!""

Et ce fut le plus charmant des remue-ménage
Qu'on ait vu de mémoire de papillon

Georges Brassens,"C'est à travers de larges grilles,
Que les femelles du canton,
Contemplaient un puissant gorille,
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on.
Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu de nommer ici...
Gare au gorille !...

Tout à coup la prison bien close
Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre, on n'sait pourquoi. Je suppose
Qu'on avait du la fermer mal.

Dit ""C'est aujourd'hui que j'le perds !""
Il parlait de son pucelage,
Vous aviez deviné, j'espère !
Gare au gorille !...

L'patron de la ménagerie
Criait, éperdu : ""Nom de nom !
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon !""
Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau,
Au lieu de profiter de la chance,
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux !
Gare au gorille !...

Celles là même qui, naguère,
Le couvaient d'un il décidé,
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées ;
D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte,
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte,
Bien des femmes vous le diront !
Gare au gorille !...

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut,
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut;
Voyant que toutes se dérobent,
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vieille et du magistrat !
Gare au gorille !...

""Bah ! soupirait la centenaire,
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer,
Ce serait extraordinaire,
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré !"" ;
Le juge pensait, impassible,
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon,
C'est complètement impossible...""
La suite lui prouva que non !
Gare au gorille !...

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être,
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre,
Lequel choisirait-il des deux ?
Qu'une alternative pareille,
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie,
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vieille
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix !
Gare au gorille !...

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix,
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit.
Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vieille,
Comme l'aurait fait n'importe qui,
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis !
Gare au gorille !...

La suite serait délectable,
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable,
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu ;
Car le juge, au moment suprême,
Criait : ""Maman !"", pleurait beaucoup,
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même,
Il avait fait trancher le cou.
Gare au gorille !...",Le Gorille [*],1956

Georges Brassens,"Quand je vais chez la fleuriste
Je n'achèt' que des lilas
Si ma chanson chante triste
C'est que l'amour n'est plus là

Comm' j'étais, en quelque sorte
Amoureux de ces fleurs-là
Je suis entré par la porte
Par la porte des Lilas

Des lilas, y'en avait guère
Des lilas, y'en avait pas
Z'étaient tous morts à la guerre
Passés de vie à trépas

J'suis tombé sur une belle
Qui fleurissait un peu là
J'ai voulu greffer sur elle
Mon amour pour les lilas

J'ai marqué d'une croix blanche
Le jour où l'on s'envola
Accrochés à une branche
Une branche de lilas

Pauvre amour, tiens bon la barre
Le temps va passer par là
Et le temps est un barbare
Dans le genre d'Attila

Aux cœurs où son cheval passe
L'amour ne repousse pas
Aux quatre coins de l'espace
Il fait le désert sous ses pas

Alors, nos amours sont mortes
Envolées dans l'au-delà
Laissant la clé sous la porte
Sous la porte des Lilas

La fauvette des dimanches
Cell' qui me donnait le la
S'est perchée sur d'autres branches
D'autres branches de lilas

Quand je vais chez la fleuriste
Je n'achèt' que des lilas
Si ma chanson chante triste
C'est que l'amour n'est plus là",Les Lilas,1957
Georges Brassens,"J'ai des tombeaux en abondance
des sépultur's à discrétion
dans tout cim'tièr' d'quelque importance
j'ai ma petite concession
de l'humble tertre au mausolée
avec toujours quelqu'un dedans
j'ai des p'tit's boss's plein les allées
et je suis triste, cependant...
car je n'en ai pas, et ça m'agace
et ça défrise mon blason
au cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de ma maison
j'en possède au père-lachaise
a bagneux, à thiais, à pantin
et jusque, ne vous en déplaise
au fond du cimetièr' marin
a la vill' comme à la campagne
partout où l'on peut faire un trou
j'ai mêm' des tombeaux en espagne
qu'on me jalouse peu ou prou...
mais j'n'en ai pas la moindre trace
le plus humble petit soupçon
au cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de ma maison
le jour des morts, je cours, je vole
je vais infatigablement
de nécropole en nécropole
de pierr' tombale en monument
on m'entrevoit sous un' couronne
d'immortelles à champerret
un peu plus tard, c'est à charonne
qu'on m'aperçoit sous un cyprès...
mais, seul, un fourbe aura l'audace
de dir' : j'l'ai vu à l'horizon
du cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de sa maison
devant l'château d'ma grand-tante
la marquise de carabas
ma saint' famille languit d'attente
mourra-t-ell', mourra-t-elle pas ?
l'un veut son or, l'autre veut ses meubles
qui ses bijoux, qui ses bib'lots
qui ses forêts, qui ses immeubles
qui ses tapis, qui ses tableaux...
moi je n'implore qu'une grâce
c'est qu'ell' pass' la morte-saison
au cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de ma maison
ainsi chantait, la mort dans l'âme
un jeune homm' de bonne tenue
en train de ranimer la flamme
du soldat qui lui était connu
or, il advint qu'le ciel eut marr' de
l'entendre parler d'ses caveaux
et dieu fit signe à la camarde
de l'expédier rue froidevaux...

funeste erreur de livraison
menèr'nt sa dépouille à montmartre
de l'autr' côté de sa maison",La Ballade des Cimetières,1961
Georges Brassens,"Dans les comptes d'apothicaire
Vingt ans, c'est un' somm' de bonheur
Mes vingt ans sont morts à la guerre
De l'autr' côté du champ d'honneur
Si j'connus un temps de chien, certes
C'est bien le temps de mes vingt ans
Cependant, je pleure sa perte
Il est mort, c'était le bon temps

Il est toujours joli, le temps passé
Un' fois qu'ils ont cassé leur pipe
On pardonne à tous ceux qui nous ont offensés
Les morts sont tous des braves types

Dans ta petit' mémoire de lièvre
Bécassine, il t'est souvenu
De notre amour du coin des lèvres
Amour nul et non avenu
Amour d'un sou qui n'allait, certes
Guèr' plus loin que le bout d'son lit
Cependant, nous pleurons sa perte
Il est mort, il est embelli

Il est toujours joli, le temps passé
Un' fois qu'ils ont cassé leur pipe

Pour conduire au royaum' des ombres

La terr' n'a jamais produit, certes
De canaille plus consommée
Cependant, nous pleurons sa perte

Georges Brassens,"Il pleuvait fort sur la grand-route
Elle cheminait sans parapluie
J'en avais un, volé, sans doute
Le matin même à un ami
Courant alors à sa rescousse
Je lui propose un peu d'abri
En séchant l'eau de sa frimousse
D'un air très doux, elle m'a dit ""oui""

Un petit coin de parapluie
Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange
Un petit coin de paradis
Contre un coin de parapluie
Je ne perdais pas au change, pardi

Chemin faisant, que ce fut tendre
D'ouïr à deux le chant joli
Que l'eau du ciel faisait entendre
Sur le toit de mon parapluie
J'aurais voulu, comme au déluge
Voir sans arrêt tomber la pluie
Pour la garder, sous mon refuge
Quarante jours, quarante nuits

Un petit coin de parapluie
Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange
Un petit coin de paradis
Contre un coin de parapluie
Je ne perdais pas au change, pardi

Mais bêtement, même en orage
Les routes vont vers des pays
Bientôt le sien fit un barrage
A l'horizon de ma folie
Il a fallu qu'elle me quitte
Après m'avoir dit grand merci
Et je l'ai vue toute petite
Partir gaiement vers mon oubli

Un petit coin de parapluie
Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange

Contre un coin de parapluie

Georges Brassens,"Jadis, au lieu du jardin que voici,
C’était la zone et tout ce qui s'ensuit,
Des masures des taudis insolites,
Des ruines pas romaines pour un sou.
Quant à la faune habitant la dessous
C’était la fine fleur c’était l'élite.

La fine fleur, l'élite du pavé.
Des besogneux des gueux des réprouvés,
Des mendiants rivalisant de tares,
Des chevaux de retour des propres à rien,
Ainsi qu'un croque-note, un musicien,
Une épave accrochée à sa guitare.

Adoptée par ce beau monde attendri,
Une petite fée avait fleuri
Au milieu de toute cette bassesse.
Comme on l'avait trouvée près du ruisseau,
Abandonnée en un somptueux berceau,
A tout hasard on l'appelait ""princesse"".

Or, un soir, Dieu du ciel, protégez nous!
La voila qui monte sur les genoux
Du croque-note et doucement soupire,
En rougissant quand même un petit peu
""C'est toi que j'aime et si tu veux tu peux
M'embrasser sur la bouche et même pire""

""Tout beau, princesse arrête un peu ton tir,
J'ai pas tellement l'étoffe du satyre,
Tu a treize ans,j'en ai trente qui sonnent,
Grosse différence et je ne suis pas chaud
Pour tâter d'la paille humide du cachot
Mais croque-not',j'dirais rien à personne""

N'insiste pas fit-il d'un ton railleur,
D'abord tu n'es pas mon genre et d'ailleurs
Mon cœur est déjà pris par une grande""
Alors princesse est partie en courant,
Alors princesse est partie en pleurant,
Chagrine qu'on ait boudé son offrande.

Y a pas eu détournement de mineure,
Le croque-note au matin, de bonne heure,
A l'anglaise a filé dans la charrette
Des chiffonniers en grattant sa guitare.
Passant par là quelques vingt ans plus tard,
Il a le sentiment qu'il le regrette.",La Princesse et le Croque-Notes,1961
Georges Brassens,"Je serai triste comme un saule
Quand le Dieu qui partout me suit
Me dira, la main sur l'épaule
""Va-t'en voir là-haut si j'y suis""
Alors, du ciel et de la terre
Il me faudra faire mon deuil
Est-il encore debout le chêne
Ou le sapin de mon cercueil

S'il faut aller au cimetière
J'prendrai le chemin le plus long
J'ferai la tombe buissonnière
Je quitterai la vie à reculons
Tant pis si les croque-morts me grondent
Tant pis s'ils me croient fou à lier
Je veux partir pour l'autre monde
Par le chemin des écoliers

Avant d'aller conter fleurette
Aux belles âmes des damnées
Je rêve d'encore une amourette
Je rêve d'encore m'enjuponner
Encore un' fois dire: ""Je t'aime""
Encore un' fois perdre le nord
En effeuillant le chrysanthème
Qui est la marguerite des morts

Dieu veuille que ma veuve s'alarme
En enterrant son compagnon
Et que pour lui faire verser des larmes
Il n'y ait pas besoin d'oignon
Qu'elle prenne en secondes noces
Un époux de mon acabit
Il pourra profiter de mes bottes
Et de mes pantoufles et de mes habits

Qu'il boive mon vin, qu'il aime ma femme
Qu'il fume ma pipe et mon tabac
Mais que jamais - mort de mon âme
Jamais il ne fouette mes chats
Quoique je n'aie pas un atome
Une ombre de méchanceté
S'il fouette mes chats, y a un fantôme
Qui viendra le persécuter

Ici-gît une feuille morte
Ici finit mon testament
On a marque dessus ma porte
""Fermé pour cause d'enterrement""
J'ai quitté la vie sans rancune
J'aurai plus jamais mal aux dents
Me v'là dans la fosse commune
La fosse commune du temps",Letestament,1961
Georges Brassens,"J'ai plaqué mon chêne
Comme un saligaud
Mon copain le chêne
Mon alter ego
On était du même bois
Un peu rustique, un peu brut
Dont on fait n'importe quoi
Sauf naturellement les flûtes
J'ai maintenant des frênes
Des arbres de judée
Tous de bonne graine
De haute futaie
Mais toi, tu manques à l'appel
Ma vieille branche de campagne
Mon seul arbre de Noël
Mon mât de cocagne

Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû
M'éloigner de mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû

Je suis un pauvre type
J'aurais plus de joie
J'ai jeté ma pipe
Ma vieille pipe en bois
Qu'avait fumé sans s'fâcher
Sans jamais m'brûlé la lippe
L'tabac d'la vache enragée
Dans sa bonne vieille tête de pipe
J'ai des pipes d'écume
Ornées de fleurons
De ces pipes qu'on fume
En levant le front
Mais j'retrouverai plus ma foi
Dans mon cœur ni sur ma lippe
Le goût d'ma vieille pipe en bois
Sacré nom d'une pipe

J'aurais jamais dû
M'éloigner de mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû
Le quitter des yeux

Le surnom d'infâme
Me va comme un gant
D'avecques ma femme
J'ai foutu le camp
Parce que depuis tant d'années
C'était pas une sinécure
De lui voir tout l'temps le nez
Au milieu de la figure
Je bas la campagne
Pour dénicher la
Nouvelle compagne
Valant celles-là
Qui, bien sûr, laissait beaucoup
Trop de pierres dans les lentilles
Mais se pendait à mon cou
Quand j'perdais mes billes

Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû
M'éloigner d' mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû
Le quitter des yeux

J'avais une mansarde
Pour tout logement
Avec des lézardes
Sur le firmament
Je l'savais par cœur depuis
Et pour un baiser la course
J'emmenais mes belles de nuits
Faire un tour sur la grande ourse
J'habite plus d'une mansarde
Il peut désormais
Tomber des hall'bardes
Je m'en bats l'œil mais
Mais si quelqu'un monte aux cieux
Moins que moi j'y paie des prunes
Y a cent sept ans qui dit mieux
Que j'ai pas vu la lune

Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû
M'éloigner de mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû

Georges Brassens,"Les copains affligés, les copines en pleurs
La boîte à dominos enfouie sous les fleurs
Tout le monde équipé de sa tenue de deuil
La farce était bien bonne et valait le coup d'œil

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
L'enterrement paraissait officiel
Bravo!

Le mort ne chantait pas : ""Ah ! c'qu'on s'emmerde ici !""
Il prenait son trépas à cœur, cette fois-ci
Et les bonshomm's chargés de la levée du corps
Ne chantaient pas non plus ""Saint-Eloi bande encor !""

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le macchabée semblait tout à fait mort

Les commères choisies pour les cordons du poêle

Un de ces goupillons en forme de phallus
Et quand il y alla de ses de profondis
L'enfant de chœur répliqua pas morpionibus

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le curé venait pas de Camaret
Bravo 

On descendit la bière et je fus bien déçu
La blague maintenant frisait le mauvais goût
Car le mort se laissa jeter la terr' dessus
Sans lever le couvercle en s'écriant ""Coucou !

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le cercueil n'était pas à double fond
Bravo !

Quand tout fut consommé, je leur ai dit : ""Messieurs
Allons faire à présent la tournée des boxons !""
Mais ils m'ont regardé avec de pauvres yeux
Puis ils m'ont embrassé d'une étrange façon

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Leur compassion semblait venir du cœur
Bravo !

Quand je suis ressorti de ce champ de navets
L'ombre de l'ici-gît pas à pas me suivait
Une petite croix de trois fois rien du tout
Faisant, à elle seul', de l'ombre un peu partout

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Les revenants s'en mêlaient à leur tour
Bravo !

J'ai compris ma méprise un petit peu plus tard
Quand, allumant ma pipe avec le faire-part
J'm'aperçus que mon nom, comm' celui d'un bourgeois
Occupait sur la liste une place de choix

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
J'étais le plus proch' parent du défunt
Bravo !

Adieu ! les faux tibias, les crânes de carton

Georges Brassens,"Je vivais à l'écart de la place publique,
Serein, contemplatif, ténébreux, bucolique...
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloir',
Sur mon brin de laurier je dormais comme un loir.
Les gens de bon conseil ont su me fair' comprendre
Qu'à l'homme de la ru' j'avais des compt's à rendre
Et que, sous peine de choir dans un oubli complet,
J' devais mettre au grand jour tous mes petits secrets.

{Refrain:}
Trompettes
De la Renommée,
Vous êtes
Bien mal embouchées !

Manquant à la pudeur la plus élémentaire,
Dois-je, pour les besoins d' la caus' publicitaire,
Divulguer avec qui, et dans quell' position
Je plonge dans le stupre et la fornication ?
Si je publi' des noms, combien de Pénélopes
Passeront illico pour de fieffé's salopes,
Combien de bons amis me r'gard'ront de travers,
Combien je recevrai de coups de revolver !

A toute exhibition, ma nature est rétive,
Souffrant d'un' modesti' quasiment maladive,
Je ne fais voir mes organes procréateurs
A personne, excepté mes femm's et mes docteurs.
Dois-je, pour défrayer la chroniqu' des scandales,
Battre l' tambour avec mes parti's génitales,
Dois-je les arborer plus ostensiblement,
Comme un enfant de ch?ur porte un saint sacrement ?

Une femme du monde, et qui souvent me laisse
Fair' mes quat' voluptés dans ses quartiers d' noblesse,
M'a sournois'ment passé, sur son divan de soi',
Des parasit's du plus bas étage qui soit...
Sous prétexte de bruit, sous couleur de réclame,
Ai-j' le droit de ternir l'honneur de cette dame
En criant sur les toits, et sur l'air des lampions :
"" Madame la marquis' m'a foutu des morpions ! "" ?

Le ciel en soit loué, je vis en bonne entente
Avec le Pèr' Duval, la calotte chantante,
Lui, le catéchumène, et moi, l'énergumèn',
Il me laisse dire merd', je lui laiss' dire amen,
En accord avec lui, dois-je écrir' dans la presse
Qu'un soir je l'ai surpris aux genoux d' ma maîtresse,
Chantant la mélopé' d'une voix qui susurre,
Tandis qu'ell' lui cherchait des poux dans la tonsure ?

Avec qui, ventrebleu ! faut-il que je couche
Pour fair' parler un peu la déesse aux cent bouches ?
Faut-il qu'un' femme célèbre, une étoile, une star,
Vienn' prendre entre mes bras la plac' de ma guitar' ?
Pour exciter le peuple et les folliculaires,
Qui'est-c' qui veut me prêter sa croupe populaire,
Qui'est-c' qui veut m' laisser faire, in naturalibus,
Un p'tit peu d'alpinism' sur son mont de Vénus ?

Sonneraient-ell's plus fort, ces divines trompettes,
Si, comm' tout un chacun, j'étais un peu tapette,
Si je me déhanchais comme une demoiselle
Et prenais tout à coup des allur's de gazelle ?
Mais je ne sache pas qu'ça profite à ces drôles
De jouer le jeu d' l'amour en inversant les rôles,
Qu'ça confère à ma gloire un' onc' de plus-valu',
Le crim' pédérastique, aujourd'hui, ne pai' plus.

Après c'tour d'horizon des mille et un' recettes
Qui vous val'nt à coup sûr les honneurs des gazettes,
J'aime mieux m'en tenir à ma premièr' façon
Et me gratter le ventre en chantant des chansons.
Si le public en veut, je les sors dare-dare,
S'il n'en veut pas je les remets dans ma guitare.

Georges Brassens,"C'est vrai qu'ils sont plaisants tous ces petits villages
Tous ces bourgs, ces hameaux, ces lieux-dits, ces cités
Avec leurs châteaux forts, leurs églises, leurs plages

Et c'est être habités par des gens qui regardent
Le reste avec mépris du haut de leurs remparts

Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

Ou du diable vauvert ou de Zanzibar
Ou même de Montcuq il s'en flattent mazette

Enfouissent la tête on trouve pas plus fin
Quand à l'air qu'ils emploient pour gonfler leurs baudruches
Leurs bulles de savon c'est du souffle divin
Et petit à petit les voilà qui se montent
Le cou jusqu'à penser que le crottin fait par
Les chevaux même en bois rend jaloux tout le monde
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

C'est pas un lieu commun celui de leur connaissance
Ils plaignent de tout coeur les malchanceux
Les petits maladroits qui n'eurent pas la présence
La présence d'esprit de voir le jour chez eux
Quand sonne le tocsin sur leur bonheur précaire
Contre les étrangers tous plus ou moins barbares
Ils sortent de leur trou pour mourir à la guerre
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

Mon Dieu qu'il ferait bon sur la terre des hommes
Si on y rencontrait cette race incongrue
Cette race importune et qui partout foisonne
La race des gens du terroir des gens du cru
Que la vie serait belle en toutes circonstances
Si vous n'aviez tiré du néant tous ces jobards
Preuve peut-être bien de votre inexistence

Georges Brassens,"Mourir pour des idées
L'idée est excellente
Moi j'ai failli mourir de ne l'avoir pas eue
Car tous ceux qui l'avaient
Multitude accablante
En hurlant à la mort me sont tombés dessus

Ils ont su me convaincre
Et ma muse insolente
Abjurant ses erreurs se rallie à leur foi
Avec un soupçon de déserve toutefois
Mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente

Jugeant qu'il n'y a pas
Péril en la demeure
Allons vers l'autre monde en flânant en chemin
Car, à forcer l'allure
Il arrive qu'on meure
Pour des idées n'ayant plus cours le lendemain

Or, s'il est une chose
Amère, désolante
En rendant l'âme à Dieu, c'est bien de constater
Qu'on a fait fausse route, qu'on s'est trompé d'idée
Mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente

Les Saint Jean bouche d'or
Qui prêchent le martyre
Le plus souvent d'ailleurs, s'attardent ici-bas
Mourir pour des idées
C'est le cas de le dire
C'est leur raison de vivre, ils ne s'en privent pas 

Dans presque tous les camps
On en voit qui supplantent
Bientôt Mathusalem dans la longévité
J'en conclus qu'ils doivent se dire
En aparté, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Des idées réclamant
Le fameux sacrifice 
Les sectes de tout poil en offrent des séquelles 
Et la question se pose
Aux victimes novices 
Mourir pour des idées, c'est bien beau mais lesquelles? 

Et comme toutes sont entre elles ressemblantes 
Quand il les voit venir
Avec leur gros drapeau 
Le sage, en hésitant
Tourne autour du tombeau, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Encore s'il suffisait
De quelques hécatombes 
Pour qu'enfin tout changeât, qu'enfin tout s'arrangeât 
Depuis tant de ""grands soirs"" que tant de têtes tombent 
Au paradis sur terre, on y serait déjà 

Mais l'âge d'or sans cesse
Est remis aux calendes 
Les dieux ont toujours soif, n'en ont jamais assez 
Et c'est la mort, la mort
Toujours recommencée, mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente 

Ô vous, les boutefeuxà
Ô vous les bons apôtres 
Mourez donc les premiers, nous vous cédons le pas 
Mais de grâce, morbleu!
Laissez vivre les autres! 
La vie est à peu près leur seul luxe ici-bas 

Car, enfin, la Camarde
Est assez vigilante 
Elle n'a pas besoin qu'on lui tienne la faux 
Plus de danse macabre

Georges Brassens,"Au village, sans prétention
J'ai mauvaise réputation
Qu'je m'démène ou qu'je reste coi

Mais les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux

Sauf les muets, ça va de soi

Le jour du Quatorze Juillet
Je reste dans mon lit douillet

Cela ne me regarde pas
Je ne fais pourtant de tort à personne

Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux

Sauf les manchots, ça va de soi

Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux
Poursuivi par un cul-terreux
J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire
Le cul-terreux se r'trouve par terre
Je ne fait pourtant de tort à personne
En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes

Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que

Pas besoin d'être Jérémie
Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis
S'ils trouv'nt une corde à leur goût
Ils me la passeront au cou

Georges Brassens,"Il avait nom corne d'Aurochs, au gué, au gué
Tout l'monde peut pas s'appeler Durand, au gué, au gué

En le regardant avec un œil de poète
On aurait pu croire à son frontal de prophète
Qu'il avait les grandes eaux de Versailles dans la tête
Corne d'Aurochs

Mais que le bon dieu lui pardonne, au gué, au gué
C'étaient celles du robinet, au gué, au gué

On aurait pu croire en l'voyant penché sur l'onde
Qu'il se plongeait dans des méditations profondes
Sur l'aspect fugitif des choses de se monde
Corne d'Aurochs

C'étaient hélas pour s'assurer, au gué, au gué
Que le vent n'l'avait pas décoiffé, au gué, au gué

Il proclamait à son de trompe à tous les carrefours
""Il n'y a qu'les imbéciles qui sachent bien faire l'amour
La virtuosité c'est une affaire de balourds!""
Corne d'Aurochs

Il potassait à la chandelle, au gué, au gué
Des traités de maintien sexuel, au gué, au gué
Et sur les femmes nues des musées, au gué, au gué
Faisait l'brouillon de ses baisers, au gué, au gué

Et bientôt petit à petit, au gué, au gué
On a tout su, tout su de lui, au gué, au gué

On a su qu'il était enfant de la Patrie
Qu'il était incapable de risquer sa vie
Pour cueillir un myosotis à une fille
Corne d'Aurochs

Qu'il avait un petit cousin, au gué, au gué
Haut placé chez les argousins, au gué, au gué
Et que les jours de pénurie, au gué, au gué
Il prenait ses repas chez lui, au gué, au gué

C'est même en revenant d'chez cet antipathique
Qu'il tomba victime d'une indigestion critique
Et refusa l'secours de la thérapeutique
Corne d'Aurochs

Parce que c'était un Allemand, au gué, au gué
Qu'on devait le médicament, au gué, au gué

Il rendit comme il put son âme machinale
Et sa vie n'ayant pas été originale
L'Etat lui fit des funérailles nationales

Georges Brassens,"Dieu sait que je n'ai pas le fond méchant
Je ne souhaite jamais la mort des gens

Je crèverais de faim sur mon talus

À gagner mon pain sur le dos des morts

Mais ça me tracasse et d'ailleurs
Je les enterre à contrecœur
Je suis un pauvre fossoyeur
Et plus je lâcherai bride à mon émoi
Et plus les copains s'amusent de moi
Ils me disent ""mon vieux, par moments
T'as une figure d'enterrement""

Georges Brassens,"Au marché de Brive-la-Gaillarde
A propos de bottes d'oignons
Quelques douzaines de gaillardes
Se crêpaient un jour le chignon
A pied, à cheval, en voiture
Les gendarmes mal inspirés
Vinrent pour tenter l'aventure
D'interrompre l'échauffourée

Or, sous tous les cieux sans vergogne
C'est un usage bien établi
Dès qu'il s'agit de rosser les cognes
Tout le monde se réconcilie
Ces furies perdant tout' mesure
Se ruèrent sur les guignols
Et donnèrent je vous l'assure
Un spectacle assez croquignol

En voyant ces braves pandores
Être à deux doigts de succomber
Moi, je bichais car je les adore
Sous la forme de macchabées
De la mansarde où je réside
J'exitais les farouches bras
Des mégères gendarmicides
En criant ""Hip, hip, hip, hourra!""

Frénétique l'un' d'elles attache
Le vieux maréchal des logis
Et lui fait crier ""Mort aux vaches,
Mort aux lois, vive l'anarchie!""
Une autre fourre avec rudesse
Le crâne d'un de ses lourdauds
Entre ses gigantesques fesses
Qu'elle serre comme un étau

La plus grasse de ses femelles
Ouvrant son corsage dilaté
Matraque à grand coup de mamelles
Ceux qui passent à sa portée
Ils tombent, tombent, tombent, tombent
Et selon les avis compétents
Il paraît que cette hécatombe
Fut la plus belle de tous les temps

Jugeant enfin que leurs victimes
Avaient eu leur content de gnons
Ces furies comme outrage ultime
En retournant à leurs oignons
Ces furies à peine si j'ose

Par bonheur ils n'en avait pas

Georges Brassens,"Ci-gît au fond de mon cœur une histoire ancienne
Un fantôme, un souvenir d'une que j'aimais
Le temps, à grands coups de faux, peut faire des siennes
Mon bel amour dure encore, et c'est à jamais

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En trouvant Margot
Princesse vêtue de laine
Déesse en sabots
Si les fleurs, le long des routes
S'mettaient à marcher
C'est à la Margot, sans doute
Qu'elles feraient songer

Tu es le portrait!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
C'était un peu vrai

Qu'il me pardonne ou non
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine

La mignonne allait aux vêpres
Se mettre à genoux
Alors j'ai mordu ses lèvres
Pour savoir leur goût
Elle m'a dit, d'un ton sévère
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire
Les filles, c'est comme ça
J'lui ai dit: ""Par la Madone
Reste auprès de moi!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
Mais chacun pour soi

Qu'il me pardonne ou non
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine

C'était une fille sage
A ""bouche, que veux-tu?""

Les fruits défendus
Elle m'a dit d'un ton sévère
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire

Et ta vertu ne pesait pas trop lourd

Tu as promené, tu as promené le feu de tes vingt ans

Comme il n'restait plus rien dans le garde-manger

Pour entendre une histoire encor
Approchez: je vous dirai celle
De doña Padilla del Flor
Elle était d'Alanje, où s'entassent
Les collines et les halliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il est des filles à Grenade
Il en est à Séville aussi
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade
A l'amour demandent merci
Il en est que parfois embrassent
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla
Car jamais prunelle espagnole
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent
Les filles sous les peupliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Elle prit le voile à Tolède
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent
Les soudards et les écoliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée
Amour en son cœur s'installa
Un fier brigand de la contrée
Vint alors et dit: ""Me voilà!""
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent
En audace les chevaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il était laid: les traits austères
La main plus rude que le gant
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères
Et la nonne aima le brigand
On voit des biches qui remplacent
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

La nonne osa, dit la chronique
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or quand, dans la nef descendue
La nonne appela le bandit
Au lieu de la voix attendue
C'est la foudre qui répondit
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent
Les amants par Satan liés
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Cette histoire de la novice
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut
Qu'afin de préserver du vice
Les vierges qui font leur salut
Les prieurs la racontassent
Dans tous les couvents réguliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Georges Brassens,"Voir le nombril de la femme d'un flic
N'est certainement pas un spectacle
Qui, du point de vue de l'esthétique

Brûlant de contempler le nombril
De la femme d'un agent de police

""Je me fais vieux, gémissait-il
Et, durant le cours de ma vie

Des nombrils de femmes de gendarmes

Et moi, je n'ai même pas vu le nombril
De la femme d'un agent de police""

Ainsi gémissait en public
Cet honnête homme vénérable
Quand la légitime d'un flic
Tendant son nombril secourable
Lui dit ""je m'en vais mettre fin

Par les effets de sa hantise
Et comme il atteignait le but

Georges Brassens,"Il vivait en dehors des chemins forestiers
Ce n'était nullement un arbre de métier
Il n'avait jamais vu l'ombre d'un bûcheron
Ce grand chêne fier sur son tronc

Il eût connu des jours filés d'or et de soie
Sans ses proches voisins, les pires gens qui soient 
Des roseaux mal pensant, pas même des bambous
S'amusant à le mettre à bout

Du matin jusqu'au soir ces petit rejetons
Tout juste cann' à pêch', à peine mirlitons
Lui tournant tout autour chantaient, in extenso
L'histoire du chêne et du roseau

Et, bien qu'il fût en bois, les chênes, c'est courant
La fable ne le laissait pas indifférent
Il advint que lassé d'être en but aux lazzi
Il se résolu à l'exi(l)

A grand-peine il sortit ses grands pieds de son trou
Et partit sans se retourner ni peu ni prou
Mais, moi qui l'ai connu, je sais qu'il en souffrit
De quitter l'ingrate patrie

A l'orée des forêts, le chêne ténébreux
A lié connaissance avec deux amoureux
Grand chêne laisse-nous sur toi graver nos noms
Le grand chêne n'as pas dit non

Quand ils eur'nt épuisé leur grand sac de baisers
Quand, de tant s'embrasser, leurs becs furent usés
Ils ouïrent alors, en retenant des pleurs
Le chêne contant ses malheurs

Grand chên', viens chez nous, tu trouveras la paix
Nos roseaux savent vivre et n'ont aucun toupet
Tu feras dans nos murs un aimable séjour
Arrosé quatre fois par jour

Cela dit, tous les trois se mettent en chemin
Chaque amoureux tenant une racine en main
Comme il semblait content ! Comme il semblait heureux 
Le chêne entre ses amoureux

Au pied de leur chaumière, ils le firent planter
Ce fut alors qu'il commença de déchanter
Car, en fait d'arrosage, il n'eut rien que la pluie
Des chiens levant la patt' sur lui

On a pris tous ses glands pour nourrir les cochons
Avec sa belle écorce on a fait des bouchons
Chaque fois qu'un arrêt de mort était rendu
C'est lui qui héritait du pendu

Puis ces mauvaises gens, vandales accomplis
Le coupèrent en quatre et s'en firent un lit
Et l'horrible mégère ayant des tas d'amants
Il vieillit prématurément

Un triste jour, enfin, ce couple sans aveu
Le passa par la hache et le mit dans le feu
Comme du bois de caisse, amère destinée
Il périt dans la cheminée

Le curé de chez nous, petit saint besogneux
Doute que sa fumée s'élève jusqu'à Dieu

L'herbe aux pendus qui revigore
En bénissant avec les pieds
Les ribaudes apitoyées

Et de mélancolie
N'as tu jamais en rêve
Au ciel d'un autre lit
Compté de nouvelles étoiles
Compté de nouvelles étoiles...

N'as-tu jamais encore
Appelé de tes vœux
L'amourette qui passe
Qui vous prend aux cheveux
Qui vous compte des bagatelles
Qui met la marguerite
Au jardin potager
La pomme défendue
Aux branches du verger
Et le désordre à vos dentelles
Et le désordre à vos dentelles...

N'as-tu jamais souhaité
De revoir en chemin
Cet ange, ce démon
Qui son arc à la main
Décoche des flèches malignes
Qui rend leur chair de femme
Aux plus froides statues
Les bascul' de leur socle
Bouscule leur vertu
Arrache leur feuille de vigne
Arrache leur feuille de vigne...

N'aie crainte que le ciel
Ne t'en tienne rigueur
Il n'y a vraiment pas là
De quoi fouetter un cœur
Qui bat la campagne et galope
C'est la faute commune

C'est la face cachée

Et la rançon de Pénélope
Et la rançon de Pénélope...",Pénélope,1996

Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

J'croyais tenir l'amour au bout de mon harpon

Mais tout est consommé : hier soir, au coin d'un bois
J'ai surpris ma maîtresse avec son mari, pouah
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

Trouverais-je les noms, trouverais-je les mots
Pour noter d'infamie cet enfant de chameau
Qu'a choisi son époux pour tromper son amant
Qu'a conduit l'adultère à son point culminant
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

Où donc avais-j'les yeux ? Quoi donc avais-j' dedans ?
Pour pas m'être aperçu depuis un certain temps
Que, quand ell' m'embrassait, ell' semblait moins goulue
Et faisait des enfants qui n'me ressemblaient plus
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

Et pour bien m'enfoncer la corne dans le cœur
Par un raffinement satanique, moqueur
La perfide, à voix haute, a dit à mon endroit
"" Le plus cornard des deux n'est point celui qu'on croit ""
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

J'ai surpris les Dupont, ce couple de marauds
En train d'recommencer leur hymen à zéro

En train d'intervertir l'ordre de ses cocus
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !",La Traîtresse,1996
Georges Brassens,"Sur ses larges bras étendus,
La forêt où s'éveille Flore,
A des chapelets de pendus
Que le matin caresse et dore.
Ce bois sombre, où le chêne arbore
Des grappes de fruits inouïs
Même chez le Turc et le More,
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Tous ces pauvres gens morfondus,
Roulant des pensers qu'on ignore,
Dans des tourbillons éperdus
Voltigent, palpitants encore.
Le soleil levant les dévore.
Regardez-les, cieux éblouis,
Danser dans les feux de l'aurore.
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Ces pendus, du diable entendus,
Appellent des pendus encore.
Tandis qu'aux cieux, d'azur tendus,
Où semble luire un météore,
La rosée en l'air s'évapore,
Un essaim d'oiseaux réjouis
Par-dessus leur tête picore.

Georges Brassens,"À peine sortis du berceau
Nous sommes allés faire un saut
Au boulevard du temps qui passe
En scandant notre ""ça ira""
Contre les vieux, les mous, les gras
Confinés dans leurs idées basses
On nous a vus, c'était hier
Qui descendions, jeunes et fiers
Dans une folle sarabande
En allumant des feux de joie
En alarmant les gros bourgeois
En piétinant leurs plates-bandes
Jurant de tout remettre à neuf
De refaire '89
De reprendre un peu la Bastille
Nous avons embrassé, goulus
Leurs femmes qu'ils ne touchaient plus
Nous avons fécondé leurs filles
Dans la mare de leurs canard
Nous avons lancé, goguenards

Force pavés, quelle tempête
Nous n'avons rien laissé debout
Flanquant leurs credos, leurs tabous
Et leurs dieux, cul par-dessus tête
Quand sonna le ""cessez-le-feu""
L'un de nous perdait ses cheveux
Et l'autre avait les tempes grises
Nous avons constaté soudain
Que l'été de la Saint-Martin
N'est pas loin du temps des cerises
Alors, ralentissant le pas
On fit la route à la papa
Car, braillant contre les ancêtres
La troupe fraîche des cadets
Au carrefour nous attendait
Pour nous envoyer à Bicêtre
Tous ces gâteux, ces avachis
Ces pauvres sépulcres blanchis
Chancelant dans leur carapace
On les a vus, c'était hier
Qui descendaient jeunes et fiers

Quand vous ne nous les caressez
Pas, chéries, vous nous les cassez.
Oubliez-les, si fair' se peut,
Qu'ell's se reposent.
Quand vous nous les dorlotez pas,
Vous nous les passez à tabac.
Oubliez-les, si fair' se peut,
Qu'ell's se reposent un peu,
Qu'ell's se reposent.

Enamourée, ma femme est douce,
Mes amis vous le diront tous.
Après l'étreinte, en moins de deux
Ell' r'devient un bâton merdeux.

Dans l'alcôve, on est bien reçus
Par la voisine du dessus.
Un' fois son désir assouvi,
Ingrate, ell' nous les crucifie.

Quand ell' passe en revue les zouaves
Ma s?ur est câline et suave.
Dès que s'achève l'examen,
Gare à qui tombe sous sa main.

Si tout le monde en ma maison
Reste au lit plus que de raison,

Y a guère que là qu'on est tranquilles.

Plaise à Dieu qu'elle plaise aux copains. {2x}

Ancienne enfant d'Marie-salope
Mélanie, la bonne au curé,
Dedans ses trompes de Fallope,
S'introduit des cierges sacrés.
Des cierges de cire d'abeille
Plus onéreux, mais bien meilleurs, {2x}
Dame! la qualité se paye
A Saint-Sulpice, comme ailleurs. {2x}

Quand son bon maître lui dit : ""Est-ce
Trop vous demander Mélanie,
De n'user, par délicatesse,
Que de cierges non encore bénits ?""
Du tac au tac, elle réplique
Moi, je préfère qu'ils le soient, {2x}
Car je suis bonne catholique
Elle a raison, ça va de soi. {2x}

Elle vous emprunte un cierge à Pâques

Non, non, non, ne me dites pas que
C'est normal de tant le garder.

C'est le jour de la Chandeleur. {2x}

Souvent quand elle les abandonne,

Comme ell' remue, comme elle se cabre,
Comme elle fait des soubresauts, {2x}
En retournant au candélabre,
Ils sont souvent en p'tits morceaux. {2x}

Et comme elle n'est pas de glace,
Parfois quand elle les restitue
Et qu'on veut les remettre en place,
Ils sont complètement fondus.
Et comme en outre elle n'est pas franche,
Il arrive neuf fois sur dix {2x}

De nous employer à soustraire
Cette âme aux griffes de Satan. {2x}

Gros mangeur d'écclésiastiques,
Cet aveu me coûte beaucoup,
Mais ces hommes d'Eglise, hélas !
Ne sont pas tous des dégueulasses,
Témoin le curé de chez nous.

Quand la foule qui se déchaîne
Pendit un homme au bout d'un chêne
Sans forme aucune de remords,
Ce ratichon fit scandale
Et rugit à travers les stalles,
""Mort à toute peine de mort!""

Puis, on le vit, étrange rite,
Qui baptisait les marguerites
Avec l'eau de son bénitier
Et qui prodiguait les hosties,
Le pain bénit, l'Eucharistie,
Aux petits oiseaux du moutier.

Ensuite, il retroussa ses manches,
Prit son goupillon des dimanches
Et, plein d'une sainte colère,
Il partit comme à l'offensive
Dire une grand' messe exclusive
A celui qui dansait en l'air.

C'est à du gibier de potence
Qu'en cette triste circonstance
L'Hommage sacré fut rendu.

Suivi de son pin parasol,
S'il fuit sans mêm' toucher le sol
Le moindre effort comme la peste,

En rogne, on ne le voit jamais

Et quand il tombe amoureux fou
Y a pas de danger qu'il l'avoue
Les effusions, dame, il déteste.
Selon lui, mettre en plein soleil

C'était pas d'la litterature
N'en déplaise aux jeteurs de sort
Aux jeteurs de sort
Son capitaine et ses mat'lots
N'étaient pas des enfants d'salauds
Mais des amis franco de port
Des copains d'abord

C'étaient pas des amis de luxe
Des petits Castor et Pollux
Des gens de Sodome et Gomorrhe
Sodome et Gomorrhe
C'étaient pas des amis choisis
Par Montaigne et La Boetie
Sur le ventre ils se tapaient fort
Les copains d'abord

C'étaient pas des anges non plus
L'Évangile, ils l'avaient pas lu
Mais ils s'aimaient tout's voil's dehors
Tout's voil's dehors
Jean, Pierre, Paul et compagnie
C'était leur seule litanie
Leur Credo, leur Confiteor
Aux copains d'abord

Au moindre coup de Trafalgar
C'est l'amitié qui prenait l'quart
C'est elle qui leur montrait le nord
Leur montrait le nord
Et quand ils étaient en détresse
Qu'leurs bras lancaient des S.O.S.
On aurait dit les sémaphores
Les copains d'abord

Au rendez-vous des bons copains
Y avait pas souvent de lapins
Quand l'un d'entre eux manquait a bord
C'est qu'il était mort
Oui, mais jamais, au grand jamais
Son trou dans l'eau n'se refermait
Cent ans après, coquin de sort
Il manquait encore

Des bateaux j'en ai pris beaucoup
Mais le seul qu'ait tenu le coup
Qui n'ai jamais viré de bord
Mais viré de bord
Naviguait en père peinard
Sur la grand-mare des canards
Et s'app'lait les Copains d'abord

Georges Brassens,"J'ai pris la route de Dijon
Pour voir un peu la Marjolaine
La belle, digue digue don
Qui pleurait près de la fontaine
Mais elle avait changé de ton
Il lui fallait des ducatons
Dedans son bas de laine
Pour n'avoir plus de peine
Elle m'a dit : Tu viens, chéri ?
Et si tu me payes un bon prix
Aux anges je t'emmène
Digue digue don daine 
La Marjolain' pleurait surtout
Quand elle n'avait pas de sous
La Marjolain' de la chanson

J'ai passé le pont d'Avignon
Pour voir un peu les belles dames
Et les beaux messieurs tous en rond
Qui dansaient, dansaient, corps et âmes
Mais ils avaient changé de ton
Ils faisaient fi des rigodons
Menuets et pavanes
Tarentelles, sardanes
Et les bell's dam's m'ont dit ceci
Etranger, sauve-toi d'ici
Ou l'on donne l'alarme
Aux chiens et aux gendarmes 
Quelle mouch' les a donc piquées
Ces belles dam's si distinguées
Les belles dam's de la chanson

Je me suis fait fair' prisonnier
Dans les vieilles prisons de Nantes
Pour voir la fille du geôlier
Qui, paraît-il, est avenante
Mais elle avait changé de ton
Quand j'ai demandé: Que dit-on
Des affaires courantes
Dans la ville de Nantes
La mignonne m'a répondu
On dit que vous serez pendu
Aux matines sonnantes
Et j'en suis bien contente

Aux prisons de Nante' et d'ailleurs
La geôlière de la chanson
Avait de plus nobles façons

Voulant mener à bonne fin
Ma folle course vagabonde
Vers mes pénates je revins
Pour dormir auprès de ma blonde
Mais elle avait changé de ton
Avec elle, sous l'édredon
Il y avait du monde
Dormant près de ma blonde
J'ai pris le coup d'un air blagueur
Mais, en cachette, dans mon cur

Au temps où les faux culs sont la majorité
Gloire à celui qui dit toute la vérité

Votre dos perd son nom avec si bonne grâce
Qu'on ne peut s'empêcher de lui donner raison
Que ne suis-je, madame, un poète de race
Pour dire à sa louange un immortel blason

En le voyant passer, j'en eus la chair de poule
Enfin, je vins au monde et, depuis, je lui voue
Un culte véritable et, quand je perds aux boules
En embrassant Fanny, je ne pense qu'à vous

Pour obtenir, madame, un galbe de cet ordre
Vous devez torturer les gens de votre entour
Donner aux couturiers bien du fil à retordre
Et vous devez crever votre dame d'atour

C'est le duc de Bordeaux qui s'en va, tête basse
Car il ressemble au mien comme deux gouttes d'eau
S'il ressemblait au vôtre, on dirait, quand il passe
""C'est un joli garçon que le duc de Bordeaux!""

Ne faites aucun cas des jaloux qui professent
Que vous avez placé votre orgueil un peu bas
Que vous présumez trop, en somme de vos fesses

La brise a fait voler votre robe et qu'on vit
Ecrite dans un c?ur transpercé d'une flèche

Faisant la révérence aux souverains anglois
Vous êtes, patatras ! tombée assise à terre
La loi d'la pesanteur est dure, mais c'est la loi

A l'assaut des chefs-d'œuvre ils veulent tous courir
Mes ambitions à moi sont bien plus raisonnables

Georges Brassens,"Notre voisin l'ancêtre était un fier galant
Qui n'emmerdait personne avec sa barbe blanche
Et quand le bruit courut qu'ses jours étaient comptés
On s'en fut à l'hospice afin de l'assister

On avait apporté les guitars avec nous
Car, devant la musique, il tombait à genoux
Excepté toutefois les marches militaires
Qu'il écoutait en se tapant le cul par terre
Qu'il écoutait en se tapant le cul par terre

Émules de Django, disciples de Crolla
Toute la fine fleur des cordes était là
Pour offrir à l'ancêtre, en signe d'affection
En guis’ de viatique, une ultime audition
En guis’ de viatique, une ultime audition

Hélas! les carabins ne les ont pas reçus
Les guitars sont resté’s à la porte cochère
Et le dernier concert de l'ancêtre déçu
Ce fut un pot-pourri de cantiques, peuchère!

Quand nous serons ancêtres
Du côté de Bicêtre
Pas de musique d'orgue, oh non!
Pas de chants liturgiques
Pour qui aval' sa chique
Mais des guitars, crénom de nom!
Mais des guitars, crénom de nom!

On avait apporté quelques litres aussi
Car le bonhomme avait la fièvre de Bercy
Et les soirs de nouba, paroles de tavernier
A rouler sous la table il était le dernier
A rouler sous la table il était le dernier

Saumur, Entre-deux-mers, Beaujolais, Marsala
Toute la fine fleur de la vigne était là

Hélas! les carabins ne les ont pas reçus

Ce fut un grand verre d'eau bénite, peuchère!

Quand nous serons ancêtres
Du côté de Bicêtre
Ne nous faites pas boire, oh non!
De ces eaux minérales
Bénites ou lustrales
Mais du bon vin, crénom de nom!
Mais du bon vin, crénom de nom!

On avait emmené les belles du quartier
Car l'ancêtre courait la gueuse volontiers
De sa main toujours leste et digne cependant
Il troussait les jupons par n'importe quel temps
Il troussait les jupons par n'importe quel temps

Depuis Manon Lescaut jusques à Dalila

Georges Brassens,"Ô vie heureuse des bourgeois
Qu'avril bourgeonne
Ou que decembre gèle,
Ils sont fiers et contents

Ce pigeon est aimé,
Trois jours par sa pigeonne
Ça lui suffit il sait
Que l'amour n'a qu'un temps

Ce dindon a toujours
Béni sa destinée
Et quand vient le moment
De mourir il faut voir

Cette jeune oie en pleurs
C'est la que je suis née
Je meurs presd de ma mère
Et je fais mon devoir

Elle a fait son devoir
C'est a dire que Onques
Elle n'eut de souhait
Impossible elle n'eut

Aucun rêve de lune
Aucun désir de jonque
L'emportant sans rameurs
Sur un fleuve inconnu

Et tous sont ainsi faits
Vivre la même vie
Toujours pour ces gens là
Cela n'est point hideux

Ce canard n'a qu'un bec
Et n'eut jamais envie
Ou de n'en plus avoir
Ou bien d'en avoir deux

Ils n'ont aucun besoin
De baiser sur les lèvres
Et loin des songes vains
Loin des soucis cuisants

Possèdent pour tout c?ur
Un vicere sans fièvre
Un coucou régulier
Et garanti dix ans

Ô les gens bien heureux
Tout à coup dans l'espace
Si haut qu'ils semblent aller
Lentement en grand vol

En forme de triangle
Arrivent planent, et passent
Où vont ils? ... qui sont-ils ?
Comme ils sont loins du sol

Regardez les passer, eux
Ce sont les sauvages
Ils vont où leur desir
Le veut par dessus monts

Et bois, et mers, et vents
Et loin des esclavages
L'air qu'ils boivent
Ferait éclater vos poumons

Regardez les avant
D'atteindre sa chimère
Plus d'un l'aile rompue
Et du sang plein les yeux

Mourra. Ces pauvres gens
Ont aussi femme et mère
Et savent les aimer
Aussi bien que vous, mieux

Pour choyer cette femme
Et nourrir cette mère
Ils pouvaient devenir
Volailles comme vous

Mais ils sont avant tout
Des fils de la chimère
Des asoiffés d'azur
Des poètes des fous

monter aussi haut qu'eux

Georges Brassens,"Voilà les feuilles sans sève qui tombent sur le gazon
Voilà le vent qui s'élève et gémit dans le vallon
Voilà l'errante hirondelle qui rase du bout de l'aile
L'eau dormante des marais voilà l'enfant des chaumières
Qui glane sur les bruyères le bois tombé des forêts

C'est la saison où tout tombe aux coups redoublés des vents
Un vent qui vient de la tombe moissonne aussi les vivants
Ils tombent alors par mille comme la plume inutile
Que l'aigle abandonne aux  5a8 airs lorsque des plumes nouvelles
Viennent réchauffer ses ailes à l'approche des hivers

C'est alors que ma paupière vous vit palir et mourir
Tendres fruits qu'à la lumière dieu n'a pas laissé murir
Quoique jeune sur la terre je suis dejà solitaire
Parmi ceux de ma saison et quand je dis en moi-même
""où sont ceux que ton cœur aime?"" Je regarde le gazon

C'est un ami de l'enfance qu'aux jours sombres du malheur
Nous prêta la providence pour appuyer notre cœur
Il n'est plus, notre âme est veuve il nous suit dans notre épreuve
Et nous dit avec pitié, ""Ami si ton âme est pleine
De ta joie ou de ta peine qui portera la moitié?""

C'est une jeune fiancée qui, le front ceint du bandeau
N'emporta qu'une pensée de sa jeunesse au tombeau
Triste, hélas ! dans le ciel même pour revoir celui qu'elle aime
Elle revient sur ses pas et lui dit, ""Ma tombe est verte
Sur cette terre déserte qu'attends-tu? je n'y suis pas""

C'est l'ombre pâle d'un père qui mourut en nous nommant
C'est une sœur, c'est un frère qui nous devance un moment
Tous ceux enfin dont la vie un jour ou l'autre ravie, emport 548
E une part de nous murmurent sous la pierre
""Vous qui voyez la lumière de nous vous souvenez vous?""

Voilà les feuilles sans sève qui tombent sur le gazon
Voilà le vent qui s'élève et gémit dans le vallon
Voilà l'errante hirondelle qui rase du bout de l'aile
L'eau dormante des marais voilà l'enfant des chaumières
Qui glane sur les bruyères le bois tombé des forêts

",Pensees des Morts,1996
Georges Brassens,"Tous les cœurs se rallient à sa blanche cornette
Si le chrétien succombe à son charme insidieux
Le païen le plus sûr, l'athée le plus honnête
Se laisseraient aller parfois à croire en Dieu
Et les enfants de chœur font tinter leur sonnette

Il paraît que, dessous sa cornette fatale
Qu'elle arbore à la messe avec tant de rigueur
Cette petite sœur cache, c'est un scandale
Une queu' de cheval et des accroche-cœurs
Et les enfants de chœur s'agitent dans les stalles

Il paraît que, dessous son gros habit de bure
Elle porte coquettement des bas de soie
Festons, frivolités, fanfreluches, guipures
Enfin tout ce qu'il faut pour que le diable y soit
Et les enfants de chœur ont des pensées impures

Il paraît que le soir, en voici bien d'une autre!
A l'heure où ses consœurs sont sagement couchées
Ou débitent pieusement des patenôtres
Elle se déshabille devant sa psyché
Et les enfants de chœur ont la fièvre, les pauvres

Il paraît qu'à loisir elle se mire nue
De face, de profil, et même, hélas! de dos
Après avoir, sans gêne, accroché sa tenue
Aux branches de la croix comme au portemanteau
Chez les enfants de chœur le malin s'insinue

Il paraît que, levant au ciel un œil complice
Elle dit: ""Bravo, Seigneur, c'est du joli travail!""
Puis qu'elle ajoute avec encor plus de malice 
""La cambrure des reins, ça, c'est une trouvaille!""
Et les enfants de chœur souffrent un vrai supplice

Il paraît qu'à minuit, bonne mère, c'est pire 
On entend se mêler, dans d'étranges accords
La voix énamourée des anges qui soupirent
Et celle de la sœur criant ""Encor! Encor!""
Et les enfants de chœur, les malheureux, transpirent

Et monsieur le curé, que ces bruits turlupinent
Se dit avec raison que le brave Jésus
Avec sa tête, hélas! déjà chargée d'épines
N'a certes pas besoin d'autre chose dessus
Et les enfants de chœur, branlant du chef, opinent

Tout ça, c'est des faux bruits, des ragots, des sornettes
De basses calomnies par Satan répandues
Pas plus d'accroche-cœurs sous la blanche cornette
Que de queue de cheval, mais un crâne tondu
Et les enfants de chœur en font, une binette

Pas de troubles penchants dans ce cœur rigoriste
Sous cet austère habit pas de rubans suspects
On ne verra jamais la corne au front du Christ
Le veinard sur sa croix peut s'endormir en paix
Et les enfants de chœur se masturber, tout tristes",La Religieuse,1996
Georges Brassens,"Cette rose avait glissé de

Yeux pour voir hisser les couleurs

Et je repris ma route avec l'intention
De faire circuler la virile effusion
Car c'est une des pir's perversions qui soient
Qu' de garder une poigné' de main par-devers soi

Le premier m'a dit: ""Fous le camp !
J'aurais peur de salir mes gants.""
Le deuxième, d'un air dévot
Me donna cent sous, d'ailleurs faux

Si le troisième, ours mal léché
Dans ma main tendue a craché
Le quatrième, c'est plus méchant

Pour recouvrer tout son fourbi

Pas plus tôt descendu de sa noire calèche
Il nous a dit : ""je viens récupérer mes flèches

Je te donne un baiser fripon!""

""Grimpe aussi haut que tu veux
Que tu peux et tu croques, et tu picores
Puis tu grignotes, et puis tu
Redescends plus vite encore
Me donner le baiser dû!""

Quand la belle eut tout rongé
Tout mangé
""Je te paierai, me dit-elle
A pleine bouche quand les
Nigauds seront pourvus d'ailes
Et que tu sauras voler!""

""Monte m'embrasser si tu veux, si tu peux
Mais dis-toi que, si tu tombes
Je n'aurais pas la larme à l'œil
Dis-toi que, si tu succombes
Je ne porterai pas le deuil!""

Toutes mordues
Toutes grignotées, mes amandes
Ma récolte était perdue
Mais sa jolie bouche gourmande
En baisers m'a tout rendu!

Mais vint l'automne, et la foudre
Et la pluie, et les autans

Georges Brassens,"Jamais sur terre il n'y eut d'amoureux
Plus aveugles que moi dans tous les âges
Mais faut dire que je m'étais creuvé les yeux

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Le ciel l'avait pourvue des mille appas
Qui vous font prendre feu dès qu'on y touche

Ne savais plus où donner de la bouche

Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Elle n'avait pas de tête, elle n'avait pas
L'esprit beaucoup plus grand qu'un dé à coudre

Aux filles d'avoir inventé la poudre

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Puis un jour elle a pris la clef des champs
En me laissant à l'âme un mal funeste
Et toutes les herbes de la Saint-Jean
N'ont pas pu me guérir de cette peste

J'lui en ai bien voulu, mais à présent
J'ai plus d'rancune et mon cœur lui pardonne
D'avoir mis mon cœur à feu et à sang
Pour qu'il ne puisse plus servir à personne

Georges Brassens,"Moi, mes amours d'antan c'était de la grisette
Margot, la blanche caille, et Fanchon, la cousette...
Pas la moindre noblesse, excusez-moi du peu,
C'étaient, me direz-vous, des grâces roturières,
Des nymphes de ruisseau, des Vénus de barrière...
Mon prince, on a les dam's du temps jadis - qu'on peut...

Car le cœur à vingt ans se pose où l'œil se pose,
Le premier cotillon venu vous en impose,
La plus humble bergère est un morceau de roi.
Ça manquait de marquise, on connut la soubrette,
Faute de fleur de lys on eut la pâquerette,
Au printemps Cupidon fait flèche de tout bois...

On rencontrait la belle aux Puces, le dimanche :
""Je te plais, tu me plais..."" et c'était dans la manche,
Et les grands sentiments n'étaient pas de rigueur.
""Je te plais, tu me plais. Viens donc beau militaire""
Dans un train de banlieue on partait pour Cythère,
On n'était pas tenu même d'apporter son cœur...

Mimi, de prime abord, payait guère de mine,
Chez son fourreur sans doute on ignorait l'hermine,
Son habit sortait point de l'atelier d'un dieu...
Mais quand, par-dessus le moulin de la Galette,
Elle jetait pour vous sa parure simplette,
C'est Psyché tout entier' qui vous sautait aux yeux.

Au second rendez-vous y' avait parfois personne,
Elle avait fait faux bond, la petite amazone,
Mais l'on ne courait pas se pendre pour autant...
La marguerite commence avec Suzette,
On finissait de l'effeuiller avec Lisette
Et l'amour y trouvait quand même son content.

C'étaient, me direz-vous, des grâces roturières,
Des nymphes de ruisseau, des Vénus de barrière,
Mais c'étaient mes amours, excusez-moi du peu,

Auraient bien mis leur bourse à plat
Pour s'offrir ces deux guignes-là,

Georges Brassens,"J'ai perdu mes bajou's, j'ai perdu ma bedaine,
Et, ce, d'une façon si nette, si soudaine,
Qu'on me suppose un mal qui ne pardonne pas,
Qui se rit d'Esculape et le laisse baba.

Le monstre do Loch Ness ne faisant plus recette
Durant les moments creux dans certaines gazettes,
Systématiquement, les nécrologues jou'nt,
À me mettre au linceul sous des feuilles de chou.

Or, lassé de servir de tête de massacre,
Des contes à mourir debout qu'on me consacre,
Moi qui me porte bien, qui respir' la santé,
Je m'avance et je cri' toute la vérité.

Toute la vérité, messieurs, je vous la livre
Si j'ai quitté les rangs des plus de deux cents livres,
see'est la faute à Mimi, à Lisette, à Ninon,
Et bien d'autres, j'ai pas la mémoire des noms.

Si j'ai trahi les gros, les joufflus, les obèses,
see'est que je baise, que je baise, que je baise
Comme un bouc, un bélier, une bête, une brut',
Je suis hanté : le rut, le rut, le rut, le rut !

Qu'on me comprenne bien, j'ai l'âme do satyre
Et son comportement, mais ça ne veut point dire
Que j'en ai' le talent, le géni', loin s'en faut !
Pas une seule encor' ne m'a crié "" bravo ! ""

Entre autres fines fleurs, je compte, sur ma liste
Rose, un bon nombre de femmes de journalistes
Qui, me pensant fichu, mettent toute leur foi
A m'donner do bonheur une dernière fois.

see'est beau, see'est généreux, see'est grand, see'est magnifique !
Et, dans les positions les plus pornographiques,
Je leur rends les honneurs à fesses rabattu's
Sur des tas de bouillons, des paquets d'invendus.

Et voilà ce qui fait que, quand vos légitimes
Montrent leurs fesse' au peuple ainsi qu'à vos intimes,
On peut souvent why lire, imprimés à l'envers,
Les échos, les petits potins, les faits divers.

Et si vous entendez sourdre, à travers les plinthes
do boudoir de ces dam's, des râles et des plaintes,
Ne dites pas : ""see'est tonton Georges qui expire "",
Ce sont tout simplement les anges qui soupirent.

Et si vous entendez crier comme en quatorze :
""Debout ! Debout les morts ! "" ne bombez pas le torse,
see'est l'épouse exalté' d'un rédacteur en chef
Qui m'incite à monter à l'assaut derechef.

Certe', il m'arrive bien, revers de la médaille,
De laisser quelquefois des plum's à la bataille...
Hippocrate dit : "" Oui, see'est des crêtes de coq"",
Et Gallien répond ""Non, see'est des gonocoqu's... ""

Tous les deux ont raison. Vénus parfois vous donne
De méchants coups de pied qu'un bon chrétien pardonne,
Car, s'ils causent do tort aux attributs virils,
Ils mettent rarement l'existence en péril.

Eh bien, oui, j'ai tout ça, rançon de mes fredaines.

De garder les dehors de la civilité ?
Qu'on me demande au moins si j'ai fait bonne pêche
Qu'on daigne s'enquérir enfin de ma santé

De grâce, un minimum d'attentions délicates
Pour ce pauvre mari qu'on couvre de safran

Ont encor ce toupet de lorgner ma portion

Que l'on partage aussi la chère et la boisson ?

Chacun, pour ses amis, tous les deux ils sont morts

Maintenant, chers tontons, que les temps ont coulé
Que vos veuves de guerre ont enfin convolé
Que l'on a requinqué, dans le ciel de Verdun
Les étoiles ternies du maréchal Pétain

Maintenant que vos controverses se sont tues
Qu'on s'est bien partagé les cordes des pendus
Maintenant que John Bull nous boude, maintenant
Que c'en est fini des querelles d'Allemand

Que vos fill's et vos fils vont, la main dans la main
Faire l'amour ensemble et l'Europ' de demain
Qu'ils se soucient de vos batailles presque autant
Que l'on se souciait des guerres de Cent Ans

Vous l'ami les Tommies, vous l'ami des Teutons
Que, de vos vérités, vos contrevérités
Tout le monde s'en fiche à l'unanimité

De vos épurations, vos collaborations
Vos abominations et vos désolations
De vos plats de choucroute et vos tasses de thé

Elles ne font plus beaucoup d'ombre, vos deux croix
Et, petit à petit, vous voilà devenus

Maintenant, j'en suis sûr, chers malheureux tontons
Vous, l'ami des Tommies, vous, l'ami des Teutons
Si vous aviez vécu, si vous étiez ici
C'est vous qui chanteriez la chanson que voici

Chanteriez, en trinquant ensemble à vos santés
Qu'il est fou de perdre la vie pour des idées
Des idées comme ça, qui viennent et qui font
Trois petits tours, trois petits morts, et puis s'en vont

Qu'aucune idée sur terre est digne d'un trépas
Qu'il faut laisser ce rôle à ceux qui n'en ont pas
Que prendre, sur-le-champ, l'ennemi comme il vient
C'est de la bouillie pour les chats et pour les chiens

Qu'au lieu de mettre en joue quelque vague ennemi
Mieux vaut attendre un peu qu'on le change en ami
Mieux vaut tourner sept fois sa crosse dans la main
Mieux vaut toujours remettre une salve à demain

Que les seuls généraux qu'on doit suivre aux talons
Ce sont les généraux des p'tits soldats de plomb
Ainsi, chanteriez-vous tous les deux en suivant
Malbrough qui va-t-en guerre au pays des enfants

O vous, qui prenez aujourd'hui la clé des cieux
Vous, les heureux coquins qui, ce soir, verrez Dieu
Quand vous rencontrerez mes deux oncles, là-bas
Offrez-leur de ma part ces ""Ne m'oubliez pas""

Ça n'fait rien, y a des étudiants bien singuliers...

 pas ça, madam', pas ça, mille et un coups de bottes
ont tant usé le fond que, si vous essayiez
d'la mettre à votr' mari, bientôt, je vous en fiche
mon billet, il aurait du verglas sur les miches. 
Ça n'fait rien, il y a des ménages bien singuliers...
et j'étais là, tout nu, sur le bord du trottoir-e
exhibant, malgré moi, mes humbles génitoires.
une petit' vertu rentrant de travailler,
elle qui, chaque soir, en voyait un' douzaine,
courut dire aux agents :  j'ai vu que'qu' chos' d'obscène ! 
Ça n'fait rien, il y a des tapins bien singuliers...
le r'présentant d'la loi vint, d'un pas débonnaire.
sitôt qu'il m'aperçut il s'écria :  tonnerre !
on est en plein hiver et si vous vous geliez ! 
et de peur que j'n'attrape une fluxion d'poitrine,
le bougre, il me couvrit avec sa pèlerine.
Ça n'fait rien, il y a des flics bien singuliers...
et depuis ce jour-là, moi, le fier, le bravache,
moi, dont le cri de guerr' fut toujours  mort aux vaches ! 
plus une seule fois je n'ai pu le brailler.
j'essaye bien encor, mais ma langue honteuse
retombe lourdement dans ma bouche pâteuse.
Ça n'fait rien, nous vivons un temps bien singulier...",L' Épave,1998

Des tas d'enterrements vous passent sous le nez

Mais où sont les funéraill's d'antan ?
Les petits corbillards, corbillards, corbillards, corbillards

Et c'est bien attristant
Les belles pompes funèbres de nos vingt ans

Maintenant, les corbillards à tombeau grand ouvert
Emportent les trépassés jusqu'au diable vauvert

D'voir leurs héritiers marron marcher dans le crottin

Georges Brassens,"Gaztibelza, l'homme à la carabine

Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Quelqu’un a-t-il connu Sabine

Vraiment, la reine eût près d’elle été laide
Quand vers le soir
Elle passait sur le pont de Tolède
En corset noir
Un chapelet du temps de Charlemagne
Ornait son cou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Le roi disait, en la voyant si belle
A son neveu:
Pour un baiser pour un sourire d’elle
Pour un cheveu
Infant don Ruy, je donnerais l’Espagne
Et le Pérou!
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Je ne sais pas si j’aimais cette dame
Mais je sais bien
Que pour avoir un regard de son âme
Moi pauvre chien
J’aurais gaiement passé dix ans au bagne
Sous les verrous
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Quand je voyais cette enfant, moi le pâtre
De ce canton
Je croyais voir la belle Cléopâtre

Georges Brassens,"Du temps que régnait le Grand Pan,
Les dieux protégaient les ivrognes
Des tas de génies titubants
Au nez rouge, à la rouge trogne.
Dès qu'un homme vidait les cruchons,
Qu'un sac à vin faisait carousse
Ils venaient en bande à ses trousses
Compter les bouchons.
La plus humble piquette était alors bénie,
Distillée par Noé, Silène, et compagnie.
Le vin donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et le moindre pochard avait tout de Bacchus.

{Refrain:}
Mais en se touchant le crâne, en criant "" J'ai trouvé ""
La bande au professeur Nimbus est arrivée
Qui s'est mise à frapper les cieux d'alignement,
Chasser les Dieux du Firmament.

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens boivent encore,
Et le feu du nectar fait toujours luire les trognes.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus pour les ivrognes.
Bacchus est alcoolique, et le grand Pan est mort.

Quand deux imbéciles heureux
S'amusaient à des bagatelles,
Un tas de génies amoureux

Venaient leur tenir la chandelle.
Du fin fond du champs élysées
Dès qu'ils entendaient un "" Je t'aime "",
Ils accouraient à l'instant même
Compter les baisers.
La plus humble amourette
Etait alors bénie
Sacrée par Aphrodite, Eros, et compagnie.
L'amour donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et la moindre amoureuse avait tout de Vénus.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les c?urs battent encore,
Et la règle du jeu de l'amour est la même.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui s'aiment.
Vénus s'est faite femme, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et quand fatale sonnait l'heure
De prendre un linceul pour costume
Un tas de génies l'?il en pleurs
Vous offraient des honneurs posthumes.
Et pour aller au céleste empire,
Dans leur barque ils venaient vous prendre.
C'était presque un plaisir de rendre
Le dernier soupir.
La plus humble dépouille était alors bénie,
Embarquée par Caron, Pluton et compagnie.
Au pire des minus, l'âme était accordée,
Et le moindre mortel avait l'éternité.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens passent encore,
Mais la tombe est hélas la dernière demeure
Les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui meurent.
La mort est naturelle, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et l'un des dernier dieux, l'un des derniers suprêmes,
Ne doit plus se sentir tellement bien lui-même
Un beau jour on va voir le Christ
Descendre du calvaire en disant dans sa lippe
"" Merde je ne joue plus pour tous ces pauvres types.
J'ai bien peur que la fin du monde soit bien triste. """,Le Grand Pan,1998
Georges Brassens,"Jamais sur terre il n'y eut d'amoureux

Un' jolie vach' déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mèn' par le bout du cur

Puis un jour elle a pris la clef des champs
En me laissant à l'âme un mal funeste
Et toutes les herbes de la Saint-Jean
N'ont pas pu me guérir de cette peste

J' lui en ai bien voulu, mais à présent
J'ai plus d'rancune et mon cur lui pardonne
D'avoir mis mon cur à feu et à sang

J'suis tombé sur une belle

Accrochés à une branche
Une branche de lilas

Pauvre amour, tiens bon la barre

Et le temps est un barbare
Dans le genre d'Attila

Aux cœurs où son cheval passe

Aux quatre coins de l'espace
Il fait le désert sous ses pas

Envolées dans l'au-delà

L'idée est excellente
Moi j'ai failli mourir de ne l'avoir pas eue

Multitude accablante

Abjurant ses erreurs se rallie à leur foi

Jugeant qu'il n'y a pas
Péril en la demeure
Allons vers l'autre monde en flânant en chemin
Car, à forcer l'allure
Il arrive qu'on meure
Pour des idées n'ayant plus cours le lendemain

Or, s'il est une chose
Amère, désolante
En rendant l'âme à Dieu, c'est bien de constater
Qu'on a fait fausse route, qu'on s'est trompé d'idée

D'accord, mais de mort lente

Les Saint Jean bouche d'or

C'est leur raison de vivre, ils ne s'en privent pas 

Dans presque tous les camps
On en voit qui supplantent
Bientôt Mathusalem dans la longévité
J'en conclus qu'ils doivent se dire
En aparté, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Des idées réclamant
Le fameux sacrifice 
Les sectes de tout poil en offrent des séquelles

Aux victimes novices

Quand il les voit venir
Avec leur gros drapeau 
Le sage, en hésitant
Tourne autour du tombeau, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Encore s'il suffisait
De quelques hécatombes 
Pour qu'enfin tout changeât, qu'enfin tout s'arrangeât 
Depuis tant de ""grands soirs"" que tant de têtes tombent 
Au paradis sur terre, on y serait déjà 

Mais l'âge d'or sans cesse
Est remis aux calendes

Ô vous, les boutefeuxà
Ô vous les bons apôtres 
Mourez donc les premiers, nous vous cédons le pas 
Mais de grâce, morbleu!
Laissez vivre les autres! 
La vie est à peu près leur seul luxe ici-bas 

Car, enfin, la Camarde
Est assez vigilante

Si l'amour vaut pas la chandelle
Pourquoi le joue-t-elle à loisir
Si quiconque peut, sans ambages

Le pluriel ne vaut rien à l'homme et sitôt qu'on
Est plus de quatre on est une bande de cons.
Bande à part, sacrebleu ! c'est ma règle et j'y tiens.
Dans les noms des partants on n'verra pas le mien.

Dieu ! que de processions, de monomes, de groupes,
Que de rassemblements, de cortèges divers, -
Que de ligu's, que de cliqu's, que de meut's, que de troupes !
Pour un tel inventaire il faudrait un Prévert.

Le pluriel ne vaut rien à l'homme et sitôt qu'on

Bande à part, sacrebleu ! c'est ma règle et j'y tiens.
Parmi les cris des loups on n'entend pas le mien.

Oui, la cause était noble, était bonne, était belle !
Nous étions amoureux, nous l'avons épousée.
Nous souhaitions être heureux tous ensemble avec elle,
Nous étions trop nombreux, nous l'avons défrisée.

Je suis celui qui passe à côté des fanfares
Et qui chante en sourdine un petit air frondeur.
Je dis, à ces messieurs que mes notes effarent :

J'aime mieux m'amuser tout seul, cré nom de nom !
Je suis celui qui reste à l'écart des partouzes.

Le pluriel ne vaut rien à l'homme et sitôt qu'on
Est plus de quatre on est une bande de cons.
Bande à part, sacrebleu ! c'est ma règle et j'y tiens.
Au faisceau des phallus on n'verra pas le mien.

Pas jaloux pour un sou des morts des hécatombes,
J'espère être assez grand pour m'en aller tout seul.
Je ne veux pas qu'on m'aide à descendre à la tombe,
Je partage n'importe quoi, pas mon linceul.

Par les gosses battus, par l'ivrogne qui rentre
Par l'âne qui reçoit des coups de pied au ventre
Et par l'humiliation de l'innocent châtié

Par le fils dont la mère a été insultée
Je vous salue, Marie.

Par la vieille qui, trébuchant sous trop de poids
S'écrie: "" Mon Dieu ! "" par le malheureux dont les bras

Par tous ceux dont la chair se déchire ou succombe
Par ceux qui sont sans pieds, par ceux qui sont sans mains

Et par le juste mis au rang des assassins
Je vous salue, Marie.

Par la mère apprenant que son fils est guéri
Par l'oiseau rappelant l'oiseau tombé du nid

Quand tout fut consommé, je leur ai dit : ""Messieurs

Puis ils m'ont embrassé d'une étrange façon

Leur compassion semblait venir du cœur. Bravo !

Quand je suis ressorti de ce champ de navets
L'ombre de l'ici-gît pas à pas me suivait
Une petite croix de trois fois rien du tout
Faisant, à elle seul', de l'ombre un peu partout

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Les revenants s'en mêlaient à leur tour. Bravo !

J'ai compris ma méprise un petit peu plus tard
Quand, allumant ma pipe avec le faire-part
J'm'aperçus que mon nom, comm' celui d'un bourgeois
Occupait sur la liste une place de choix

Et puis ne sachant plus où finir ma soirée
Je lui tins compagnie dans la chapelle ardente

Pour endiguer ses pleurs pour apaiser ses maux
Je me mis à blaguer à sortir des bons mots

Elle me demanda si je n'avais pas faim
Ça le ferait-il revenir ajouta-t-elle
De pousser la piété jusqu'à l'inanition

Et nous fîmes un petit souper aux chandelles

Retroussant l'insolente avec nulle tendresse
Conscient d'accomplir somme toute un devoir

Paf j'abattis sur elle une main vengeresse 

Aïe  vous m'avez fêlé le postérieur en deux  
Se plaignit-elle et je baissai le front piteux
Craignant avoir frappé de façon trop brutale
Mais j'appris par la suite et j'en fus bien content
Que cet état de chos's durait depuis longtemps 
Menteuse  la fêlure était congénitale

Quand je levai la main pour la deuxième fois
Le cœur n'y était plus j'avais perdu la foi
Surtout qu'elle s'était enquise la bougresse

Entre vous, plus de controverses

Cons caducs ou cons débutants
Petits cons d'la dernière averse
Vieux cons des neiges d'antan
Petits cons d'la dernière averse
Vieux cons des neiges d'antan
Vous, les cons naissants
Les cons innocents
Les jeunes cons
Qui, n'le niez pas
Prenez les papas 
Pour des cons
Vous, les cons âgés
Les cons usagés
Les vieux cons 
Qui, confessez-le
Prenez les p'tits bleus 
Pour des cons
Méditez l'impartial message 
D'un qui balance entre deux âges

Le temps ne fait rien à l'affaire
Quand on est con, on est con
Qu'on ait vingt ans, qu'on soit grand-père
Quand on est con, on est con
Entre vous, plus de controverses

Georges Brassens,"Un vingt-deux de septembre au diable vous partîtes
Et, depuis, chaque année, à la date susdite
Je mouillais mon mouchoir en souvenir de vous
Or, nous y revoilà, mais je reste de pierre
Plus une seule larme à me mettre aux paupières
Le vingt-deux de septembre, aujourd'hui, je m'en fous
On ne reverra plus au temps des feuilles mortes
Cette âme en peine qui me ressemble et qui porte
Le deuil de chaque feuille en souvenir de vous
Que le brave Prévert et ses escargots veuillent
Bien se passer de moi pour enterrer les feuilles
Le vingt-deux de septembre, aujourd'hui, je m'en fous
Jadis, ouvrant mes bras comme une paire d'ailes
Je montais jusqu'au ciel pour suivre l'hirondelle
Et me rompais les os en souvenir de vous
Le complexe d'Icare à présent m'abandonne
L'hirondelle en partant ne fera plus l'automne
Le vingt-deux de septembre, aujourd'hui, je m'en fous
Pieusement noué d'un bout de vos dentelles
J'avais, sur ma fenêtre, un bouquet d'immortelles
Que j'arrosais de pleurs en souvenir de vous
Je m'en vais les offrir au premier mort qui passe
Les regrets éternels à présent me dépassent
Le vingt-deux de septembre, aujourd'hui, je m'en fous
Désormais, le petit bout de cœur qui me reste
Ne traversera plus l'équinoxe funeste
En battant la breloque en souvenir de vous
Il a craché sa flamme et ses cendres s'éteignent
À peine y pourrait-on rôtir quatre châtaignes
Le vingt-deux de septembre, aujourd'hui, je m'en fous
Et c'est triste de n'être plus triste sans vous",Le Vingt-Deux Septembre,1998
Georges Brassens,"Dans l'eau de la claire fontaine
Elle se baignait toute nue
Une saute de vent soudaine
Jeta ses habits dans les nues

En détresse, elle me fit signe
Pour la vêtir, d'aller chercher
Des monceaux de feuilles de vigne
Fleurs de lis ou fleurs d'oranger

Avec des pétales de roses
Un bout de corsage lui fis
La belle n'était pas bien grosse
Une seule rose a suffi

Avec le pampre de la vigne
Un bout de cotillon lui fis
Mais la belle était si petite
Qu'une seule feuille a suffi

Elle me tendit ses bras, ses lèvres
Comme pour me remercier
Je les pris avec tant de fièvre
Qu'ell' fut toute déshabillée

Le jeu dut plaire à l'ingénue
Car, à la fontaine souvent
Ell' s'alla baigner toute nue
En priant Dieu qu'il fit du vent
Qu'il fit du vent",Dans l'Eau de la Claire Fontaine,1998
