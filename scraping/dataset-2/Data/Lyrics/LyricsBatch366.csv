Homesick James Williamson,"Oh, I've got no one to have fun with
Since my baby's love had been done with
Well, I don't know what to do
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Well, no one to call me sweet names
And my heart is filled with pain
Oh, I only think of you
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Blues found in my bloodstream
Blues found in my home
Blues found in my soul
I got blues all in my bones

Oh, no one to depend on
Since my baby's love had been gone
Oh, I don't know what to do
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Oh yeah
Come here, baby

Oh, no one to depend on
Since my baby's love has been gone
Whoa, I don't know what to do
I sit and cry and sing the blues
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Hometown News,"I can remember,like it was yesterday
When daddy sold his Corvair and we watched it drive away
Well,then we walked down the corner with the money that he got
He bought a Mr. Cruiser off of Mr.Kelly's lot

Well,that station wagon was the ugliest thing around
And I'd hide beneath the dashboard everytime we drove through town
Now,21 years later,(21 years later)I got a wife and kid
And I'm standin' here on Kelly's lot,just like my daddy did

And I'm singin'
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys are in my pocket
I've got the title in my hand
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan

Sellin' that four by four really hurt my pride
But the cold,hard fact was the lack of room inside
Well,so long to my gone good days,I don't cruise for chicks no more
Now it's luggage racks,and fruit juice packs,and an extra slidin' door

And I'm singin'
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys in my hand
I've got the keys in my pocket
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan

I can see us on the highway,baby's fast asleep
Momma reads a book and I'm in the driver's seat
Headin' off to places we never been before
With everything I need and room for more

Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys are in my pocket
Yeah,I've got the title in my hand
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan",Minivan,2002
Homewreckers,"Someday I'm gonna be famous, do I have talent well no
These days you don't really need it thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel, can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab

'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity

I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way
And I'll get community service no matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids, they'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down the more my price goes up

'Cause when you're a celebrity
It adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity

So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of the fun and the sun
We'll be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
Hey hey Hollywood here we come

'Cause when you're a celebrity
It adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV",Celebrity,2004
Homewreckers,"Well I love her
And I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things
And she'd be gone by noon

Well I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
That I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite

Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No tellin' what I might catch today

So I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me

Homewreckers,"Well, I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't' even act like I was mad
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

Well, that's just like last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was goin' off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isn't 'cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections, it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

When she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't wanna wake her up
Yeah, I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah, I live for little moments like that",Little Moments,2004
Homewreckers,"I've got some big news 
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake   

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

Moonlight on a duck blind     
Catfish on a trotline
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little camp fire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere there's only way to get there

Homewreckers,"On his side of the bed
He's sleeping like a baby
Dreams are dancing in his head
Lying with his lady
It's a peaceful night
And everything's just fine
On his side of the bed

But on her side of the bed
Those big brown eyes are cryin
From the things he never says
Deep inside she's dyin
As she turns to face the wall
There's no love at all 
On her side of the bed

If he'd just reach out
She'd forget about 
All the times that he let her down
Oh but in his mind
Everything's alright
When the lights go out

Now on his side of the bed
He never even noticed
Her negligee of red
The very same one that she wore 
The night that they were wed
But he never turned his head
To her side of the bed

If he'd just reach out
She'd forget about 
All the times that he let her down
Oh but in his mind 
Everything's alright
When the lights go out

Now on his side of the bed
He wakes up and turns to say I love you
But instead 
All he finds are pages 
Full of words she never said
And that's all she left 
On her side of the bed",The Bed,2004
Homewreckers,"I don't need whiskey to drown out the pain
Or some old umbrella to hold off the rain
Don't have to cross over a river of tears
All that I need is right here

Holding you holds me together
When holding on gets just a little too hard
When this tight rope I travel
Begins to unravel and I feel like
I'm falling apart
Holding you holds me together

You know life's a freight liner on
A runaway track
But I'll take the ride knowing
That you'll bring me back
No fate's too uncertain no distance too far
As long as you're here in my arms

Holding you holds me together
When holding on gets just a little too hard
When this tight rope I travel
Begins to unravel and I feel like
I'm falling apart
Holding you holds me together

Whenever I hold you tight
This crazy world of mine falls right in place
Whenever the trouble is
You find a way to give back what it takes",Holdin' You,2004
Homewreckers,"In a sandalwood frame
We bought in New Mexico
I was wearin' the chain that old Indian made
That we practically stole

Little shells in a jar
We found Hanalei Bay
Got those matchin tattos 
And those ten dollar shoes
To remember our stay

[Chorus:]
If it hadn't been so good I wouldn't feel so sad
If we hadn't been so happy baby,
It wouldn't hurt this bad,
If you had told me this last summer
I'd be on the floor laughin'
Instead of standing round breakin' down
Wonderin' what happened

What am I supposed to do
Without my very best friend
Boy you left me in shock and tied up in knots
Then it hits me again

Homewreckers,"I've never done anything 
That would bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling I'll admit
They're been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on My mind

[Chorus]

When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down 
Between the champaigne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone and I was missing you
He never had the chance cause I broke up the dance 
Before the song was through

Homewreckers,"[Chorus:]
When it rains I pour a couple more rounds
'Til the hurtin' and the heartache start to drown
I turn out the light, I turn up Dwight
And I lock my door when it rains
When it rains I pour

When life ain't going my way
And I can't take one more day of gray
Hey hey it's OK
I don't need a dose of Dr. Phil
I don't need your make it all better pill
When I'm low
Don't you know, don't you know

I don't have to have a girls night out
Or runaround with a rowdy crowd to get down
Whiskey bent and hell bound
When I feel like I ain't got a friend
I just call on my old buddy Jim again
And again I like him

Homewreckers,"Thousands of people
Live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there
On that busy street
Those feelings came back again

There was no where to run
No where to hide
He walked up to me
Looked in my eyes

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him
Still

He said how've you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doin' fine
We talked
As the people rushed by

We laughed about old times
And all we went through
That's when he hugged me
And said I've missed you

And still

I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart 
Saying I loved him

That's when she walked up to him
He said this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we gotta go now

Homewreckers,"At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's 'bout ready to give up
That's when she says,""I've been there before
But keep on lookin' 'cause maybe who you're lookin' for is""
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody
Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody
Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on

Hope you're feeling better tomorrow night
Don't put up a fight
It'll do you no good

Hello, Uncle Freedom
I've seen them down on their knees for you
Nothing they wouldn't do
To have you along

I got too many problems
They just don't understand
They think their every wish
Is my command

Oh no, Sister Susie
You're in a win or lose affair
Wish I could be there
To help you along

Oh yes, Brother Michael
We all have every faith in you
And everything you do
All the way round

I got too many problems
They just don't understand
They think their every wish
Is my command

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Honest Touch,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat

Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs

I wanted to say for quite some time
I think you know what I wanna say
'Cause I'm sure it's bothering you, too.
You've got me so involved a little too deep, 
And you can't find a way to work it out.
Well, I go on hung as far as I can, 
And it's time to come for us to talk it out.
I'm sure she wants to know, too.
Just what you intend to do?

Won't you be man enough?

Don't tear my life up if you don't wanna be with me

Are you touching her like you're touching me?
Which one of us you need?

Hung up on a man and you're caught in that old
Familiar way of wanting someone who don't want you

And they're masters of getting control of our minds
And making us depedent on them
Hmm! Well, girls,
I was in that weaken boat on trouble waters for years
And believe me, I've been through it all
But this fool got wise
I remember the man I used to love or thought I loved
He used to treat me in any old way'
But still I love the ground he walked on
I was blind as a bat, and I couldn't see for looking
And when he left, I thought my world ended
But you know, time soon healed my wounds
And I've found my new beginning
I just wish he was here so I could tell him

As I look back on the day you left me
I felt that love had forsaken me
As time went by, tears began to dry
Now I see you never really cared

Got mad and closed the door.

You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you,

Thank you, baby.

Go your own way, don't think twice about me.

I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, when you came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive

Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them

Something to Believe In

Did you come here for the show

Or to meet someone you might or might not know

It doesn't matter to me

Did you smile your way in through the back door

With a stamp on your hand from the night before?

It doesn't matter to me


'Cause when I open up my eyes

And you're looking at me

I get the feeling that I

Know just what you need

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe in


Every day we get up and go

Pack our things in a different town

And head on down the road

We got somewhere to be

People follow as far as they can

I don't pretend that I understand

When they tell me I'm changing their lives

With the songs I sing


'Cause when I open up my eyes

And you're looking at me

I get the feeling that I

Know just what you need

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe in


I wish that I could be the one they needed

Every night I pray, asking what to say

To give them

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe In


'Cause when I open up my eyes

And you're looking at me

I get the feeling that I

Know just what you need

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe in

Somewhere to belong

Đi đâu loanh quanh cho đời mỏi mệt
Trên hai vai ta đôi vầng nhật nguyệt
Rọi suốt trăm năm một cõi đi về

Lời nào của cây lời nào cỏ lạ
Một chiều ngồi say một đời thật nhẹ ngày qua
Vừa tàn mùa xuân rồi tàn mùa hạ
Một ngày đầu thu nghe chân ngựa về chốn xa

Mây che trên đầu và nắng trên vai
Đôi chân ta đi sông còn ở lại
Con tim yêu thương vô tình chợt gọi
Lại thấy trong ta hiện bóng con người

Nghe mưa nơi này lại nhớ mưa xa
Mưa bay trong ta bay từng hạt nhỏ
Trăm năm vô biên chưa từng hội ngộ
Chẳng biết nơi nao là chốn quê nhà

Đường chạy vòng quanh một vòng tiều tụy
Một bờ cỏ non một bờ mộng mị ngày xưa
Từng lời tà dương là lời mộ địa
Từng lời bể sông nghe ra từ độ suối khe

Trong khi ta về lại nhớ ta đi
Đi lên non cao đi về biển rộng
Đôi tay nhân gian chưa từng độ lượng
Ngọn gió hoang vu thổi suốt xuân thì

Hôm nay ta say ôm đời ngủ muộn
Để sớm mai đây lại tiếc xuân thì",Mot Coi Di Ve,

I'm just one of a million or more stories that could be told

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

My name is Leonard Peltier
I am a Lakota and Anishnabe
And I am living in the United States penitentiary
Which is the swiftest growing
Indian reservations in the country

I have been in prison since 1976
For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation
There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement
And The FBI and the local Sheriffs State Troopers
Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered

Three of us were charged with the deaths of the FBI agents
My co-defendants were found not-guilty by reasons of self-defense
My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian
people
The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents
Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it
But someone has to pay for the crime

There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell
And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror
That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended

[Chorus:]

But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice
To make things better for our people
The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it
Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago
Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made
Some gave their lives
Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arm",Sacrifice,2005

We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you

I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

I am sure to lose

But now I'm seeing why
You're always on my mind
No one else has ever made me open up my eyes
You're the one that made me realize, realize

I've been incomplete
Missing a part of me
Blinded by the fear of something new
But now I see
All along what's missing has been you

Try to find a missing piece
To fill a hole in me
A lonely mystery
Thought I had it figured out
But then you came along

I knew that I was wrong, I was wrong

I've been incomplete
Missing a part of me
Blinded by the fear of something new

And now I know I'll never be the same

On top of the clouds on the buildings
Cut a little class cause my life is like a field trip
Where we stayin' tonight? Am I playing it right?
And can I knock it out of the park like late in the 9th
Cause everyone in the crowd loves a comeback
So name a city that I'm in and I run that
It's all trickery play the hickory dickery

They be lookin' for world peace by they end up with Art
Testing, testing, one, two, three heres the microphone
I kick it with the Hoodie Mob, and now I feel like Al Capone
But you the biggest drama queen, fine you won the trophy
Cause the only time you like genuine is on the pony
I hit the gold mine, I'm trying to whore this

You in the Upper West Side
You were thinking other people
Would've never accepted all your assets?
I'm and you cash par

You a small town girl but you living in the city
So you always keep your heart near your passport

I don't know what's next for us
But every time I talk it's like I messed it up
People wanna tell me that I'm too honest
Walking on eggshells, two omelettes
And I know it's hard cause you left your town
Dad don't call like he let you down
You don't wanna talk when the sun is out
But if we get a little drunk, then it's all allowed
And the truth comes down, it's pouring pouring
Bout to drop bombs like Warren, Moon

Hoodie Allen,"I said my tour just sold out
Album's been bought out, girlfriend might put out terrific
Oh that's the good route, shit that you dream 'bout
Now that you got it feels different
I don't need no one, no one to tell me
Everything will be alright
Hair just like Elvis, hands on her pelvis
But let me delve in

I said I got a lot of dreams and you got a lot of needs
So there ain't a lot of time for me to help it
And I ain't slept in nearly twenty weeks, is that healthy?
I'm making money when I go to sleep, is that wealthy?
I'd rather talk about my self esteem but that's selfish
Lot of folks complain about the cards that you dealt me
But I'm still here shuffling the deck, yo what's come of it?
Used to know it all, now I'd rather just discover it
So fuck it, man
I said fuck it, man
Yo, fuck it, man, I'm just a lucky man

Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore

She like ""oh you so worried about getting broads and shit""
Comin' to my shows just to hear applause and shit
They get mad at me when the fans throw they bras and shit
Tryna tell me that it ain't part of my job descrip
I'm re-writing the history either way you interpret it
My life is like a circus the way these clowns have been surfacing
But you had my back, you memorized every word
Maybe bridges are meant to be burned
And when he gave you passes, I was gassed I can't lie
But I was busy living out my passions, that's why
My friend's just laugh, it's funny
The type of shit I'm mad at
90% Is love, but all we hear is the bad
I wish I could take back the time we wasted talking 'bout you
I wish I could take back the time we wasted being mad
The funny thing about it's that I'm better off without you
It'd be worse if nothing changed
So now I'm glad that I matter on my own
Yeah I matter on my own
Really out here on my own dog
And I just thought that you should know

Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore, oh oh

And I don't want to let this thing go
'Cause they leaving me with nothing, nothing
Leaving me with nothing, nothing
On my own
I'd rather just watch it all grow
'Cause at least I got something, something
100% Of something, something
On my own

Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore

Hoodie Allen,"Yo, they say the way I act is immature
Well don't be mad at me because you're feeling insecure
The only golf I ever tried to play was miniature
And when you ask me sign your boobs I smiley face my signature
But my parents raised me right, they were sticklers
And we don't even fight, we're like oil and some vinegar
Getting a job is like a pregnant woman giving birth
You're trying to push me in the wrong direction and it fucking hurts
So most our friends already moved out of they mama's cribs
I'm still throwing parties at my house, like Stifler
So if you go around and try to tell me how to live
I'mma take your girl and Mortal Kombat finish her

But when it's done and the party shuts down
And the cops try to lay my ass on the ground
One day we might tell our kids
But until that day let's live like this

My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

Yo, and when it comes to getting older
No matter what I do, I'm never feeling like a grown up
People trying to make me change, you'd think there was a quota
Like there ain't enough unemployed motherfuckers with diplomas
Everybody waiting 'round hoping that they blow up
But I'mma make it sooner, Oklahoma
I learned to be a player, make money like I'm an owner
These other rappers are so over the hill, word to Jonah
So if you see me in a restaurant, say hi to me
And if I ask you if you like my new shit, lie to me, word to Tim Roth
And I don't know if I fit in with your society
So chill, take a pill for anxiety and doze off

But when it's late and you're all alone
And you're too damn drunk to be walking home
Then maybe you should call it quits
But until that day let's live like this

My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay
We can live however we want
And there ain't nobody that can get in our way
Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay
We gon' do whatever we want
Never gonna listen to a word you say

My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned, that every song I feature on
Has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again

For you, and for your friends

I'm doing something that's different

Good (good), 'cause I'm twenty-five, but I only look twenty
I'm trying to survive in this world that we live in
There's truth and there's lies and not every decision you choose can rewind
You might blink in a moment and this shit be over
I'm fucking it up if I'm living inside
Wasting my time on the internet
This job never ends, nowadays (nowadays)
It's the only way we earning respect
It's hard to leave when we're earning a check

Working them late nights, every night
Motivation, super high
Double shift it, over drive
Make that money, multiply
Oh lord not this, walking home I wanna quit
But I stick around for the benefits

Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
Clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it, overtime
Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it

I'm pushing back when push comes to shove
Deep down, wondering why they ain't pushing us
I got friends with deals, I got friends who front
But just keep it real, 'cause who gives a fuck
If I was Pusha T, I might push a brick
Working 24/7 just to push my shit
'Cause if I slip, there'll be twenty other rappers, quick
Trying to fit in my shoes, but my feet just too big
I can't relax, I can't even sit back
With my girl on my bed, got my face to my Mac
And I know she act disappointed in that
But how the fuck we gonna blow off a rap
So I stay grounded, never catch an ego
As far as we go it's good just believe yo
Love all my fans, without you, where would I be though?
Where would I be though?

Working them late nights, every night
Motivation, super high
Double shift it, over drive
Make that money, multiply
Oh lord not this, walking home I wanna quit

Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
Clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it, overtime
Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it

Could it be so easy, well don't believe me
'Cause you know good things always take time (it always take time)
And please don't leave me, 'cause I need you with me
And there ain't no shortcuts left in this life
And the great things take love, love
And the great things take love, love
And the great things take love, love
And the great things take love, love, love
Are you putting in work?

Overtime
Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime

Hoodie Allen,"I'm gonna talk when I wanna talk
I don't need the long distance to plan this shit
Did it on my own with no management
Must be why nobody can manage him
A&R's always want to take advantages
Find a poor kid, sell him on a fantasy
But I've always been way above the average
That's why nobody else can compare to me
Other rappers don't offend me
'Cause I got more drive than a Bentley
In the driveway with a Hemi, dream girl Rossum
I'm just tryna get an Emmy
Fuck that, I just wanna get a Grammy
Then add three more for my family
Got a plan but I never had a plan B
If you think you'll fail then you might as well drive in a Camry
And I may never get the cover of that Rolling Stone
Didn't fit the vibe they were going for
Went to XXL, but I couldn't excel
They said we really don't get it but we're wishing you well
Oh well, LOL, ain't got time for no print
Fame come and go when you rhyming so shit
Ain't gotta sign on no dotted line
But if I do, fuck you for criticizing
When I pick up the phone, they don't even call back
They just leave me a voice-mail
They gon' tell you you changed and shit ain't the same
Like this shit was a choice, hell
My haters are kicking the bucket
It must have been hard to be wrong all along
But isn't it love when they memorize every damn word of your song?

'Cause they be calling my phone but you already know
I be hitting ignore 'cause you late
I just throw it away, I don't care what they say at all
'Cause people keep talking (hey), people keep talking
But I don't hear nothing when people keep talking

One shot, two shot, three shot, super drunk
Four shot, wrong shot, jump shot, no fucks
Even when I spit it I'mma be the spitting image
Of somebody you recognize when you watching television
I'm just trying to be like Jordan, I'm tired of being Pippen
I've been coming off the bench and watching my haters get it
It's a young Jake Gyllenhaal, drop the beat 'cause I kill 'em all
Grab a seat 'cause I fill them all
Go hard motherfucker, ain't a pen involved
Y'all try to get up any way that you can
Step on the back of your favorite fan
Charging like 50 to take a quick picture
You scummy ass rappers are not in demand
And you certainly ain't in it for love
I'm just saying this shit cause it's true
I know that all of y'all wanted a bus 'cause the image important to you
Well I guess that's human nature
Selfish motherfuckers never do you favors
Till they all get dropped and they sent to waivers
Go shop get shelved like it's Lord and Taylor, what?
I'm the man in the city, well I guess that'd make you the miss
These rappers are acting all over the mic nowadays and they ain't Ludacris
You tell me you hate I exist while your girlfriend is grooving to all of my songs
She made you a Spotify playlist and there ain't no room for you dog?

'Cause they be calling my phone but you already know
I be hitting ignore 'cause you late
I just throw it away, I don't care what they say at all
'Cause people keep talking (hey), people keep talking
But I don't hear nothing when people keep talking, talking

""Hello? Um Hoodie I just wanna tell you if you’re listening
You’re my favorite artist ever, and I just watch so far
And you’re just so amazing and I love your song
'No Interruption' and oh my god 'Two Lips' oh my god
I can’t wait for the new music to come out
And um I was really wondering will you follow me in instagram?
Um, my handle is patymail 565 um, and you're underscore, I'm so sorry
Oh my god yes and you have to come back to Wisconsin because I made you
A bracelet and um oh my god I’m so nervous
I’m sorry I’m like a little girl okay um
I gotta go take shit but it was really great to
I guess talk to you okay bye Hoodie.""",People Keep Talking,2014
Hoodie Allen,"Super duper early morning Sunday breakfast
Ain't in a rush to go to church because I used protection
You complain about the way I cooked your eggs
I'll probably hang up the phone and then, hello?
Disconnected, but check it, that's just a metaphor
I'm talking if you left your man then you'd be better off
The game I spit is sweeter than a bag of kettle corn
My name is Hoodie Allen but I'm here to take your sweater off
And I'mma do whatever it takes to make us a pair
You wanna travel around the world, well I'm taking you there
I met a bunch of mean girls like Lacey Chabert
Busy talking shit but they ain't stopping to look in the mirror
If you making it bad, well I'm making it worse
You holding onto all these baggage, stop taking it pers
I'll tell you anything I can to get you down tonight
Tryna take you out the clouds, bring you down to life

I think that she like me, that she like me
And she think that it might be, it might be
The real thing but we moving too fast
The real thing but we moving too fast

I think that she like me, that she like me
And she think that it might be, it might be
True love but we let it all fade
'Cause I just ain't ready baby

Treat me like I'm the man with a couple hundred grand
And a family full of cousins with a couple Uncle Sams
Tryna gamble away my money, that's funny like Douglas Yancey
Wanna paint a perfect picture, they'll probably think that I'm Banksy
But I might die trying to afford it
I'm living in the studio, everything is recorded
My life is like a song and stuck on fucking repeat
And I'm making the same mistakes that you only make in your sleep
That must mean I'm in a dream world
But I'm sleepwalking until I find a dream girl
I got these teen girls screaming like I'm out of a magazine
Next to Harry and Justin, nobody fucking with me girl
Switch it, do I make you mad when I talk about shit that I envision?
Are my dreams too big? Do you think I'll sink or swim with these fishes?
So you could let me down easy
'Cause it's hard to let go when you the only good that I know, you know?

I think that she like me, that she like me
And she think that it might be, it might be
The real thing but we moving too fast
The real thing but we moving too fast

Hi, it's me, wondering where the hell you are.
You said you were gonna call me and I still haven't heard from you.
You know, it's not that hard to just send me a text and say hi.
I understand you're working hard on this album right now,
But you need to make the time for me.
And you need to start re-evaluating your priorities.

Asking me for money, I'm a blow it like I'm Hootie
Buffalo, where you find me, throwing Bills like I'm Flutie
She a product of the nineties, I'm a show her like I'm Truman, ooh
'Fore the night is over, she will beso me, muah
Got your girlfriend so obsessed with me, that Cecily strong
Making all of these bangers for girls who look like Topanga
Who grew up in Staten Island, banging 36 Chambers
Ya listening to history in the making now
Trying to retire at thirty with a vacation house
That money funny like Jefferson on a twenty
Ivy League like I'm hangin' out with Beyoncé and Jeezy now
Swaggin', I can see you impress
She on her knees and she ain't trying to confess
Save me the stress, ya girl already say I'm the best
She came to my show just to get my name on her chest

She call 9-1-1

We can have some fun
We could be together from now until whenever
Just call me up
And I'll put out the fire that be burning inside
We can roll in my ride and make the sirens go off
She make the sirens go ff

Okay, working 'cause I love it, do it for my people
Words are like my ammo, bang, bang, reload
Watch me as I freak flows, ball hard on these beats though
Used to take the bus, now I whip it like I'm Devo
Nowadays we sittin' court side at every Knicks game
Close enough to go and hand Carmelo my mixtape
Models in my phone book, bout to make a mistake
Tell'em spread the love like we living in the sixties
My friends say that my life is like a movie dog
I'm bangin' actress after actress like they groupies dog
She think I'm James Bond, you just an afterthought
These rappers beggin' for any song in my catalog
Working nine-to-five, but the opposite
Killing it so much, they bout to build me a monument
Tell her ""we can do it in the dorm room of your colleges
And she can rock my mothafucking world or earn an scholarship

Sippin' in a text, I got your bitch in it, don't mention it
Those who want the D and I appreciate the sentiment
Can't afford to own it, I'm just leasing it and renting it
'Cause I am not cuffing shit, I am not no odd boy
I'm more like a hot boy, Gucci leather socks boy
Fin dripping in the kitchen whippin' up the box toy
I get it for the low, I bet you get it for a lot boy
Last night at the Trump towers taking drunk showers
At the airport, they went through my bag and found a bunch of weed that was not ours
If it's not reeking than it's not sour
Smoke in her face, you don't need a vase for these bouquet, then buy flowers

Calling over from Gigantic Records.
Man we just listened to your project
I got a bunch of writers up here,
Every one in the office is flippin' out.
Man, I just wanted to call ya and let you know
That we really, really loved it
But we just wanna, you know, take it that next level man
First thing I would wanna do with you is kinda
Get you a little bit more matured.
Throw in on a bow tie every now and then, you know
Carry a cane around, and wear a grey wig.
But other than that, we really love it

Got a text from a chick who wondering if we're meeting up later
I said I don't make plans
If you want someone who can, then
You're not looking for me
You're just lookin' for another type of man
I'm just tryin' to be the first man in my fam

Caught you looking at me like you might want to undress me
Tell her I'm a good fella, like my name was Pesci
Cooking up the fliest shit and I don't need a recipe
But damn, that was vicious, ooh I admit it
I just want you to fly with me, fly with me
No other language, I can't explain it
I just want you to fly with me, fly with me
To a place where we can't be bothered
Feeling like I'm racing to the top from the bottom
Got no whips but multiple garages
I guess you could say that I'm an optimist
Had a dream I was coppin' shit
And like Copperfield it all disappeared
Had a crazy ass a long time ago
But I'm now I'm smiling from ear to ear because it all came true
Love what you do
And the love will come back to you tenfold
Felt like I had a brick tied to my leg
But I'm never gonna Ben Folds
At the top of my game like a tentpole
I ain't make it there yet but I'm Glenn Close
I'mma take her home and have her clothes hanging all over my bedpost

Dude, don't you feel like
Every song nowadays has just a complicated dance move to it?
Hoodie, I do feel like that
I can't dance like that.
That's not realistic, man.

Some Sadie Hawkins shit.

A premonition it's all about to break
I don't know what to do
To help it come on through

Hear me crying in the wilderness
I hope my signal's clear just like Paul Revere

People tell me to give Œtil it hurts
And everybody gets their just dessert
All I ask of you, remember, it takes two
It sure takes two

Watch your back, my friend
You're gonna lose your shirt
You can trust me, I never kiss and tell
Better hurry before you break the spell

There's no better time that you will find
Than the present, starting with yourself
Something's coming, start with yourself

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Maman t’avais raison, je pense à toi dans les cieux
Mesdames et messieurs
Vous avez jamais vu un rappeur se comporter comme moi
J’ai fait confiance à des tchoras
Heureusement deux-trois bonhommes peuvent tirer pour moi
Je serais né aux States j’aurais sûrement la carrière de French Montana
T’as pas mal, j’ai pas mal, H24 je fume la frappe de Ketama

J’ai préféré partir que rester sur l’ter-ter et cailler
J’ai la tête dans les nuages, mon cerveau est ailleurs

Le rap c’était mon passe-temps
J’ai jamais fait de CV
Ma mère me disait tout l’temps
“Arrête Hocine tu fais TB”
Elle a pas eu la chance de m’voir à la télé
Ici c’est Marseille c’est pas L.A
Un tel ou un tel s’est fait rafaler
J’veux partir ailleurs bébé andalé
J’ai commencé le rap sans même penser en arriver là
Hier j’étais personne, j’traînais devant l’D, j’bloquais l’entrée

'Cause I've got a hand for you, oh

Yesterday, I saw you standing there
Your head was down, your eyes were red

I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can

See I was wasted, and I was wasting time
'Til I thought about your problems
I thought about your crimes

Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud
I don't wanna be part of your problems
Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no

Hootie & the Blowfish,"Trouble with the world is we're too busy
To think about it, all right
Why is there a rebel flag hanging
From the state house walls
Tired of hearin' this s***
About heritage not hate
Time to make the world a better place

Why must we hate one another
Well, no matter what we gotta live together
Just that you don't look like me
Tell me what do you see
When we pa** on the street
What do you wanna see

P.E.'s coming is all I gotta say
Wanna turn and run away
They're just telling you how they see it
Right or wrong they don't care
You wish that they would quit

Drowning in a sea of tears
Hatred trying to hide your fears
Living only for yourself
Hating everybody else
'Cause they don't look like you

Nancy singing it's a hard life
Wherever you go
About some fat racist living in Chicago
Trying to teach his kids to hate everyone
Well, tell me why is that something
You wanna teach your son

Why must we hate one another
When the people in the church
They tell me you're my brother
You don't walk like me, I said that
You don't talk like me, saying
Go back to Africa
I just don't understand

Drowning in a sea of tears
Hatred trying to hide your fears
Living only for yourself
Hating everybody else
'Cause they don't look like you
Don't look like you

Drowing
I'm trying to be someone
That he could look up to, but
When I walk down the street
Tell me what do you see
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man
No I'm not like you
Why do you hate me so
I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

Drowning",Drowning,1994
Hootie & the Blowfish,"Tomorrow used to be a day away
Now love is gone and you're into someone far away
I never thought the day would come
When I would see his hand not mine
Holding on to yours because I could not find the time
And now I can't deny
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
I don't want to live to see the day you say goodbye

Now there comes another part of life I go alone
Sitting at a bar with Chris that I can't leave
'Cause my house ain't no home
I just want to touch you girl
I want to feel you close to me
Without your love I would give up now and walk away so easily
So maybe while we're young we'll figure out together
That even with the pain there's a remedy
We'll be all right
I don't want to live to see the day you say goodbye

When I first met you I couldn't love anyone
But you stole my dreams and you made me see
That I can walk into the sun and I could still be me
And now I can't deny
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
So baby why break up
Let's figure out together
That even with the pain there's a remedy
And we'll be alright
I don't want to live to see the day you say goodbye
We say goodbye
Oh goodbye
Goodbye",Goodbye,1994
Hootie & the Blowfish,"You got your big girl
Now you've got your young one too
Wondering if some day
I could have them
The way I once had you
I remember your crazy remarks
We'd get drunk and go out after dark
Searching for someone we could take home

You don't wanna be alone
You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door
And see her go
One step and tomorrow comes
Two steps and she's off with someone
Three steps and it's all you know
You'll be gone, she'll be gone

So what are you gonna do about me
I'll be there when you have no one else
Spotted the old man in the south
Hold it in, I'll be there, be your friend

Hold on strong, don't let go
There will never be no one to take your place
So don't you want to reach out and take my hand

You don't wanna be alone
You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door and see her go

Cried myself to sleep that night and I listened
As I heard the angels sing, sha la la

Sha la la la, sha la la la, I'm going home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home

I begged no, no not yet

Look away she said, as she turned to me

I couldn't let her be

Every time I look at you, I go blind.
I don't know what it is.
Something in me just won't give me a chance.
I think it's that I feel more confused
By the deal love has shown me.
Little child, did you know that there's a light,
And it's gonna shine right through your eyes.
What do you think that life is like?
Every time I look at you, I go blind.
I go blind
Well some where over there there's a purpose,
There's a care for free
In me there's no body, no one plan,
No one stand to be free.
I think it's that because I have seen all the fuss
And it's no big deal. No big deal.

Higher than life.",I Go Blind,2000

And I wonder should I offer you a chair? 
Well if you sit down with this old clown,
Take that frown and break it, before the evening's gone away,
I think that we could make it,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
Well the night does funny things inside a man.
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand,
Well I turn around to look at you; you light a cigarette,
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met.
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
I can see that you are lonesome just like me,
And it being late, you'd like some some company.
Well I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split the chair next to you's free.
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.

If you're on everybody's side 
If we can't stop this misery in your name and put our fear aside

You were everywhere it seemed 
You were filling up my soul 
Doin' everything to make me whole 
Read about you in the Sunday paper 
Saw your face on the evening news 
When I woke everything was gone 
And I remembered we were through 
Don't come 'round here no more 

[CHORUS:]
Hey get out of my mind 
Then you tell me we got things to say 
You come around here looking so fine 
Makes it so hard to walk away 
Oh, get out of my head 
Because that look there could leave me dead 
Then you tell me that you love me 

Remember you were the one to leave 
I came back home and I couldn't believe 
I know I would have given anything 
You took it all and you made me think 
Why would she leave me for another man 
What does he have, Lord, that I don't have 
I see you stayin' in his fancy home 
I put on Lauren and I drink alone and say 
Don't come 'round here no more

I'll be there for you 
I remember when I said that I would 
Always love you, too 
I lied 
Don't come around no more

Trying to tell me how to live and just how I should vote

Rode home on my bicycle 
The night was warm and it was June 
Charleston gets so hot so soon 
It reminded me of leaving 

Walked into a crowded room 
Looked around for a place to stand 
Everyone I did not know, and knew 
Reminded me of you 
Reminded me of leaving, this evening 
Reminded me of leaving, 
Reminded me of you 

Stood so near the ocean 
Wearing only your birthday suits 
We were tripping eight miles high 
Shooting stars, your blue disguise 
Reminded me of leaving, this evening 
Reminded me of leaving, just breathing 
Reminded me of leaving...

Into the rich and distant stars 
Bounced me back into your car

Constantly in rotation

A smile finally saved me, found me and repaid me 
For all the time that I've put in 
And now I'm smiling back again

He never got up to check next door

Neighbor scolded I'd upset him
Every time he took off, my thoughts got dark and menacing

I heard the engine and then you lay like a good boy
On the hot summer tar

What those kids thought they saw
Do you really want to remember this?
Today, think of all the alien shots in the dark
That at one time, all at once, coexisted

I mean aside from all the burning
Hurry by the shanties beside the road

Sunset on a cart
Pulled home by a white horse
Conscience of the husband was righteous and coarse
There must be a limit
If we only circle around
There's no hurry in reaching it

Shirt bloodstained
And yet it was not Abel but Cain who got to hear
The voice that for so long had been a stranger
Not one word of all the time they spent growing up brothers
Even love, yes, even love, yes, even lose, something to lose

What if the details there were suddenly shared?
Tender moments siblings keep secret

Sunset on a time when no words could be spared
Unknowing mother rocks soft in her chair

And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'

Yo this is strictly a club record
Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold
When the F-L-E-X was spinnin at the Red Zone, hooded down
And these tired bouncers would not let me in
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, yo, yo
I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector
(Stop drop the Rock's up in here)
Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble
Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles
But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney
and ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi
Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk
The needle ain't skip the record jerked
Cause y'all jumpin' too hard

And you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
And they start it off like this
Electric slide on the dance floor
Freaky-deaky like Studio 54

Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearin' so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?

Looking forward to the day that comes

But it doesn't matter anyway
He can take me where I want to go
Yeah, he's the kind of guy that always seems to know

To give up my freedom
Tell my ex to stop calling, admit that I'm falling

Counting stars in the pale moonlight
It's a feeling that I can't explain
'Cause no other lover's ever made me feel the same

He's the kind of guy you can't compare
To anybody else out there
And when I blow him a little kiss
He makes me forget about all the guys I'll miss

Yup, just a normal day, on my favorite website, backpage.com
I was scrollin' through hoes, lookin' for a bitch to fuck
I’m like, “That babe, uh huh.”
I was just about to call her
Then I saw an ad pop up, I'm like, ""Wait, oh my God!""
You see, I had a really long day
And I just could not turn down an Asian massage
So, I called ‘em up and I said
“Hello, when is your next slot available?”
She said, “You can come right now.”
Fuck yeah! “Hurry up, because I’ll wait for you!”
I pulled up and I sat in the waiting room
Is this shit all a set up, it's debatable
If I get confronted by the police
I just want a massage, I am not here to break the rules
Then an Asian lady had a pen and told me
“Come over here to the counter!”
Then she ask me if I wanted to get a session
For 30 minutes or an hour
I said, ""Hmm uh, I'll take 30
Nah, matter of fact I’ll do an hour, fuck it.""
'Cause I know, whatever's 'bout to go on
Behind those doors I’m 'bout to love it
She say, “Usually 50 dollar but for you I do 45.”
I say thank you and gave her the money
Then she say, “Okay, let's go inside!”
I'm like, ""Fuck yeah!"" It's about to go down right now
So good what I found right now
I’m about to let it all out right now, yeah

Look, so I walked back in to the massage room
She said, “Take your clothes off, and then put this robe on!”
I’m like, ""Okay, no prob'.""
Oh God, this about to be so fun
And no one even knows, she left, I got undressed
And all the sudden a new Asian girl walked through the door
She said, ""Hello, how are you?
I am Muli, that's what you can call me
And I give you lovely Asian massage.""
I’ve been waitin' for this all day
I position myself on the table
And put my face down in the circular cushion
And she started massagin' my back
I knew somethin' was up with the way she was lookin'
Then she slid her tiny little finger tips
Down my spine right over my buttcrack
She was massagin' my booty
Then dove in my thighs and start touchin' my nutsack
Fuck yeah!
Then I put a little bitty sway in my hips to let her know I like it
Somethin' was 'bout to go down
You can see it a mile away, you don't have to be psychic
She said, ""You want someting?”
I said, “Yes I do.”
She said, “You big strong man, I really like you!”
I said, “I like you too.”
Then she said, “You want the hand, sucky, fucky?
Tell me right now 'cause I need to know!”
I said “I’ll have all three of those”
Then I thought ooh she a little freaky ho
She said, “I give it to you for cheap, you give me 125 dollar”
I said, “Okay, here you go!”
Lowkey I was feelin' kinda awkward
She jacked me off and gave me my top first
I stayed quiet as I watched her
My dick had a strong posture
She said, “You very big like a monster!”
She got naked then I humped her
I’m lovin' this little tiny Asian booty, I swear that this feelings the best
I’m buildin' a sweat, I’m killin' it yes
I pulled out and spilled on her breast
Everything was just right
I hit the hour on the deadline
I guess I’m gonna leave now
She said, “That's fine, thank you, come again next time!”

She thinks to herself, ""Hmm, I know what I should do
I'ma call Nicole up and tell her all the good news""
It went to voice mail 'cause Nicole was sleeping
So Lauren left a message, like ""Girl, I'm gonna see him""
She hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling
Looking at the ceiling, daydreaming in dead silence
Eventually her daydreaming turns into sleep
It's love that she's feeling and yes the feeling is sweet

But it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things""
She says ""That's fine, I'll see you at twelve
Until then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well""
She takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff
Make-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up

She pulls up but Pete hasn't arrived yet
Should she go in without him, she hasn't decided
She doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it
So she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids
It's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite
She decides to go inside without him and have a bite
Then her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it
Pete says ""Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it""
Lauren says ""Why? What happened? What is it?""
Then Pete says ""I just heard my grandmother's real sick
And I have to go and give her a visit""
Then Lauren says ""It's okay baby, go handle your business""
She loves him too much so it didn't really bother her
She hops in the car pulls off, a truck follows her
But she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud
And she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album
Now she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out
Soon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down
She drops her keys, the man picks 'em up
Then drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck
He slapped her, then put tape on her mouth
To take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud
He's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick
Then he yells out ""Bitch, Pete never existed!""
Her head's spinning, then she just faints
The man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped
From that day on nobody ever heard from her
'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her
He tossed her body in a off-road ditch
He said to her ""See you at the crossroad, bitch""

Hopsin,"I see you

I see you looking at me
Looking at me, so I ask

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

You're crazy,
I like you, but you're crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to whom bathe me
Never know that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades, rev x steady they couldn't endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with her cigarette
In the same spot ten times in a row
When I felt that burn upon the clitoris?
I'ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away,
I feel stupid 'cause I ain't did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts,
I get vexed but I ain't bit her neck
Open, I try to contain it but that damn dame thang's soakin'
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange lane hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain't nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I'm suffering, I'm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin' hollerin' my god,
Afterwards I like really hots scolding water on my balls

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Mom? Dad? I'm no longer the boy you're used to seeing
I've changed a lot, plus I've grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I'm doing things I don't normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would of put down the mic and say
Fuck it I'll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain,
I could probably jump without your name
No lovey-dovey let's ignite the flame
If you're lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain't very marry to say,
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute,
I'm stressin' the game if I go to hell,
Then heavens to blame
I don't mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think that I'm hella deranged (hey)
When I was seven years old,
I fell on my head and I severed my brain (hey)
If you think I'm lying then
Ask my mama nigga she'll can tell you the same
Should I be ashamed?
No, I'm living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent outta a shape my nigga let me ask you this

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

I stab you with this mic
And rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter fact I'm rapping through you,
Never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Can't even see you niggas,
Y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion
To use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes
Is just like old fashion voodoo
Y'all ain't even the shit,
No y'all ain't even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my toobos
So I'm slapping you foolish
With wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic
But it's more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I'm all up out of my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here,
Give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I could peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma fill it crack when I hit it,
Then I'ma spill it back when you heal it
Damn it Bobby boy, what in the hell,
What in the heaven, what in the earth
Where is your mom? What are you cursed?
Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where were you first?
Why weren't you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt?
Man I think that you're going berserk

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Am I a psycho? (psycho)
Am I a psycho? (psycho)
Yeah I'm a psycho (psycho)

Hopsin,"You think you original? You ain't original
You were programmed to be you
You're a slave and you don't even know it
The shit you think of ain't even your thoughts
Let's step out the box for a minute

How do we know if God exists?
How do we know what's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit
To stealing it, but if the tables turned then you would pocket it
See I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look you'll see I'm nothing like an angry crook
I'm learning hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's in the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become something so unique where I'm from

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Obama's president, so? What's he represent?
Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charm and smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus
And all you fools believe it
The change he's making isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealing with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason real shit happens, and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour than have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack one's get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

We're all smart and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fucking powerhouse, but what? That wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that ""should've, could've, would've"" stuff
You probably threw your life away cause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Saying ""I should've did this"" or ""I shouldn't have hung with this guy""
""I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized""
I ain't being cruel, these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off a lot for time to rest
You bullshittin' till your life is gone
'Cause living's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

I severe the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree

I'm fuckin' dope and this is my reward

Hopsin,"Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starving for like six days
I should go and get a switch blade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain
Slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, 
Bitch I'am not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible 
That I could blow and get a little money 
From selling records for copping clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close

Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal

Yo, since when are buddies posed to be so mean
There must be hate in the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics 
And in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talking bout I've been erect, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggas rest
You hating cause you witnessing the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up move on
You've taken this shit too far

You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together
It's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold to
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you

So I keep my distance, cause you always got this blank expression
Like you’re confused and unaware of your surroundings
Emotions have gone and no one’s found it, it’s overwhelming
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass, now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world 'cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to (Like we used to)
(Where’d you go?)
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future
But I was wrong

I should've stopped you when I had the chance to do so
But back then I had felt like that was too bold
You started hanging with new folks, and made the drug environment your new home
This world is too cold, could I have prevented this? Who knows?
They convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do
Saying it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible
So you started skipping school, hanging with these wicked dudes
Unaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool
And it’s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?
In they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house
Back when you met them I had doubts, they put you on the bad route
And when you needed they help to pick you up, they fucking backed out
They fucking got you, I can’t lie
But now your brain's fried, and you don’t even act like you’re the same guy
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain’t listen 'til the fire burned your ass, now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world 'cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to (Like we used to)
(Where’d you go?)
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future
But I was wrong

I ain’t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore
I reminisce on us playing Nintendo 64
And that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards
And we was doing ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor
Shit changed and it happened quick
But I can’t forget that you was the first homie I started rapping with
You could’ve had half of this back when I had established it
But now I have to sit and feel bad, look what your actions did
Man you were so outgoing and so hysterical
Seeing you now is just unbearable, it’s terrible
You should've made your choices wisely, fucking with poison ivy,
Without your brain please tell me what would your point in life be?
It’s a struggle to get your ass to listen
You really hurt me and the rest of your family with all your bad decisions
We always told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass, now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world 'cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to (Like we used to)

Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Taking some notes and then I write the song
I'm staring down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fucking me up
And I cried upon while asking you for some answers
But we don't have that type of bond
Now my desires gone with the way that I've been living lately
If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
'Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out
Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feeling so damn humiliated 'cause they looking at me like I'm hellbound
What story should I tell now? I'll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are You? You never showed the proof
And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do?
There's way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted
These ain't wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I been itching to get it, I've been given assistance
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer and humans can't provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it
Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Where's the Holy Ghost at? How long it take Man to find it?
My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it
You gave me a bible and expect me not to analyze it
I'm frustrated and you provoked it
I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
I have a fucking brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lying with such an inaccurate source
It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah's witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinkin' that Pac's alive
I ain't trying to take your legacy and torch it down
I'm just saying, I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist
Show yourself and the boom is done
Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you're the one
I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop onto of a roof to plunge
I'll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven't been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain't seen no talking snake or rabbit from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don't know if you do or don't exist, shit is driving me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to you so don't forget
If hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I'mma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feeling says it's all fake, I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
This isn't a small phase, my perspective's all changed
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you aren't real then all my prayers aren't worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could just sit in the church and say fuck in the services
Man what if Jesus was a facade? Then that would mean the government's God
I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot
So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box
Man everything is what if, why is it always what if
Planet Earth what if, the universe what if
My sacrifice what if, my afterlife what if
Every fucking thing that deals with you is fucking suspect
I'm fucking done, I'm fucking done
This is my fucking life and I'm living it, I'm having fun
If you really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed
We are you, and you're us, stop playing games
My life's all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I am in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain

First of all, the best type of marketing is marketing that doesn't feel like marketing
It makes the people feel like they a part of it

It's why players are good at getting chicks
It's why Nike is good at selling kicks
It's why Disney is loved by all the kids
Why McDonald's owners are super rich, we too blinded to ever see 'em pitch
See when this happens we take our health, wealth, lives and just hand them off
Thinking that we did this from organic thoughts
I know you seen parents trick kids with candy, toys, and Santa Claus
The same method is used to trap adults
But instead of candy it's with money, religion, drugs and alcohol

Knowing we need the cash for rent

Any struggle, I'mma body ya *blaow* (c'mon)
Don't you ever try to copy my style
Little nigga, ain't no jockin' allowed
I pop out the blue like a Crip with a rag
I got the juice, watch you listen to Chance
I'm in the booth on a mission to smash
Pocket the loot, I be gettin' this cash
Hop is the truth that's why niggas is mad
I came to bruise with a pen and a pad
As of lately, I've been itching to smash
So here is my ass, you can kiss in advance

Niggas wishin' I fell o-o-off
But I'm forever ill, that's by law
These commercial niggas keep jockin', killing's my only option
Ask about me boy, I get shit popping
(Yeah, yeah, Pound Syndrome)

There is no limit to my madness
I'mma smash it, smash it, smash it

Movin' on to the second segment
I spit shit like I got chest congestions
You shoulda known to never neglect the reckless
Time to myself was the best suggestion
Sex before bed and sex for breakfast
The sound that you're hearin' is the stress digested
You ever tell me, a little less aggression
You'd better get ghost 'fore your head get pressed in (back up)
You rap niggas just a facade
You only do ten-percent of your job
Your producer is the only reason that they bumpin' your shit while they sit up and nod
Who the fuck you think you kiddin' bro?
You think you're fly because you gettin' dough?
If your label would stop paying radio stations to play you
You think we would feel it? No
That's just how it goes
Please do not get close, this is not a joke
Better be jottin' notes of my hottest quotes
Till your pockets swole, puto vámonos (ay wey!)
Shit I'm just talkin', don't mind me
I guess it's my comical mind state
The moment I came into the game
I've been gettin' fame, I've been the hottest since MySpace
I ain't even gotta try to amaze ya
Mind been missing like a flight from Malaysia
That I can do when it lies in my nature
These are the bullshit rhymes I get paid from
Yup, I done made a career
Most niggas think my situation is weird
But don't get it twisted, I know what I'm doing
I've been had it locked, I'm just making it clear

Hopsin,"Yeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour
I was mad about it, I half-assed my album cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for
I was going through a break up and that was hard
I wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure
Every night I was praying and I would ask the Lord
To please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans
But no luck I was stuck
Even though a nigga had a plus size buzz
I didn't even know who the fuck I was
I tried so hard to see a plus side, but
I couldn't find the spark inside the dark
Even with my crew saying nice remarks
It felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart
I was thinking that a brand new life's the start
But I couldn't leave, I made a commitment
On my off time the fans invaded my business
So I started feeling a gang of resentment
Flipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit
I needed to go home and gather my thoughts
I didn't wanna suicide as the result
So the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage
I left through the back for a walk and no one saw
I thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'
And a voice had told me to keep walking
And do not step foot on that stage for nothing
So I kept on walking
Then I camped out up in an abandoned house
I hated this rap shit and I hated my life
The spotlight does that when you can't get out

Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

I got a girl back home, yeah
God know she the sweetest thing on earth
I can't sleep on her
But there's too many women on tour and I try not to cheat on her
Man, my options for pussy are unrealistic
There's bitches who'd give up a lung for this dick
My music be leaving 'em sprung and twisted
The average nigga would have fun with this shit, that's real
Here is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I
Upcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive

But you know that shit when you rise
And by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies
No, I'm not gon' say that you wrong
But I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet
When all I do is hold you down
If I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now
I know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out
You done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls
You don't wanna deal with it
But I'm looking at these fans like damn there's a lot of y'all
You got me tripping with the bodyguard
Like ""Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?""
Now I don't care that you left the show
I just wish you woulda let me know
Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped
Or know somebody from the city where they live at
But, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad
Honestly it made a nigga real mad
Cause I'm texting you like Hop the devil just testing you
When Fort Collins got respect for you
And that's why the next day, you was like

Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat

Niggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder
Now they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)

We learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us
They know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere
Yeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris
Back in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode
Reppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope
We've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle
So we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown
SwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us
We're guaranteed to make a win
I said I'm in, let the games begin
So he introduced us, then after that
We plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah

You see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief
Made an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit
I figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen
And tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas
Then I blew up way faster than what I had predicted
It's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image
Some people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position
But I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it
2011, went on a nation wide tour
Came back and dropped that Ill Mind 4
That put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days
I celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid
I shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B
I went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?
2012, I made the XXL Freshman list
I knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it
Come on, man

I was online chillin', bloggin' and what not (okay)
I stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)
I asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, ""Come on Hop
I been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.""
If he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked
He said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot
We flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?
He said, ""Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.""
A few months later, one of the homies had stopped me
Asked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast
I said, ""probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?""
He showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!
I'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz
And Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!
We had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up
Now we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts

Yo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life
Romp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic
I tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA
While I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way
Junior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream
Calculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme
Hop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene
Dame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team
F-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga
Seven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger
And we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture
Dizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver
So I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed
Meet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face
Independent livin', we control every decision made
What up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!

You ever dated a woman that held you back?
She ain't making no moves, you like, yo where the hell you at?
Life is valuable girl, I shouldn't have to tell you that
Cause you grew up with some bums who knew nothing but selling crack
She'll tell you that she'll do better and convince you
You move her in with you to fix the issues, you assuming it's gonna be simple
But shit didn't change, now there's something deadlier emerging
And her situation just became a heavier burden
Now your life is more than crazy, you fighting on the daily
Man it's time for her to go, you done decided, no debating
Cause there ain't no light shining on the future
She wasted all my time and all my mula
And she ain't even grateful for the cheddar I blew

I'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need
The choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?
You mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see
You know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity
To get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame
You been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank
You be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay
Abusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay
Why don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it
Our foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments
So create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it
I'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience

Let me tell y'all why I get a different feeling
Y'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in
I don't recall any help or sympathies
Since 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?
Could have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand
But y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan
Focused on yourself, and now you holding on for help
You were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell
Oh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal
You want the benefits without playing the courses on the field
You ain't even doing your best or trying
Don't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying
Just know that when your bright days going straight
I couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know

Money can leave you isolated cause people are shady
So why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it
To get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways
Even taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken
Foes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted
Around them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships
Don't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit
Mooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just
Not the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em
That is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in

Sisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em
That's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries

Look, Z to the third, I prefer to observe
Been on the sideline for a minute, now I'm 'bout to emerge
Separated myself from losers tryna take what I earn
Put my faith in this music knowing nothing's easy deserved, I got racks baby
You haven't noticed, I've been working on these tracks lately
Stacking this ammo just in case these niggas act crazy

His head inside a duffel bag that's in back of my Dodge
Mr. Benton, ho, I refuse to be pigeon, ho, with these imbeciles
A space ace that's been on, bitch, I been gone
I finger these hoes till I get carpal tunnel syndrome
I rap like I don't wanna go back in that basement
Cook up murder material, get blood on my apron
You don't want no problems, what the brass knuckle done
I'm a bully, I don't care to watch these fags guzzle cum
Gat with the bracket that the strap buckle on
Dr. Lecter in this bitch with that black muzzle on
Fuck the industry! Chip on my shoulder, bitch, remember me?
I'm 'bout to murder all my enemies, Hail Mary!

Sorry if I come off conceited
I'm dropping killer bars till you niggas all deleted

I'm holdin' on grenades and I'm tryin' to not pull a pin
I done contemplated on downin' a bottle of gin
'Cause maybe that'll calm my nerves and get my ass on track
I'm on the fuckin' edge, I snapped and I just can't go back
I have no class, I'm cut from how my last ho act
She tried to ruin me, she damn near made my cash flow crash
I fuckin' hate this bitch, her name could sit on a grave
Only reason she ain't dead is 'cause my kid on the way
The bitch is pregnant and she strippin', dodgin' minimum wage
She done kick me down, locked me up and spit on my face
I bought a ring for this bitch just to set it in stone

Shit, you ain't got much to lose
Anyone can hold a gun up, but who's brave enough to shoot?
You know damn well he's addicted to rakin' up the loot

It's why your fuckin' son admires me, come and fire me

You motherfuckers keep forgettin' I'm too good at my job
Y'all shoulda knew this, some think I'm too retarded and stupid

I'm only wearing this goddamn suit because you put me through all this court bullshit, man

Look, I honestly didn't know they were gonna do this
I thought they were just gonna write you up

Write me up? What the fuck is this, middle school?! 
You're a fucking white girl telling the police a black man beat you in the fucking hotel room! 
You're fucking with my life. You know damn well I didn't hurt you

Well I was scared and you were holding me hostage 
And I didn't know if you were gonna kill me and my baby

What?! Kill the baby?! Holding you hostage?! 
What the fuck are you talking about?! 
Who do you think I am?! You think I'm a terrorist?! 
How did you not think this through?!

I got her the engagement ring that she liked, booked a new flight
To come to Sydney, just to see her, start a new life
Man, she's 20 weeks pregnant and I was tryin' do right
For us, the family, the kid, but maybe I was too nice
My homie text me a picture and I just burst into anger
It was my girl in a bed with her personal trainer
I text my homie like, ""Yo, where you find this?""
He says, ""Snapchat, bro, it's all on my timeline, shit""
Swear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest
I looked at my girl and said, ""Get a paternity test!""
She said, ""NO! Don't you get all worked and upset
I only slept in his bed right after work just to rest""
I said, ""What? You expect me to believe that?
Ha, alright, yeah I'll 'relax'
Guess it doesn't seem bad
My girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged""
Officer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached
I said, ""Bitch, I can't believe this shit!
Does he know you're pregnant? Is that his kid?
Look how big my headache is!
This whole time y'all havin' sex and shit
What type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick?!
I said, ""Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kiddin', bitch!""
She said, ""No, I'm not gettin' it!""
Officer, I ain't seen her in months, I couldn't trust the lyin' whore
Plus she told me she slept with this guy before
And then I said, you know what? Forget it, it's all good, nevermind
Shit was makin' my blood pressure high
I love her unconditionally, you know, I can't pretend I ain't never lie
For the moment, I guess I'll let it slide
She said, ""If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus, then say so""
I said, ""Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go
How you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough""
She said, ""Hahaha, I make loads""
She had six grand cash
I said, ""But you was broke two weeks ago!
How you makin' chips that fast?""
She said, ""I bartend, I made it all in tips, ha ha""
I said, ""Girl, you must take me as a big jackass""
I'm like, ""Please, we both know money is hard to come by""
Her bullshit might fly over the heads of some guys
Officer, she's always tellin' dumb lies
I've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time!
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""I bartend, duh, from tips I'm a waitress""
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She started stutterin' like, ""Uhm-uhh-mmm, Marcus, wait just""
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""Ok, ok, I'll tell you, just promise me you won't get mad""
I'm like, ""Baby, where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""I work at a strip club… it's how I made the six grand""
I said, ""Woaah, no no!""
I fell down in tears, my heart broke, I turned cold
I don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' ho shit
If she needed cash I woulda loaned it, and she knows it
They won't let me get a refund on this $20,000 ring
Fuck, my head hurts, I need some ibuprofen

Yeah, Mr. Hopson, you need a minute?
Um, may I have some water please?
Ah, no worries at all
I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me
Yeah, it's alright, you're good…yeah here ya go, mate!
Thanks 

I wasn't me no more
I looked her in the eyes and straight told her
(What'd you say to her?)
I need you to tell me where this strip club is at
Or this family we're about to have is over
I said, ""Tell me where it's at!"" — she said, ""No""
I said, ""You about to make me mad!"" she said, ""So?""
I said ""Bitch, you better panic and run, the damage is done
You're doin' this four months away from havin' my son!
I told her I would always have her back
I forgave her after all the careless acts
I have one question, and she couldn't share the facts
The strip club — how come she couldn't tell me where it's at?
Who the fuck she fuckin' in there?
Whose dick she suckin' in there?
Shakin' her fuckin' butt in the air
It's like we've argued for a thousand fuckin' hours, I'm annoyed
And I was at the point where somethin' was 'bout to get destroyed
I grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room
I fuckin' launched it too
It was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels
I blacked out; she said, ""What the fuck is wrong with you?""
She got up out the bed to get it, I pushed her ass back in it
I said, ""We're still talkin', bitch, you and I ain't finished
Now, this strip club, where is it? BITCH, WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?!""
I said, ""You know what? fuck it, awesome, fine""
In the process of all this drama, I had lost my mind
I felt lost and blind: the gym trainer, the strip club
The ring, the baby, she really crossed the line
And then I finally came down and all the madness was finished
Then she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith
I said, ""I ain't goin' with you, you can leave now
I need to stay in this hotel room and figure some things out""
Officer, I know you ain't gonna sympathize
I don't approve of any man puttin' hands on his girlfriend or wife
Especially when she's pregnant with his kid inside
Honestly feel like I wasn't in the wrong, but still I wasn't in the right
Ask her, she ain't got no bruises on her
I'm human, there's only so much that a dude can conquer
She knew that her actions reflected true dishonor
And tried to cover it, sayin' I'm an abusive monster
That's bullshit, huh, and that fast, poof
All of her wrongs are in the past, cool
She's just the innocent white girl
And I'm the black guy who always gets mad, true!
I know y'all about to make it hard for me to get back into Australia

She looks like the Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters
Oh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is
But that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks
The humps on Mom's chest are not real, they're elastic
And if you look closely you can see she's made of plastic
Like a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend
I promise we gon' be together somehow in the end
I am very ashamed that you don't have my last name
Every night I go to bed and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
You know what time it is, son

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (that's right)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (Daddy doesn't fuck with who?) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

Currently my life has hit the floor
I can't lie to you, shit is hard
I should be buildin' with the Lord
It could be what I'm missin' or
Maybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more
Just to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore
When I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars
This was on my vision and you were the one I did it for
My relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue
After all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort
Our lives are so unhappy
'Cause this world is cold and nasty
Just know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family
I'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived
Buut now you have to suffer
'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives
You're way too young to notice it
You don't deserve to go through this
If I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch
At least then I'll feel like my bannin' was justified
Look at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Where's my choir at?

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (Momma had to fuck it all up)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(Daddy doesn't fuck your momma) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

Oh, son
I'm sorry I can't be there with you
But I'll be there soon
But Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (no, no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Just know that

Our lives coulda been so good

Shootin' pellet guns at cars until we saw the coppers
Once we got confronted we would lie and say it's not us, gotcha

I'm like, Seagal with the steel but ""Harder to Kill""

Waited years to get a premier and did it from here

Other niggaz shoe tops, only youth on the block
You dig me - movin in tops and movin these rocks

Eight-three I did me, eight-four I had grew
Eighty-five it got live, eight-six in the mix

Eighty-nine I had the grind, now I know it was flow
Ninety-one we got guns, ninety-two it was dough
Nine-three was the key, nine-four was sure

I am born again
In the neon sign, scrolling up and down

In an interstellar burst

I am born again
In a fast German car, I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

The candle it burns

The meaning it dies

They shadow box and they paper chase
It never stops
And we'll never learn
No hope without dope

The bankers have bailed
The mighty retreat
The pleasure it fails
At the end of the week
You take it or leave

In little clicks you got the music stops
The needle sticks and the penny drops
The summer's gone before you know
The muffled drums of relentless flow
You're looking at stars that give you Vertigo
The sun's still burning and dust will blow
Honey scars I'll keep you near
Our blood is gold nothing to fear
We killed the time and I love you dear

I was giving this a lot of thought
Should I trip? Should I not? Should I set this off?
A whole lotta pressure is on my shoulders
My soul is with all my niggaz I roll with; so know this
Cut the bullshit, take it back to the music
use it right, don't matter what you do with it
I'm here to represent the real
I still stayed G'ed up unless must I will
I stayed up all night, I argue and fight by myself; this can't be right
Hmm 'cause if the lights were the sound of the siren
I'd make you niggaz get a deal and act wild
I'm for real and I can see through these suckers that dick riding motherfuckers
Yeah, that's me bustin' 'cause I'm a huslter for the chips
And I'm trippin 'cause I'm sick of this shit

I can't get a job; I might as well steal and rob
Man, life is so hard
Hanging in my homie garage while other niggaz
doing killing for a living in the city of stars
I got a lick but I ain't got caught
Nigga slippin' leaving a sack by the bar
And I seen where he set it, thought he had hid it
Nope, and I'm about to go get it

I'd be frontin,' reminisicin' where your nigga at?
Ain't nuthin,' never thought about the hot outfits, jewelry or the celly
Back then we was in the skelly
Shorties with the barrettes, candy in the bag
The handgun, remember when we shot the fair one?

For a nickel got my squeeze on

We runnin' from school security, besides that the 102 cops

And why this trouble follow me every fuckin' where?

OK, now we graduated from junior high
We into badder bitches, caine, getting money yo, we livin? fly
We got the Jordan and ball, we got the weed and all

Horace Heidt,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

Ah yes, I was wrong
Again
I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough-ful of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain

Stifling those who strive

And there I'll be while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1997

A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1960
