James Kirkland,"Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
I missed me how I missed me at your house last night

Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands",I Missed Me [#],1987
James Kirkland,"I walked by the river
Where we said goodbye,
Thought of your kisses,
And didn't even cry
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better

I talked with an old friend,
He asked about you
I managed to tell him
With just a tear or two
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better

I know I'll never be the same
I was standin' too close to the flame
But it doesn't hurt so much
To hear your name
I think I'll make it, I'm gettin' better",I'm Getting Better [#],1987
James Kohono,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1998
James L. Dean,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2005
James L. Dean,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2005
James L. Dean,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2005
James L. Venable,"It's magic you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic you know
Never believe it's not so

Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Lazy day in bed music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

It's magic you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic you know
Never believe it's not so

I love my sunny day
Dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

It's magic you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic you know

Never believe it's not so

James LaBrie,"Well you're just seventeen - all you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space
Between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nu nu nothin'
Hey hey hey hey, it was the D.N.A.
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?

Real cardiac

I feel so inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar - ticulate

Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like a paralyse

Turn on the T.V. let it drip right down in your eyes

James LaBrie,"A thousand years of sleep
I've missed the rising sun
Wish I could change this
Always the same
With each one, every night
I'd watch as the light
Slowly fades from their eyes

Oh so long
Long ago
What he took
Then gave to me
There is no end
It's not what I thought it'd be

Left drained felt impaired
The eyes drew me inside
Hypnotic waltz from his stare
Letting go

Oh I still love
With the night will arrive
The cobblestones
Light misty air
The brief caress
Our sweet affair

Oh so long
Long ago
I was just like any of you
A Simple Man
There was nothing I could do

But I've grown so tired
There's no need to hold on
If you hear me
Just wanna be
Be the man I was

Please believe
If I could
I would change
One thousand years
And still I am
Looking like the day
This all began

Oh so long
Long ago
What he took
Then gave to me
Take it back
And give back the man in me

I'm going on my way
I'm going where there's no desire
Goin' on where I'll stay higher than now

I want what you have taken
My life has been forsaken
Many nights I lay torn I'm breaking down
Why all this began
What's there to care for
Fade away",A Simple Man,2001
James LaBrie,"Father watch me fall
Witness my mistakes
I have lost it all
I'm about to break

Before the sound of dawn
I turned my back on you
The life in me was gone
My consciousness withdrew

Fear
Tormenting me
Guilt
Won't let me be

I chose a different way
But there's nowhere I could hide
From one end of the world
To the other side

I've never felt as cold
As I do today
There's nothing here to hold
No reason I should stay

Crucify
Resist, deny
Kill the pain that dwells inside
Send your word
From on high
So this part of me will die

Can you hear my thoughts
I know what I have done
You are all I've got
And I don't want to run

Surrender to your will
From the ashes I am new
Your presence is revealed
Showing all that's true

Fear
Tormenting me
Guilt
Won't let me be

Crucify
Resist, deny
Kill the pain that dwells inside
Send your word
From on high
So this part of me will die

James LaBrie,"The air's so thick
It blurs my vision
I can't think straight
In this condition
This dim lit hall
Is stretching further
Not knowing
What I might discover

Through a door half open
A painted light bulb swings
Casting someone's shadow
Reaching towards me

Something draws me here
Not sure
Feeling Drained
Still I am curious
Haunts me
Taunts me
Now I start to Gravitate

Remain composed
I hear some laughter
The darkness in me
Moving faster
A handle turned
A door is opened
Ashtrays
Cigarettes still smoking

And there again before me
The painted light bulb swings
And see I cast the shadow
The one I saw moving

Cannot catch my breath
Can't cope
His face turns toward me
Can't be
Not me
The man in the mirror

It's all too clear
As I stood there
Acknowledged him
In reflective glare

I don't quite understand
Why any of this
Is who I am
I'm damned cause I doubt
It's part of me
Trick of the mind
Pschitso you see

It's like awakening
I'm in
Someone else's skin
Molds me
Holds me
Controlled
Left me Drained and empty

Transformed
Shifting
I peer inside
Like quicksand
You pulled me
Down deeper
All twisted inside of me",Drained,2005
James LaBrie,"Know how it came to this
The hit on me his kiss
Stripped of all dignity 
The Man

I set him up 
He brought me in
Portrayed the goon to trust 
Befriend
Fed the machine 
And lived the lie
Concealed the truth to stay alive

Two faced 
Can't trace
Convinced what they see

Thick skinned

This plan had better work
Their tapped I'm wired research
No swear I'll blend right in 
Right in

Knock em dead
Hesitate it's me instead

Lose my nerve

To blow their cover
To end what's happening

Keep talking this way
Got something to say
Information you want more
Just gotta even the score

Which side's gonna save you
Which side's gonna play you

I lie, I breathe the air they feed me
Would welcome smothering

James LaBrie,"Look in the mirror
Does it look familiar
Cannot put my finger
Why he kinda looks like me

Used to like hooking up with you
After waking first thing I'd do
One sided sensation
Watching me watching you

Now I'm stuck how I feel
I don't know if it's real
I'm trying to find someone
Who's invisible

Now I'm stuck in the middle
My life is the riddle
Trying to find someone
Who's invisible

No way
I cannot lie
I haven't felt right
And I don't know why
Drowning
No coming up for air
And part of me
Just wants to be left there

Living a constant lie
How much longer
I'd rather die
So bitter
Tongue twisted
Has me paralyzed

They claim they know me
Who I'm supposed to be
A quick fix sure remedy
Another needly plunges deep

Now I'm stuck how I feel
I don't know if it's real

James LaBrie,"Sometime after five
I don't know what I've done
But I put my car in drive
And I'm blinded by the sun

In my rearview mirror
The colors start to fade
My past just disappears
And I am so afraid

I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost

Thought I saw the sign
Perhaps I should have turned
I really see just fine
Guess I'm not concerned

Maybe I'll forget
The way things were before
It's too late for regrets
Cause I've opened up the door

Her arrogance a sure foot in
Could blow her cover
If I warned them
Letting them know
She's not who she pretends

A relentless force

That kept on playing over
I sway back and forth

Oblivious I seem

Commitment, have many nice things

Contrived rhetoric speech

Rank and file members
Fearing change

James Last,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,1969

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Als ich durch Vorstadtstraßen heimwärts ging
Da war ein Wirtshaus
Aus dem das Licht noch auf den Gehsteig schien

Da saßen Männer mit braunen
Augen und mit schwarzem Haar
Und aus der Jukebox erklang Musik

Stand einer auf und lud mich ein

Und dann erzählten sie mir von grünen Hügeln, Meer und Wind
Von alten Häusern und jungen Frauen, die alleine sind
Und von dem Kind das seinen Vater noch nie sah

Irgendwann geht es zurück
Und das Ersparte genügt zu
Hause für ein kleines Glück

I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,

She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down

With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one

She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?

Take a sad song and make it better

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do

James Last,"I don't know how to love him.
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,

I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.

I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.

I want him so.

Cuando tu estas ausente yo espero
Es tu religión o quizás realidad

Esperarte si desfallecer

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled 

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on a treadmill
And they made you change your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid 

Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
Well I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Though I never knew you at all

James Last,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Never mind what you think that you had seen
It all can change in just a moment
Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe,2001

Why should my lips be concealing

Lady of Spain, I love you

Spanish moon makes silver splendor

James Last,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2001

Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees

And the old men playing checkers by the trees

For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me

I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers and the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the love of my life

James Last,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

where is your heart?

All those years drifting in space
I have known you well, yet I've never seen your face
You turn around, looking at me, laughter in your eyes

And the cold, cold wind, it blows me away
The feeling all over is a black black day
But I know that I'll see you again

'Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me?'

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice

Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
Cause she didn't fit in there

James Last,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow-capped mountains white

And it echoes through the land

And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for
From a distance there is harmony

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy

Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters

Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me

And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down

James Last,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sounds of Silence,2006

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still

If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon

When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd

I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone

I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone

Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time

Living love between the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone

Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone

And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came (sha la) so far (so far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine

And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

So I'll play I'll wait
And I'll pray it's not too late
We can so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of site

Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change

Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev'rything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise

I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it

I'm out of my mind but I'm falling in love
I'm going to take that tiger outside for a ride

What a life
What a life

Keep on chasing down that rainbow
You'll never know what you might find
Over the sunset on the horizon
It may be a dream but it tastes like poison
I'm going to take that tiger outside for a ride

What a life

Some say you might lose your mind",AKA… What a Life! [UNKLE Rework],2015

An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

James MacKintosh,"With a crime of passion lie those dreams of yesterday 
Broken like the snows of January 
Silence will fall on those masters of shame 
When the family garden wakes to spring again 
 
Under the moon and over land 
Make the shadows of the chosen one 
With words of mercy in his hand 
He walks the path of peace a wounded man 
 
Out of sight and out of mind 
The devil`s staircase winding high 
Make it secret make it sudden 
And the family garden wakes to frosty ground 
 
In Europe's towns tonight 
They lie awake again to fear the dawn 
An endless story of empty glory 
 
Days of love are hard to find 
One man`s rose is another`s thorn 
But the winds of change they write the tune 
And the family garden wakes to song again",Crime of Passion,1995
James MacKintosh,"Water lapping round my knees 
Golden sand beneath my feet 
Would mean a lot to me 
There`s very little you can say 
To make those feelings go away 
Till you take me 
 
There`s nothing more that I prefer 
To see the boys and the girls 
Step it out with grace and pride 
As honesty flows by your side 
 
I cannot run from times hard pressed 
To become embittered, dispossessed 
Just like some do 
And maybe some place I can find 
Where wheel and heart become entwined 
Like I hope to 
 
And nothing matters more to you 
To sit and sing a song that`s true 
The first one there and last to leave 
Sweet memories for you to keep 
 
No easy lesson for me to learn 
Just to close those eyes of mock concern 
And halt your rush to be sincere 
There`s more in life for you to fear",Grace and Pride,1995

Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2014

Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America

“Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more

Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time

And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust

That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered

Too many years ago
You can make me feel
Like it isn't so

Why you come to be with me
I think I finally know
You're scared, ashamed of what you feel
You can't tell the ones you love

You know they couldn't deal
Whisper in a dead man's ear
Doesn't make it real
That's great, but I don't want to play

Being with you touches me more than I can say
Since I'm only dead to you
I'm saying stay away
And let me rest in peace

Let me rest in peace
Let me get some sleep
Let me take my love and bury it
In a hole 6 foot deep

I lay my body down
But I can't find my sweet release
Let me rest in peace
You know you got a willing slave

And you just love to play the thought
That you might misbehave
But till you do, I'm telling you
Stop visiting my grave

And let me rest in peace
I know I should go
But I follow you like a man possessed
There's a traitor here beneath my breast

And it hurts me more than you've ever guessed
If my heart could beat it would break my chest
But I can see you're unimpressed
So leave me be

Let me rest in peace
let me get some sleep
Let me take my love and bury it

I lay my body down
But I can't find my sweet release

Family and friends
All the twists and bends
Knowing that it ends
Well, that depends
On if they let you go
On if they know enough to know
That when you've bowed
You leave the crowd

There was no pain
No fear, no doubt

Of Heaven

Cause I've been expelled

Well sir, all I can say is

James McMurtry,"I'm not from here
I just live here
Grew up somewhere far away
Came here thinking I'd never stay long
I'd be going back soon someday

It's been a few years since I got here
Seen `em come and I've seen `em go
Crowds assemble, they hang out awhile
Then they melt away like an early snow

Onto some bright future somewhere
Down the road to points unknown
Sending post cards when they get there
Wherever it is they think they're goin'

I'm not from here
I just live here
Can't say that it matters much
I read the papers and I watch the nightly news
Who's to say I'm out of touch?

Nobody's from here
Most of us just live here
locals long since moved away
sold their played-out farms for parking lots
went off looking for a better way

Onto some bright future somewhere
Better times on down the road
Wonder if they ever got there
Wherever it is they thought they'd go

Hit my home town a couple years back
Hard to say just how it felt
But it looked like so many towns I might've been through on my way to somewhere else

I'm not from here
But people tell me it's not like it used to be
They say I should've been here back about ten years
Before it got ruined by folks like me

We can't help it
We just keep moving
It's been that way since long ago
Since the Stone Age, chasing the great herds
We mostly go where we have to go

Onto some bright future somewhere
Down the road to points unknown
Sending post cards when we get there
Wherever it is they think we'll go

You're a little bit late
We rolled up the sidewalks
At a quarter to eight

May I ask what you're doin' here

Hey what you up to
I already know
I heard the boys
Talkin' at the Texaco

And the news travels
Quicker than wheels

Who you lookin' for
What was his name
You can probably find him
At the football game
It's a small town
You know what I mean
It's a small town, son
And we all support the team

The preacher drove by in his Cadillac
I waved at him but he didn't wave back
It's a small town
Everybody knows your face
It's a small town, son
And we all must know our place

And I called old Mrs. White
I figured she could tell me
What I did last night

She walked on tiptoes
On a gravel bar
Wet skin pale as the evening star
The North Platte winding like a silver eel
Hands like rain on August fields

Hands like rain
Falling soft
To ease the drought inside
As memory fades
Not much remains
But hands like rain

Now I stand on stiff legs
And I clutch the cane
And I search the sky for a sign of rain
As if it matters
As if it makes a damn
Just an old man's habit

Down the street
The schoolboys play
Dime novel heroes from another day
Who now are nothing more than faceless names
And a nameless face with hands like rain

And we'd hide by day

On stolen horses and borrowed time
Dancing girls and brandy wine

They're calling me
I can here them calling
But I still can't see

Mindin my own business, gonna get back outta here

You better not go in there, if you don't know what that's for

Sizin up their prospects, sharpin up their knives

They better stay off of the west side where the black tar flows
They hide in their sheltered enclaves up around Olmos Park
They got their own policeman so they can stay out way past dark

Back down in Piedras Negras, the children play with dirt
We keep our pistols loaded so we don't get hurt
No importa a nadie, it's always been that way
Never gonna get no different, long as we got our say

From the track meets and the tennis games he'd win

Now he reads a lot of poetry and plays
He'll sit out in the backyard
And not say a word to anyone for days
And his folks gave up
They no longer even bother getting through

They must have figured there's just so much you can do

In the scrapbook in the drawer with her pearls

Down across the Delaware

We barely have to speak at all
Small talk over take-out pizza
Silently passing in the hall
Post-It notes... and opposite shifts
Once in a blue moon we'll wake up in the same room
Thankful for these thy many gifts

We run by night, we live it and breathe it
We're the best of the best and I just don't care

And I'll see you in the spring
When the chill don't cut so deep
I'll be back around to give this town another crack at me.

From somewhere down in the southern sticks
I turned around to see some ragged stranger
Bummin change on the uptown six

Could I ever get that low?
Turned my face to the window
There by the grace of God I go

Time you're old enough the honky-tonks'll all be gone.""

Momma had no sense with cars
She drove a Sunbeam and she drove it hard
Left her stranded time and again
Didn't matter, you could do that then

And they danced on the rooftops
Let their hearts run wild
Such a sight to the eyes of a child

We were used to all the best
The man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Wild, Wild West
We ruled the skies from a backyard swing
Nothing that flies could've stopped that thing

While they danced on the rooftops
Let their hearts run wild
Such a sight to the eyes of a child

Blood-stained blacktops twist up between the wheels
Before we knew it it was all too real
The voice of reason confined to the past
And all that mattered was to get there fast
So we could dance on the rooftops
Let our hearts run wild (hearts run wild)

Should it all come down to your last thin dime
You can dial that number one more time
But the phone won't ring 'cause the line's gone dead
It's lost in history
Like I said, it's gone

So now we give it all we got
Pick em up at daycare in a state of shock
Frayed at the edges and torn at the seams
It rarely happens in our wildest dreams
That we dance on the rooftops, let our hearts run wild
And it ain't for the sake of the child

Makes you wonder why they stopped here
Wagon must have lost a wheel or they lacked ambition one
On the great migration west 
Separated from the rest
Though they might have tried their best
They never caught the sun
So they sunk some roots down in the dirt 
To keep from blowin' off the earth
Built a town around here
And when the dust had all but cleared

Stood on his own two feet
His mind got incomplete and they put in the home

Sucks the water table dry
Rolling sprinklers circle round
Bleedin' it to the bone
And I won't be here when it comes a day 
It all dries up and blows away
I'd hang around just to see
But they never had much use for me in Levelland
They don't understand me out in Levelland

And I watch those jet trails carving up that big blue sky
Coast to coasters watch 'em go
And I never would blame 'em one damn bit

Since we got the satellite dish and
I can hear the marching band
Doin' the best they can
They're playing ""Smoke on the Water"", ""Joy to the World""

Got some change left over yet and I'm

Just trying to get home. 
I woke up in a strange world
I can aptly describe
It's like the streets of a town where I lived
When I was too young to drive
It all looks so Familiar
But I can't find my way

When I went out to play

Don't open my eyes
To nothing like truth

Let it hide in the blindness of youth

Most likely will always remain
And I guess I'll be lost in the back yard
Till I get home again

",Lost in the Back Yard,1995
James McMurtry,"Answer me when I call to you
What became of the life I knew
Tell me why I can't be free
Tell me what you expect of me
I'm so down about it
I can't sleep at night
I sit watching the bugs as they bounce off the light

Answer me when I'm calling out
Tell me what's all the noise about
Explain to me the rules of love
Tell me just what I'm guilty of
I somehow I must've missed it
I never knew I was blind
Repeat it real slow so I get it this time

(chorus)
I'm off and running to take what's mine
I'm off and running again

I 'm off and running
To take what's mine
I'm off and running
And I won't get caught this time
With my soul on empty and my face to the wind
I'm off and running
I'm off and running again

Answer me when I call your name
What'd you do with my ball and chain?
I'm out here in the open air
And I can't find it anywhere
And I'm so lost without it
It was such a part of me
I guess I'll get along
How hard can it be?

",Off and Running,1995
James McMurtry,"You come back now, looking for a clue
Expecting everybody to fall all over you
If you missed it so, this one-light town
Why'd you go and leave with the snow coming down?

(chorus)
I was chasing after what was mine
No explaining, there was no more time
One more winter would've been my last
I could feel it slipping from my grasp

You come back now, and you don't look bad
You must've made the best of the time you had
Since you cut and run, like they said you would
And we got along without you just as best we could

(chorus)
Well I don't expect you'll ever see
But you're not my maker and you don't judge me
One more winter would've been my last
And I don't go dwelling on my past

I could not sit here listening to the wind against these walls
I still hear it whistling in the whispers of them all

And I come back now, but I won't stay long
There hasn't much changed since I been gone
No I won't stay long, you need not fear
I just came back to see if I had ever been here.

I could not be like one of them
Faces shrunken from the bitter wind
Their righteous rage, their jealous fear

And the coal cars were dusted with a half inch of snow
And that boy'll drive me crazy
Don't know what I'll do with him
School will be out tomorrow if that cold front moves in 
Calling out
To the dying daylight
The shadows of the mountains
Bringing on the night

He favors your side in his face
When he gets a little older
He's going to lead a merry chase

It Isn't going to wound my pride
If anyone can claim they're all right
So can I

I wrecked the El Camino
Would have been DWI
So I just walked off and left it
Laying on its side
The troopers found it in the morning 
And they said it's purely luck I wasn't killed
I probably ought to quit my drinking
But I don't believe I will

He used to ask about you
About a million times a day
I got so tired of trying to answer
I just turned my head away
Now he don't pay me much attention
He's not asking anymore
I guess he'd probably know you
If you walked back in the door

Calling out to the empty night
Watching as the snowflakes
Come dancing round the light
Dancing up against the window
It's like they're peeking through the glass
And they hover for a moment 
And then they fall on past
Calling out

Standing here all stupified and stunned

Had enough of my blinding insight
Well I guess I can't blame you none

Keeps on rearing its ugly head again
But I could use a rayolight
Had enough of this mindless fight
Right now we're both too tired to win

And rest this thing
Find us a place where the creeks run clear
And the phone don't ring

Sooner or later they'll wear down smooth and shiny

(chorus)

There's traffic on the street
It's getting pale in the east
We'll be all right for now at least

There's a rayolight stabbing through
Could be we learned a trick or two
As the streetlights fade we can pull the shades
And rest this thing
Find us a place where the creeks runs clear

watched as a kid
Neglecting my homework

And if you were here with me, I'd tell you these things

Right here now

There's an old magic eight ball next to my plate
And I ask it a question regarding my fate
It says, ""reply hazy, please try again,""
It won't say where I'm going, it don't know where I've been

And you look intently straight ahead pretending I'm not here
And you look me in the eye and tell me it's not about us
Then you tell me I'm so silly to be making such a fuss
So everything's OK but your nervous as a cat
What's that say about me that you think I'd fall for that

Plow it under in nothing flat

We could plant some maize, we could plant some cotton
We could plant some oats just to see if they'd grow
But I don't like farming, can't take the hours
Don't like a life that goes so slow

Right on the highway out by Air Base road
Looks like a Wal-Mart waiting to happen
I mean to tell you it's a pot of gold

It's in the city limits and zoned commercial
City water and a sewer line
With the base expanding, consolidation
It's worth a fortune and it oughta been mine

My cousin Roscoe Slayton's oldest boy from his second marriage up in Illinois
He was raised in East St. Louis by his momma's people 
Where they do things different 
Thought he'd just come on down
He was going to Dallas Texas in a semi truck called from that big McDonald's
You know the one they built up on that great big ol' bridge
Across the Will Rogers Turnpike
Took the Big Cabin exit stopped and bought a couple of cartons of cigarettes
At that Indian Smoke Shop with the big neon smoke rings
In the Cherokee Nation hit Muskogee late that night 
Somebody ran a stoplight at the Shawnee Bypass 
Roscoe tried to miss 'em but he didn't quite 

Bob and Mae come up from little town
Way down by lake Texoma where he coaches football
They were two A champions now for two years running
But he says they won't be this year no they won't be this year
And he stopped off in Tushka at that ""Pop's Knife and Gun"" place
Bought a SKS rifle and a couple a full cases of that steel core ammo
With the berdan primers from some East bloc nation that no longer needs 'em
And a Desert Eagle that's one great big ol' pistol 
I mean .50 caliber made by bad ass Hebrews 
And some surplus tracers for that old BAR of Slayton's
Soon as it gets dark we're gonna have us a time
We're gonna have us a time

Ruth Ann and Lynn come down from Baxter Springs
That's one hell raisin' town way up in Southeastern Kansas
Got a biker bar next to the lingerie store
That's got them Rolling Stones lips up there where everyone can see 'em
And they burn all night you know they burn all night you know they burn all night

Ruth Ann and Lynn they wear them cut off britches and those skinny little halters
And they're second cousins to me
Man I don't care I want to get between 'em
With a great big ol' hard on like a old bois d' arc fence post
You could hang a pipe rail gait from 
Do some twisted sisters 'til the cows come home 
And we'd be havin' us a time

Uncle Slayton's got his Texan pride
Back in the thickets with his Asian bride
He's cut that corner pasture into acre lots' 
He sells 'em owner financed
Strictly to them that's got no kind of credit 'cCause he knows they're slackers
When they miss that payment
Then he takes it back 
He plays that Choctaw Bingo every Friday night
Drinks that Johnny Walker at that Club 69

And a cherry coke we're goin' to Oklahoma Gonna have us a time",Choctaw Bingo,2002

Ever crossed your lips in my company
Straight bourbon whiskey was all we'd abide
So let's don't hold back now, we've got nothing to hide

So much we savored yet so much we missed
You know I never meant you to see me like this
Just a faint distant flicker from the last of the storm
You know a taste of that liquor could do me no harm

Light me a candle, light me a fire
Come and sit by the window with the shades drawn
To the best of intentions and the worst of desires
Leave by the Gulf Road in the gray dawn

Take a short handled shovel, take a long handled hoe
Cover my bones when the west wind blows
Smooth it off even and pack it down hard
Now, no more be here but I'll never be far
I'll no more be here but I'll never be far

Look off down the highway

at the glittering lights

Like windshield glass

on the shoulder tonight

As the diesels come

grinding on up from the plains

All bunched up like pearls on a string

And I guess time don't mean nothin'

Not nothin' at all

And out on the horizon

the broken stars fall

Old broken stars they

fall down on the land

And get mixed together

with the lights of Cheyenne


Well I've been up all night

and I'm down on my back

Workin' the counter

to take up the slack

'Cause the money tree's light

and the whiskey stream's low

You ain't worked a week

since July


You say the gravel pit's hiring

After the first

But you don't have the

nature for that kind of work

You might get hired on

But you won't make a hand

And I'll still be here lookin'

at the lights of Cheyenne


You stand in the sky

with your feet on the ground

Never suspectin' a thing

But if the sky were to

move you might never be found

Never be heard from again


We go on good behavior when

our youngest comes home

She comes up from Boulder

but she never stays long

And that oldest still fights

me like she was 18

Stopped in for a 6-pack awhile ago


And she's got a cowboy problem

And this last one's a sight

All dressed up like Gunsmoke

for Saturday night

And they were off to the bars

for lack of a plan

Racing the stars to the lights of Cheyenne


And you've kept all that

meanness inside you so long

You'd fight with a fence post

if it looked at your wrong

Well the post won't hit back,

and it won't call the law

I look at your right,

or I don't look at all


Now take a crumpled up

soft pack and give it a shake

Out by the dumpster on a cigarette break

With one eye swelled up from

the back of your hand

And the other eye fixed

on the lights of Cheyenne


You stand in the sky with

your feet on the ground

Never suspectin' a thing

But if the sky were to

move you might never be found

Never be heard from again


Now there's antelope grazing

in range of my gun

Come opening weekend

you won't see a one

They'll vanish like ghosts

'cause somehow they know

But now they're up to the

fence in the early dawn


And it's warming up nicely

for this time of year

The creeks are still frozen but

the roads are all clear

And I don't have it in me

to make one more stand

Though I never much cared f

or the lights of Cheyenne

Where have been? I don?t want to know

Probably some place I wouldn?t want to go

Who were you with? What did you see?

Whatcha talk about? Whatcha say about me?


Where have you been? I won?t let it drop

What were you thinking? When you gonna stop?

What were you thinking? When you gonna learn?

When you gonna give anything in return?

What were you thinking? It better be good

When you gonna act like you know you should?

When you gonna act like you know you should?

When you gonna do like you said you would?


Well it goes all night like a broken record

You know it wouldn?t take all that muchTo bring me down from all that pressureI guess you just know when it?s bad enough


Well it goes all night like a broken record

We come right back to the same old stuff

We don?t back down and it don?t get betterI guess you just now when it?s bad enough


The car?s on the curb, the key?s in the lock

Houses all dark up and down the block

Swaying on the sidewalk, sneaking through the door

Waitin? for the sound of your shoes on the floor

Waiting for the gallows, waiting for the noose

Waiting for the sound of your combat boots

?Cause the order?s come down to launch the attach

Scheduled to commence the minute I get back

James McMurtry,"Aunt Clara kept her bible right next to the phone
In case she needed a quote while she talked to someone
In my memory she smiles while the blessings said
And visions of freeze tag dance in my head
She says I'll grow up big if I eat all my roast
That I'll still believe in heaven but I won't believe in ghosts anymore

I'll put away childish things, I'll put away childish things

Every other weekend, age of thirteen
With my fishing pole and my feelings string
Riding back home on the Trailways bus
I looked out the window till I saw too much
And I called my parents by their own first names
I played in the alley but I didn't play the game anymore

I put away childish things, I put away childish things

The wolves howl all night long
They won't stop and they won't go home
Beneath my window they run
Probably it'll be alright
If I keep it all locked up tight
And wait till daylight comes

Now my boy goes like a house on fire
He'll never burn out and he'll never retire
And I remember when I used to think like that
When I was young and the world was flat
But I'm forty some years old now and man I don't care
All I won't now is just a comfortable chair
And to sell all my stock and live on the coast
I don't believe in heaven but I still believe in ghosts

I've put away childish things, I've put away childish things
I've put away childish things, I've put away childish things

The wolves howl all night long
They won't stop and they won't go home
Beneath my window they run
Probably it'll be alright
If I keep it all locked up tight
And wait till daylight comes

Called him a son of a bitch

But Mary don?t cry just stands there and takes it

Doesn?t seem to feel a thing

No Mary don?t cry, you know she?s a big girl

Wonder what made her so mad

She takes those licks looking in through the den door

Staring right straight at her dad


There?s a big yellow thing on a flat bed trailer

Daddy nearly hit that bird

They?re both in the front seat

Starin? right straight ahead

Wonder if the cat?s alright

Picked you up in Pocatello

In some truck stop parking lot

Out beside that burned up Volvo

With the smoking engine shot

And you just left that Volvo lying

You never gave it half a thought

Faithless, fine, and gone


You said you came from Randolph

Up across the Wasatch Range

You kept talking clear to Salt Lake

Liked to drove us all insane

But now I?m flying down

That four lane highway screaming out your name

Faithless, fine, and gone


Batten down the hatches I can hear my grandma say

Boy you like to play with matches

Gonna burn yourself someday


I?m gonna haul on back to Denver

Just as soon as I get through

And I?m burnt down to smoldering embers

But I guess I can make do

And now I hear some guy that used to

Manage some band I never heard of

Is trying to manage you

James McMurtry,"There's a Vietnam Vet with a cardboard sign
Sitting there by the left turn line
The flag on his wheelchair flapping in the breeze
One leg missing and both hands free

No one?s paying much mind to him
The V.A. budget?s just stretched so thin
And now there's more coming back from the Mideast war
We can't make it here anymore

And that big ol? building was the textile mill
That fed our kids and it paid our bills
But they turned us out and they closed the doors
'Cause we can't make it here anymore

You see those pallets piled up on the loading dock
They're just gonna sit there ?til they rot
?Cause there's nothing to ship, nothing to pack
Just busted concrete and rusted tracks

Empty storefronts around the square
There's a needle in the gutter and glass everywhere
You don't come down here unless you're looking to score
We can't make it here anymore

The bar?s still open but man it?s slow
The tip jar?s light and the register?s low
The bartender don't have much to say
The regular crowd gets thinner each day

Some have maxed out all their credit cards
Some are working two jobs and living in cars
Minimum wage won't pay for a roof, won't pay for a drink
If you gotta have proof just try it yourself Mr. C.E.O.
See how far 5.15 an hour will go
Take a part time job at one your stores
I bet you can't make it here anymore

And there's a high school girl with a bourgeois dream
Just like the pictures in the magazine
She found on the floor of the laundromat
A woman with kids can forget all that

If she comes up pregnant what'll she do
Forget the career and forget about school
Can she live on faith? Live on hope?
High on Jesus or hooked on dope
When it?s way too late to just say no
You can't make it here anymore

Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store
Just like the ones we made before
?Cept this one came from Singapore
I guess we can't make it here anymore

Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin
Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in
Should I hate ?em for having our jobs today
No I hate the men sent the jobs away

I can see them all now, they haunt my dreams
All lily white and squeaky clean
They've never known want, they'll never know need
Their shit don't stink and their kids won't bleed
Their kids won't bleed in their damn little war
And we can't make it here anymore

Will I work for food, will I die for oil
Will kill for power and to us the spoils
The billionaires get to pay less tax
The working poor get to fall through the cracks

So let ?em eat jellybeans let ?em eat cake
Let ?em eat shit, whatever it takes
They can join the Air Force or join the Corps
If they can't make it here anymore

So that's how it is, that's what we got
If the president wants to admit it or not
You can read it in the paper, read it on the wall
Hear it on the wind if you're listening at all
Get out of that limo, look us in the eye
Call us on the cell phone tell us all why

In Dayton Ohio or Portland Maine
Or a cotton gin out on the great high plains
That's done closed down along with the school
And the hospital and the swimming pool

Dust devils dance in the noonday heat
There's rats in the alley and trash in the street
Gang graffiti on a boxcar door

James McMurtry,"Does the Governor know who killed the fishermen?
On the lake last night?
Was the cigarette boat comin' 'round the point like a bat out of hell
Wasn't burnin' his lights?

The cigarette boat is not even legal
The lake's too narrow to be goin' that fast
Two fishermen sat in an old green Jon boat
Makin' one more cast

Full moon rising big and pale
That cigarette boat didn't even slow down
It was throwin' up a big old rooster tail
And it ran right through 'em with a sickening sound

Does the Governor know who killed the fishermen?
Does the Governor know who killed the fishermen?

The game warden's here and the EMS
They hauled up the body with a rope and a hook
They got no leads and no suspects
State trooper says they're not even gonna look

Does the Governor know who killed the fishermen?
Had to have been some fat cat
Them cigarette boats, they cost many
Can't just anybody buy a boat like that

Does the Governor know who killed the fishermen?

They can't find the boat, they can't find the trailer
They were watchin' the ramps, big mistake
I'll bet you the farm it's in somebodies' boathouse
It never made the ramp and it's still on the lake

They try to get a warrant...dream all you want
they won't be searchin' any lake front homes
Justice is blind to them that own it

James McMurtry,"The hurricane party's windin' down 
and we're all waitin' for the end
And I don't won't another drink, 
I only want that last one again

He gave me such a fine glow, 
smokin' slow, now I should probably be homeward bound

[Chorus]
There's just no one to talk to 
when the lines go down

I guess that in the morning I'll go lookin' for my gray-striped cat
My old house can take the weather so I'm not too concerned about that
It was built to take the wind back in nineteen-and-ten when this was one damned fine town

[Chorus]

Candles flickered on the back bar and the building was shakin' with the wind
I bought a whiskey for the gypsy and she turned my leather back into skin
Just a fleeting sense of that rare suspense I once thought made the world go round

[Chorus]

Open up your back screen door
Let me see your face once more
My hands are cold and my feet so sore
And I can't go on this way

And the thoughts come too fast and too many to keep count, best just to let 'em on through
Now I'm breaking those glass insulators with my old 22
Off the telephone polls as a half dollar rolls across the knuckles of a rodeo clown

[Chorus]

My one great love, my God, I can feel her still
She ran off to California and now she's living in those Hollywood hills
With some bullfrog prince, I've not seen her since
Though she calls when he's out of town

[Chorus]

Open up your back screen door
Let me in your space once more
I was looking for an easy score
But it just don't work that way

Some insurance man-biker is yellin' out for one more beer
But a part-time pirate just can't get much respect around here
We got our problems too, man we'll get to you
In just a minute, sit your drunk ass down

[Chorus]

Now there's water up past the wheel wells of my
Ford and I don't guess that it'll run
But I left a pack of Winston's on the dash, could you fetch 'em for me son?

I don't have to punch a clock

In the winter with some friends?
My divorce will be final
Along about then

And don't you know I hurt way down inside?

Out here givin' it all we got
We don't want to get old and die
And there ain't nothing we wouldn't try

I could take retirement in 10 years

Ruby standing just outside the front porch light
Chain smoking camel straights

\""You're right it's getting late

And stayed off that slippery slope

Well that's just how they do nowadays
We should all have been so lucky

By spring she'd had the run of the free born men

Black eyed brown and youthful face
Smiling back from a Saudi base

Heavier now and longer haired
Looking past the saddle shed 
From way on bac inside his head

And the old vet said one day Rube
that colt will break an egg in you
Now and then one comes along
You just can't ride and he went on home

But she cupped it just in time
Then she sent that ashtray flying

Carlos took the road gig 
And he saw it through
He rode the tour bus 
While the singer flew

Managed out a music row,
Carlos never saw the studio
The session guys had that all sewn up

He looks out the window 
And it starts to sleet
Laying on a friends couch on Nevada street
Lately he's been staying high
Sick all winter and they don't know why
They don't know why or they just won't say
They don't talk much down at the V.A

And Ruby's in his thoughts some times
What thoughts can get out past the wine
He feels her fingers on his brow
And right then he misses how
She looked in that grey morning light

She never shaved like they all do now
He sees it all behind his eyes
And his hands go searching but they come up dry

Half way in that waking dream
Carlos lets the land line ring

He'd never guess it was Ruby calling
A pin in her hip from the grey colt falling
Figure eights and a lazy lope
Stumbled on that slippery slope

I saw Pete and Johnny too

Dressed up in their Sunday suits

Getting themselves all up to go

Down to Richmond to the traveling show

I fixed the gate like you told me to

Done my chores like I always do

And I won?t tell mama you let me go

Down to Richmond to the traveling show


Please Papa can I go

Down to Richmond to the traveling show

Please Papa don?t you say I can?t

I just want to see the elephant


I?ll borrow the truck from uncle Phil

You know I can drive it well

He won?t need it now that the hay?s all in

Just let me go and see the elephant


Sister she can?t go with me

This is not for her to see

Little brother you?ll get your chance

To go down and see the elephant

To go down and see the elephant

She gets a little restless in the spring

She might follow the lines you sing

Bullshit though they are

?Cause sometimes that?s just the thing

If delivered with panache and a certain graceFingertips on satin lace

Cutting cards and quoting Proust

Whatever turns her wild mare loose


She gets a little restless now and then

She feels the changes in the wind

Way down deep where I can?t see

She can get clean away from me

With a side step and subtle shift

And the turning of a key

Locks me out and lets me drift

She?ll come back if I let her be

She?ll come back if I let her be


And I?m just a little down tonight

I?m just a little down

A little messed up is all I?m saying

Just a little down tonightI?m just a little down

But I believe I?ll make it

Believe I?ll make it


She gets a little restless I can tell

When she goes back up inside her shell

And the conversation slows

To a stop and I might as well

Be out alone on the highway

Way off in the Utah sage

Waving to the railroad crew

That?s when I get restless too


She gets a little restless in the spring

She might follow the lines you sing

Bullshit though they are

Sometimes that?s just the thing

Stood on his own two feet

Coast to coasters watch 'em go

Look off down the highway

at the glittering lights

Like windshield glass

on the shoulder tonight

As the diesels come

grinding on up from the plains

All bunched up like pearls on a string

And I guess time don't mean nothin'

Not nothin' at all

And out on the horizon

the broken stars fall

Old broken stars they

fall down on the land

And get mixed together

with the lights of Cheyenne


Well I've been up all night

and I'm down on my back

Workin' the counter

to take up the slack

'Cause the money tree's light

and the whiskey stream's low

You ain't worked a week

since July


You say the gravel pit's hiring

After the first

But you don't have the

nature for that kind of work

You might get hired on

But you won't make a hand

And I'll still be here lookin'

at the lights of Cheyenne


You stand in the sky

with your feet on the ground

Never suspectin' a thing

But if the sky were to

move you might never be found

Never be heard from again


We go on good behavior when

our youngest comes home

She comes up from Boulder

but she never stays long

And that oldest still fights

me like she was 18

Stopped in for a 6-pack awhile ago


And she's got a cowboy problem

And this last one's a sight

All dressed up like Gunsmoke

for Saturday night

And they were off to the bars

for lack of a plan

Racing the stars to the lights of Cheyenne


And you've kept all that

meanness inside you so long

You'd fight with a fence post

if it looked at your wrong

Well the post won't hit back,

and it won't call the law

I look at your right,

or I don't look at all


Now take a crumpled up

soft pack and give it a shake

Out by the dumpster on a cigarette break

With one eye swelled up from

the back of your hand

And the other eye fixed

on the lights of Cheyenne


You stand in the sky with

your feet on the ground

Never suspectin' a thing

But if the sky were to

move you might never be found

Never be heard from again


Now there's antelope grazing

in range of my gun

Come opening weekend

you won't see a one

They'll vanish like ghosts

'cause somehow they know

But now they're up to the

fence in the early dawn


And it's warming up nicely

for this time of year

The creeks are still frozen but

the roads are all clear

And I don't have it in me

to make one more stand

Though I never much cared f

or the lights of Cheyenne

James McMurtry & the Heartless Bastards,"I guess we knew the cards were stacked
started out the best of friends
and we beat that highway 'till it quit beating back
it didn't mean much in the end some you win, some you lose
some you throw away
we headed South across those Colorado plains
just as empty as the daywe looked around at all we saw
remembered all we'd hoped to see
looking out through the bugs on the windshield
somebody said to me

(chorus)
no more buffalo
blue skies or open road
no more rodeo
no more noise
take this Cadillac
park it out in back
mama's calling
put away the toys

don't chase that carrot
'till it makes you sick
what do you think you're gonna prove
just let it dangle 
'till it falls off that stick
that's when you make your move

don't go chasing after shooting stars
trying to make yourself a name
you could joust at the windmills
with that old Fender guitar
you'd probably do about the same

(chorus)

I never thought they'd ever doubt my words
I guess they were just too tired to care
I'd point to the horizon
to the dust of the herds
still hovering in the air
somebody said it aint any such
man you wish so hard you're scaring me
and those are combines kicking up that dust
but I guess you can see what you want to see
you can keep on chasing what used to be there
top that rise and face the pain

but man they were here
they were here I swear
not just these bleaching bones
stretching across the plain

James McMurtry & the Heartless Bastards,"They broke into your car last night,
took the stereo
Now you say you don't know why 
you even live there anymore
The garage man didn't see a thing, 
so you guess it was an inside job
You made a reservation, a table for three
They said you'd have to wait, 
somebody must have bribed the maitre'd
Boss got mad and he blamed it all on you
Food was bad and the deal fell through

(chorus)
Well out here in the middle
you can park it on the street
Step up to the counter; 
you nearly always get a seat
Nobody steals. Nobody cheats
Wish you were here my love
Wish you here my love

We got tractor pulls and Red Man chew Corporate relo refugees that need love too 
we ain't seen Elvis in a year or two
we got justification for wealth and greed~
Amber waves of grain and bathtub speed
We even got Starbucks
what else you need?

(chorus)

Out here in the middle
Where the center's on the right
And the ghost of William Jennings Bryan preaches every night
To save the lonely souls
in the dashboard lights
Wish you were here my love
Wish you were here my love

And we screen all applicants

James McMurtry & the Heartless Bastards,"Must be a cold front coming
Cause I saw the eastbound C&O
And the coal cars were dusted with a half inch of snow
And that boy'll drive me crazy
Don't know what I'll do with him
School will be out tomorrow if that cold front moves in 
Calling out
To the dying daylight
The shadows of the mountains
Bringing on the night

The old folks like to whisper
He favors your side in his face
When he gets a little older
He's going to lead a merry chase

(chorus)
When I'm all alone it's all right
It Isn't going to wound my pride
If anyone can claim they're all right
So can I

I wrecked the El Camino
Would have been DWI
So I just walked off and left it
Laying on its side
The troopers found it in the morning 
And they said it's purely luck I wasn't killed
I probably ought to quit my drinking
But I don't believe I will

(chorus)

He used to ask about you
About a million times a day
I got so tired of trying to answer
I just turned my head away
Now he don't pay me much attention
He's not asking anymore
I guess he'd probably know you
If you walked back in the door

Calling out to the empty night
Watching as the snowflakes
Come dancing round the light
Dancing up against the window
It's like they're peeking through the glass
And they hover for a moment 
And then they fall on past
Calling out

With your head hung down
Papers blowin' through the streets of town

Of your posters down

Boldfaced lies

I hadn't intended, To bend the rules
Whiskey don't make liars, It just makes fools
So I didn't mean to say it, But I meant what I said

Too long in the wasteland

cuttin' cross the horizon, At the edge of the day

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Leaving only hearts to break

And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

Oh I ain't got long to stay here, what little time I've got
I want to rest content while I remain
'Til death shall call this dog and me to find a better home
Than that little old log cabin in the lane",Log Cabin in the Lane,1991
James Monroe,"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said ""Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die""
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones",Long Black Veil,1991
James Monroe,"It was midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And pressed me to her loving breast

Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will sometime times stray
To thee when thou art far away

I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as time
But you have proven untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine

Then fare-thee-well I'd rather make
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine",Midnight on the Stormy Deep,1991
James Monroe,"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain 
And planted some pines in the sand 
Every day I looked their way 
But just couldn't understand 

Why they never grew like I thought they should do 
I just couldn't understand why 
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through 
And today I just happened by 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I bet you wouldn't know me now

I'll never forget the morning I left 
The hum of the bees in the hay 
The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today 

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch 
Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone 
There waiting to join me in the shade 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs",Tall Pines,1991
James Monroe,"The wind is blowing 'cross the mountains
And out on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go

Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die

Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love will bloom forever, darling
When we rest side by side

I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear her through the walls of time
",Walls of Time,1991
James Monroe,"Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
Maybe we can live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

The castles we built of dreams together
Are the sweetest stories ever told
But in my dreams they live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

James Monroe,"See that train coming round the bend
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold
Her eyes were as blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose
And she promised she would always love me

Body and soul, body and soul
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
Her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are fallin' like rain

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

James Moody,"A long time ago 
A million years BC 
The best things in life 
Were absolutely free. 
But no one appreciated 
A sky that was always blue. 
And no one congratulated 
A moon that was always new. 
So it was planned that they would vanish now and them 
And you must pay before you get them back again. 
That's what storms were made for 
And you shouldn't be afraid for 
Every time it rains it rains 
Pennies from heaven. 
Don't you know each cloud contains 
Pennies from heaven. 
You'll find yor fortune falling 
All over town. 
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down. 
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers. 
If you want the things you love 
You must have showers. 
So when you hear it thunder 
Don't run under a tree. 
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999

Went to the house that brings a smile

In the album of my memory

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

James Morrison,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were A Bell,
James Morrison,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

James Morrison,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,

James Morrison,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town

James Morrison,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2004
James Morrison,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Will color all my dreams

It was far, too high

I will be remembering

Is there anybody home?

Where is the simple song?
Even the birds have lost their music

Tell me what is going on
Well, tell me what is going on

And we live our lives through magazines
And see our neighbors on TV
Hope someday that we can be like them
And ain't it sad that deep inside
We lost ourselves and don't know why
I look up to the sky when I'm alone
And I wonder is there's anybody home

Everybody's gonna say it's crazy
They say that it can't be done
When did we all stopped dreaming
About a world where everyone belongs
Where everyone belongs

The children lost their childhood
The mothers have lost their strength
The fathers have to keep on working

Till the day the money's spent
Oh, before they drop and die

Well, we turn our back on what is real
We don't even know how it feels
Really want to buy a bigger car
Baby ain't it true that deep in you
This feeling lives and lingers too
You look up to the sky when you're alone
And you wonder is there's anybody home

Tell me, tell me, tell me what is going on

James Morrison,"You want to stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep,
I was meant to tread the water
Now I've gotten in too deep,
For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away.

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart.

You already waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me,
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
I can't work out what the mean,
I never thought that I'd love someone,
That was someone else's dream.

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something,
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart,
But it might me a second too late,
And the words I could never say
Gonna come out anyway.

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,

Please give me something,
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing

But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something

Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling on your threads saying
Breaking yourself up

If it's a broken heart then face it

And go your own way

Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine

Hang on

Stay strong

Know your name
And go your own way

And everything, everything will be fine

Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?

Are the things that make you blow

Of faulty manufacturing

Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all

There's so much going on it gets hard to breathe
All my faith has gone you bring it back to me
You make it real for me
Well I'm not sure of my priorities
I've lost site of where I'm meant to be
And like holy water washing over me

You make it real for me
And I'm running to you baby
You are the only one who save me
That's why I've been missing you lately
'Cause you make it real for me

When my head is strong but my heart is weak
I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty
But I can find the words
You teach my heart to speak

You make it real for me
And I'm running to you baby
You are the only one who save me
That's why I've been missing you lately
'Cause you make it real for me

Everybody's talking in words
I don't understand
You got to be the only one
Who knows just who I am
And you shine in the distance
I hope I can make it through
'Cause the only place
That I want to be
Is right back home with you

I guess there's so much more
I have to run
But if you're here with me
I know which way to turn
You always give me somewhere,
Somewhere I can run

Everyone must change

Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes everything must change

And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

James Morrison,"Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed
It's perdido

The maestro took bow after bow
He said, “My dear friends I have given my all. 
I'm sorry, it's all over now.”
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini 
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to

Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to

And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
‘I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to

Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?

Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher,
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,

There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!

Is her delight, they say,
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees,
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs.
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

I think it's time to take it back to where we started from, 
Your pain, my pain, 
I'll write it down and tell you exactly how I feel again. 

And all I see, 
Is a mass of confusion, who I am and what I gotta be, 
Yeah. 

Closed eyes, big lines, 
I guess you'll tell me just to let it ride sometimes, 
Looks good, tastes bad, 
Makes me wonder where I buried all the dreams I had. 

All I see, 
Is a less good version of a man I don't wanna be. 
All I feel, 
Is you tie me down to something that just isn't real. 
All I need, 
Is some truth god help me, 
Before the devil buries me. 

Yeah 

I can't do nothing, if I can't do something my way, 
Well I must be crazy if I follow every word you say. 
When the shit comes down, you'll be the first to walk away. 

[Chorus] 
Call the police, 
Cause I've lost control and I really wanna see you bleed. 

I'm awake, why wait? 
I don't need someone to tell me who to be today. 
I'm quite sure, unlike before, 
Came off the road and I forgot what I was looking for. 

All I see, 
Is a lees good version of a man I don't wanna be. 
All I feel, 
Is you tie me down to something that just isn't real. 
All I need, 
Is some truth god help me, 
Before the devil buries me, yeah. 

I can't do nothing, if I can't do something my way, 
Well I must be crazy if I follow every word you say. 
When the shit comes down, you're the first to walk away 

[Chorus] 

You can't just hack at me, you know, 
You might just, have to let me go. 
Close in, I need some room to grow, 
You don't, know what you're thinking of. 
Hiding behind you're pop sheet, 
So you, can reck someone elses dream. 

[Chorus] 

I can't do nothing, if I can't do something my way, 

Well I must be crazy if I follow every word you say. 

When the shit comes down, you'll be the first to walk away.

James Morrison,"I don't believe you
And I never will
Oh I can't live by your side with the lies you've tried to instill
I can't take anymore, I don't have to give you a reason
For leaving this time
Cause this is my last goodbye

It's like I hardly know you
But maybe I never did
It's like every emotion you showed me, you kept well hid
And every true word that you ever spoke, was really deceiving
Now I'm leaving this time
Cause this is my last goodbye

I've got to turn and walk away
I don't have anything left to say
I haven't already said before
I've grown tired of being used
And I'm sick and tired of being accused
Now I'm walking away from you
And I'm not coming back

I don't believe you
And I never will
Oh I can't live by your side with the lies you've tried to instill
I can't take anymore, I don't have to give you a reason
For leaving this time
Cause this is my last goodbye

Oh I, I've got to turn and walk away
I don't have anything left to say
I haven't already said before
And I've grown tired of being used
And I'm sick and tired of being accused
Now I'm walking away from you
And I'm not coming back

And I don't believe you
And I never will
Oh I can't take anymore, I don't have to give you a reason
For leaving this time
This is my last goodbye

James Morrison,"It's got my name on it, 
And it's just waiting there for me, 
I feel the cold run through my veins. 

and it's got her shame on it, 
She couldnt say it to my face, 
But I won't waste time placing blame. 

[Chorus] 
But I know that I'll move on, 
And tell myself I'll find me something better, 
I let go and just forget her. 
She was no good for me, 
Deep down I know that's the way it has to be so, 
How comes I still can't open this letter? 
I can't forget her. 

Really wish I could 

Well, there must be a name for it, 
Whatever this is you've done to me, 
I'm all twisted up inside. 

Well who's gonna pay for it, 
If it's not you I guess it's me, 
You left with you're life and took mine.

it's got my name on it, 
And it's just waiting there for me.",The Letter,2007
James Morrison,"In my life I don't mean much to anyone
I've lost my way can't go back anymore
Once I had everything now it's gone
Don't tell me again coz I've heard it all before

Some people say that I'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
Guess I'll give it a try

I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never and I try to remember who I used to be
I've got one more chance to get myself together

The time has come for me to change again
I can't carry on like this, I will lose my friends - don't say that you have given up on me
Just give me the time and speace to heal my head
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
Guess I'll give it a try

I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never and I try to remember who I used to be
I've got one more chance to get myself together

I don't wanna be misunderstood
I've got to take this chance and make it into something good

Some people say that I'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
Guess I'll give it a try

I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never and I try to remember who I used to be
I've got one more chance to get myself together

I got one last chance.
Well you know it's all I need.
Is one last chance,",One Last Chance,2007
James Morrison,"I've been twisting and turning,
In a space that's too small.
I've been drawing the line and watching it fall,
You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart.
Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart.

Well I can't explain why it's not enough, Cause I gave it all to you.
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now.
Its the better thing to do,
Its time to surrender,
Its been to long pretending.
There's no use in trying,
When the pieces don't fit anymore, Pieces don't fit here anymore.

You pulled me under,
I had to give in.
Such a beautiful myth,
That's breaking my skin.
Well I'll hide all the bruises,
I'll hide all the damage that's done.
But I show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone.

Well I can't explain why it's not enough, Cause I gave it all to you.
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now.
Its the better thing to do,
Its time to surrender,
Its been to long pretending.
There's no use in trying,
When the pieces don't fit anymore, Pieces don't fit here anymore.

Oh don't misunderstand,
How I feel.
Cause I've tried, yes I've tried.
But still I don't know why, no I don't know why.
I don't know why, why!

Well I can't explain why it's not enough, Cause I gave it all to you.
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now.

James Morrison,"This boy wants to play, there's no time left today
It's a shame cause he has to go home
This boy's got to work, got to sweat just to pay what he gets to get left all alone
But let's step outside, let's go for a ride just for awhile
No we won't get caught, well that's what I thought until we cried

I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy
I'm sure that you had your reasons
I'm scared if all this in motion
For years I've been holding you down
For years I've been holding you down

This girl tries her best everyday, but it's all gone to waste cause there's no one around
This girl she can draw, she can paint
Likes to dance, she can skate, now she don't make a sound
We'll play in the park, dinner's too dark for us to see
Well we'll make our way home, with mud on our clothes, she won't be pleased

I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy
I'm sure that you had your reasons
I'm scared if all this in motion
For years I've been holding you down

And I'd love to forgive and forget
So I tried to put all this behind us
Just know that my arms are wide open
The older I get the more that I know
Well it's time to let this go

I got to let it go, I got to let it go
I got to let it go, I got to let it go

I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy
I'm sure that you had your reasons
I'm scared if all this in motion
For years I've been holding you down

And I'd love to forgive and forget
So I tried to put all this behind us
Just know that my arms are wide open
The older I get the more that I know

And I'd love to forgive and forget
So I tried to put all this behind us
Just know that my arms are wide open
The older I get the more that I know
Well it's time to let this go",This Boy,2007
James Morrison,"I was sure, I was born and raised to be my own man
I was so sure; I was never going to need a helping hand
And she said, trust in your heart and there's no need to understand
Well just when I thought I had it planned out

Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you

I was driving too close to the edge and living dangerously
I felt strange a warm sensation rising up inside of me
Oh like a tidal wave came from nowhere swept me off my feet

Oh but somehow making me complete now

Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you

James Morrison,"I look at you, you bite your tongue 
I don't know why or where I'm coming from 
And in my head I'm close to you 
We're in the rain still searching for the sun 

You think that I wanna run and hide 
I'll keep it all locked up inside 
I just want you to find me 
I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered 
We're never alone we're all the same as each other 
You see the look that's on my face 
You might think I'm out of place 
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered 

Well the time it takes to know someone 
It all can change before you know it's gone 
So close your eyes and feel the way 
I'm with you now believe there's nothing wrong 

You think that I wanna run and hide 
I'll keep it all locked up inside 
I just want you to find me

James Morrison,"I've been down so low people look at me and they know,
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong,
Well, staring through a window standing outside there just to happy to care
And I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again,
I tripped them out when God kicked outside everybody's soul.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now,
I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now,
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,
But I can only see when you're here, here with me.

Sometimes I feel so full that it just comes spilling out,
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily,
But if I had someone I would do anything and never never never never let you feel alone
I won't, I won't leave you on your own,
Who am I to dream, dreams are for fools, they always let you down.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I cant feel it right now,
I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now,
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,
But I can only see when you're here, here with me.

And I wish that I could make it better,
I'd give anything for you to call me,
Maybe just a little letter
Oh it could start again.

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I cant feel it right now,
I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now,
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,
But I can only see when you're here, here with me.

I know that its a wonderful world
But I cant feel it right now,
Iv got all the right clothes to wear I just wanna cry now,

But I can only see well when your here, here with me.

James Morrison,"You want to stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep
I was meant to tread the water
Now I've gotten in too deep
For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart

You already waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
I can't work out what they mean
I never thought that I'd love someone
That was someone else's dream

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart
But it might me a second too late
And the words I could never say
Gonna come out anyway

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something

James Morrison,"Oh, I'm counting down
Hoping the time has come
To let it out
Never a time I had tried to breathe
I feel suffocated, I'm on my knees

I felt the cold and dark run through my veins
Shivered when I heard her call my name

She burns like summer sun
I know she's the only one I want
Even when she's gone, wait
I felt the heat on my skin
When my head started to spin
Too much is never enough
She burns like summer sun, for me

Oh, I'm holding out
Now that the time has come
For giving in
So just for tonight would you keep me warm
Take away my pain
Help me forget it all

Shivered when I heard her call my name

No, yeah she burns

The time has come I'm counting down
Hear my breath and I let it out
Now there's nothing left she can take from me

I know she's the only one I want
Even when she's gone, wait
I felt the heat on my skin
When my head started to spin

She burns like summer sun, oh no
