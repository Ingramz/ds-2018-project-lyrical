Aye fourth quarter, I'm goin' hard

The Lamborghini Bugatti all in the same yard
I want the freak and the lady all in the same broad
Ballin' way before Jim Jones
I gots to be the richest nigga with this skin tone
Somebody get the doctor on the phone
My diagnosis, I got gettin' money syndrome
Hey! I got that hustler's disease
I got paper chasin' tendencies and they yet to find a remedy
So shorty feelin' me the way I be dressin'
She like my white tee, neck V, Polo pressin'
My tie gold and purple and my three-piece vest and
I'm a young woman's blessin', a married woman's confession
To older women you can call me cougar bait
To all you haters I'ma call you too late

Move a hundred B's garbage bag full of cash
Goin' to the lot, shittin' on they ass
Weed's in the Hummer, two fifty on the dash
Yeah, early in the mornin' where the sun shine
Got a yacht in the yard, ocean fly
Ocean time, ocean view
Pearly white waves, on them twenty twos
Five new Bentley's, out the paper bag
To the paper tag (shinin' on they ass)

"Baby ""Cash Money""","We want to use our vote, so then, we just vote
So we vote
But we don't, we're not actually, I feel like we're not actually being heard
We're just kind of being patted on the head, and quietened, yeah absolutely

We really care about these things, that's why we're here, that's why we're getting together in force
To be here and to say something, to show you, to show you and to make a change
But then we really kind of, we're just, pawns in this life
And you're like, allowing us to have our playtime
It's like, relax, water's down there in its impact, doesn't it?",Pawns,2017
Baby & Lil' Wayne,"Yo, I go by the name
(I'm yo' Pusha) Of Pharrell from the Neptunes
And I just wanna let y'all know (I'm yo' Pusha)
The world is about to feel
Something (I'm yo' Pusha)
That they've never felt before, c'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard
I'm the neighborhood Pusha
Call me sub woofer, 'cause I pump bass like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy 'cause
Ball 'til you fall 'cause you could duck to the fetti govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)

Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
And disguised in this rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got hoes for a dozen
Even Eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

Niggas better stay in line, when (Whooof)
When you see a nigga like me shinin' (Grinding!)

My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake, I'm Grinding

I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood
Kids call me Mr. Sniffles, other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen, the other, noddin' and dozin', I'm grindin' Jack

Baby & Lil' Wayne,"Already, 
Know what I'm sayin' this Birdman and this how it's goin' down, 
That little youngin' Yo Gotti I certified him stamped approval and the jail,

They got us fucked up we been movin' birds bitch, they got us fucked up, 
They got you fucked up, then get you fucked we been movin' birds bitch

Quarters, quarters and halves, 
Chickens, chickens, and bricks, bundles, 
Bundles of dope, and ounces, ounces and shit  
Quarters, quarters and halves,

All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman

Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin', 
I run it myself like a quarterback option, 
I pitch a 10 G's tell a bitch to go shopping, 
She buy herself some clothes, 
And she brought me back a chopper, 
See niggas tryna kick it, 
But no I don't play soccer, 
I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker, 
A package on the way you know my whip game proper,
And all for one key I see seventy thousand dollas, 
Now I was shootin' dice, smokin' on a joint, 
I bet wit Yo Gotti, 
He hit five straight points, 
We ova' here hustlin', 
We ova here grindin', 
You rap about money and nigga might sign ya, 
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya, 
But ? yo ass what you hear right behind you
Dope game bitch let his mama worry bout him, 
You can holla at me for a fee but I 
Got Em'

I met the Birdman with the Bird layin', 
Got a twenty piece, brought it back to north Memphis charged twenty two a piece, 
Now I'm in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender, 
Low key in a rental, with them thangs in the fender, 
See I full time grind January to December, 
Put that snow in the summer got it lookin' like the winter,
I'm goin' back to Cali, I gotta get that light green, 
Mexico valley, you know they got them pine trees, 
18 wheeler, now I'm on I-10, on my way to Memphis,
I gotta get my hands in, 
I come from the north where gangstas gon' grind, 
Bitch niggas gon' whine, and hustlas gon' shine, 
Everybody say they trappin' but most of these niggas lyin', 
I told slim, told stunna I'm waitin' for my time, 
Either robbin', or poppin', click clack I shot 'em, bullets burryin', brr I got em'

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman

Back where I started on my set in black, 
Hop out the passenger side of my back, 
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack, 
But in my palm I had that chromed out mac, 
Shinin' on them bitches cause nigga I'm 'bout that,
Flip a quarter bird to score a whole sack, 
Pull up in the club in a old school 'lac, 
With a bitch ridin' fly so hide you love that, 
It's grind time, nigga been about that, 
We flippin' birds let them hoes go to sacs, 
We livin' large with the garbage bag flats, 
Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack, 
And ridin' fly, 25's on the back, 
Plushed out nigga keep a few stacks, 
Out the hood, 'bout money that's that,
If you ever cross the line best believe you gettin' whacked

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo,

Baby & Lil' Wayne,"[Chorus]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars,
Success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce
Hollywood divorce

(And I'm a star!)
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. 
I'm so not sober.
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda.
You can call me a roller. (Hold up)
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different.
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know.
And did you know I'm the creator of the term?
I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long. 
They just making it burn.
Make a movie of our lifestyle,
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax 
Like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga
Cooler than anti-freeze 
Defrost on your window pane 
Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne
Don't make me nut
So that's why I got a pre-nup
(I do)

[Chorus]

(Yeah, Yeah)
A is for Adamsville
Be is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck 
If you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, 
I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your un-
Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest 
Three fourths of it all
(For what?) 
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? 
Get get get get get on your knees
Cause 'wealth' is the word (yep)
'Rich' is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? 
Shoot me a bird

Tenth grade 
The way was paved 
For me and Dre. to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein 
The arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin
Been jamming for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint 
Public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears 
And think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel 
All new cast
Just ain't the same 
Gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name 
Behind that screen name
They're lame 
And their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face 
Straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
(What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot?)
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk 
We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes 
Must be something bigger waiting

[Chorus]

(I do) 
Love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, 
It's game time
Do you take this here 
As your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her 
For all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share 
Take you there
And me and you together 
Baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time 
We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence (Is that right?)
But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce. 
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our game
Take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb 
That's a cold thing",Hollywood Divorce,2006

She in love with a hustla, someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

[Chorus:]

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
'Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce

Met this lady, she was off the hook
A playa got hard off her sexy look
To my homies I said that she was crazy horny
And, like most bitches she was dumb and corny
Well, the truth is that this girl was mad intelligent
I wanted to follow her ass everywhere it went
Yes Suh! This mama turned me on
But then she met some slick-talkin' playa and was gone
He was a nasty playa who called her a queen
Now, I can't do that, I am a pimp-machine
Sometimes I wish that pretty bitch still was mine

Baby Bash,"Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
And I trust you mom 
But the doesn't mean my lust for fun, want to bust my gun 
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
To the treasure up the post 
You just never fucking know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance 
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass 

I be sayin' though, livin' my life, wishin' and hopin'
I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

I be sayin though taken away from the frustration 
I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination 
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive",Pollution,2003

Need to chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop

I'm with my Momma rent-a-car with ten and a half pounds
No DL's, an endless amount of rounds
With my mind on my mansion, I'm smashin' about the town
You thought I was a hog
Wait till I clown now
That's when you believe me, disturbin' three for the fifty
And I wish that motherfucker would try to get with me
'Cause I'm nifty with the milly when the torch is on
And play every play like its fourth and long
Now when the horse is gone, I beat the shit out the pig
It don't take much to split a fool's wig
See I'm only one shot from making the headlines
So quick niggas are quarters and dead lines
Shakin' the bed time, they checking my barcode

Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical

Nationwide with thugs, locked out it's just us
With the Feds and the police out to bust us

And stay wicked, and plus we keep it explicit
Abducted by the streets see it's hard to manage

But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower
Late night gobbler
Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'

Tryin' to charge me for that trash ass, pussy, she out of mind
Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)
My neighbor is what she lay her head under (Under)

Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that
Choose me, she know the scope, it's pimpin', no love for a hoe
Lucky, yeah, they love me, and they wanted me to hit it

She's in love with a hustla 
She don't be messing with them suckas 
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on 
And I know that she be feeling me 

She in love with a hustla', someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs 

[Chorus] 

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa 
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, 
But she don't give a damn

I'm a spit some of this real game
Some real shit, some real talk
Na, na, whoa, oh, whoa

Ugh, check my watch, check my chain
It's simple and plain, the Chevy wit the blew out brains
As I bounce and mash, count this cash
Floss and flash, cop and blow a zip wit Bash

Since everything is big in Texas then where's the zag's?
I'm across the finish line, tell me where's the flags?
Brought my rag top, should have brought the Jag
On the beach me and Beesh, look at all this ass

I could tell you stories but can show you cash
Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass
To the next playa hater and he'll break like glass
Now I got a bunch of people digging' through my pads

So I choose to floss 'cause who's the boss, let's ink it
It's Richie Rich for those who thought re-think it
Some yell it and tell it, I blow it and smoke it and smell it
Let's spend tokens wit my people who sell it, what?

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
But it's really nothin' though
But it's really nothin' though

I could show you somethin' dirty deep up in them corners mayne
What's the deal?
I could bend the block and make it hotter than a Forman grill
I got the keys to the Chevy Caprice
I could show you mother fuckin' snitches straight to Belize

Now that's low, fa sho', conspiracy and parole
I could show you real cats doin' time over a ho
I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design

I could show you streetlights and heart beak hotels
I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo
Down to do what I gotta do to satisfy the man in me
And from the looks of thangs the popo's ain't understandin' me

The original digital scale reader
The pedigree playa who be stackin' his Velveeta
I could show you boss stuntin' so fuckin' disgustin'
I could show you rapper's frontin' but mayne it's really nothin'

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
But it's really nothin' though
But it's really nothin' though

I could show you, I could reach you and teach you
I know you and where you comin' from, I understand it
This been goin' on forever dog, it's no end
Life is like a bullet in your back from a close friend

Disappointed to the point where I'm runnin' by myself
Never knowin' where I'm goin' start to wonder myself, yeah
Money was a necessity, my greed got the best of me
You think you smokin' Uncle be, who got the recipe?

I'm sayin' it's nothin', I say it sincerely, and speakin' clearly
I'd rather you respect me than fear me
I came a long way and still I got a while to go
You probably thinkin' to yourself, ""What's he smilin' for?""

My dog Bash about to be platinum doin' his thang
So if you hate him for it, boy you fakin' and know it
We takin' this money, big bundles of bills
I'm like a whole 'nother person when it come to this skrill

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
But it's really nothin' though
But it's really nothin' though

I can show you better than I can tell ya

My stles so cold
Holla for the gold
Some say I'm to drunk
Some say I'm to blowed
And rollin kilos I'm stackin these C notes
Watchin my cheeses grow and blowin on trees though
And I really can't help it I'm addicted to time gorilla grind
And no time for groupies or free stylin
Want it green as a getco I'm respectful to some of you'll
But some of you'll be frontin I don't owe shit to none of you'll
I got bills to comprehend po-pos be poppin in
Waitin and watchin when they could take my block in
I'm in and outta traffic supplyin they bad habbit
The game is gettin graphic but main I gotta have it
Son of a drug addict but that ain't no excuse I got these
Money makin skills I mma put em to use
And I ain't doin to much you'll just ain't doin enough
And I refuse to let a so called ruin my stuff

[Verse 2]
I'm movin
Ain't got nothin to say
Cause 24 hours ain't enough time in the day
So time doesn't exist ain't no watch on my wrist
If a peck on the cheek means death
Watch for the kiss
I stay calm under pressure
By any means or measure
Remember ones trash is another mans treasure
Business before pleasure I'm disciplined and I'm forced
While you rap cats battle to see who dopest
I'm in the trenches face down in the game bra
And can't nobody no my real name bra
Livin in the seasons they killin for no reason
If I make it pass 30 then I'm over achivin
Belivin in the truth belivin in the way
The life that I follow might bring me a brighter day
In the truth in the way
The life that the life that I follow
Might bring me a brighter day

Find somethin' I can take back to tha mo-mo

What you got under that skirt, girl whatchu talkin' 'bout?

She's always on time and never a day late
She's never on a diet, my pockets they gain weight
And me without her is some I can't take

Now we gone ride like the wind, my lover, my dividends
She's my fatty, I'm her daddy and she's my best friend
Got me spending weekends in Kingston Jamaica
Ooh my favorite chicken, ooh, I love my paper

And when she step out of line, that he gone get on the grind
Facing penitentiary time, but she's eventually mine
The same color as my hydro, I swear I've got the only breezy
That I die for, my mind sold

In love with this cheddar, me and her go together
Like birds of one feather, she keep me riding on leather
And chrome, you know it's on when my baby come home
She's my playboy bunny, that's sweeter than honeycomb

That's my lady, she will never jack me down

That's my baby, she's gone always be around
(Money, money, money)
She will never play me, she'll stay true when I leave town
(Money, money, money)

Got my mind on my money, got my money on my mind

Love at first sight, sex on the first night
My blessing when I'm stressing, she's keeping my game tight
She's doing the thing right, she's beeping compliancy
If I'm Ricky Ricardo, then she's my Lucy

My fly serenity, my pocket is energy
As a matter of fact, she's gone bring the Hennessey
I loved to hold her, fold her, her love is so douja
Got them dime pieces making love to my poster
(What is it?)

I'm loving this part of the game
And my money ain't genocide I got to explain
Swinging her from lane to lane, we doing the damn thing
My money, my motivation, my national campaign

That's my lady, she will never jack me down

She will never play me, she'll stray true when I leave town

[SUGAFREE]
Hey sugafree why roxy jock'n
Probly because she don't want you to know she got caught watchin a parrot fuck a carrot of some of that oxy cotton
She said one time at band camp she was a rat
And sold girl scout cookies lyin flat on her back
One day I was in the middle of some sucka duckin
Got tired of throwin my hood up at this trick
Bust up like it was nothin
I met her out the blue sky, I truly neva knew why
But kept it pimpin in that ora she love me 'cause I'm to fly

CHORUS:
'cause I'm the only kinda man that she'll eva understand because that's what the pimpins there for
She rather deal with a mack and keep her flat on her back because that's what the pimpins there for

SUGAFREE:

But you don't hear me though

You need to pray and repent
She might be ya girlfriend yeah but she my trim
And I ain't payin respects I'm just takin the checks
And beat the shit outa buff niggas fakin the flex
We keep it A O B....all on baby
Y'all pay for puss man y'all so crazy
Ya trick harder than the N be A
And got mad when ya be's got sent my way
'cause you in love with yaself and she in love with ya wealth
And wanna grin while she still fuckin everyone else

If I push the right buttons I could sell her a dream
And y'all still poppin collars imma dust my kicks
While y'all still go to clubs and handcuff yo bitch

Would last us so long

Wishing I was home
For sure with you in it
But the soldiers that
I'm runnin' with
Are ready to blitz

My time is spent reflecting
On all the lil' things
You said I was neglecting
They say you never know
What you have until it's gone
Didn't know back then
But I will from now on
When I try to channel out
All the fear and the stress
I picture me and you rollin'
Looking dressed to impress
And to know you'll be there
When I'm back from Iraq
And feel good to know
A real chica I have on my back

Give everybody huggs
And tell em' I really miss em '
And your boy be back

Bros do it real sumo, that's what it is

I'm a Dope House profit, suckers can't stop it
They might got muscle but they got no logic
And I got a big heart by the size of a lion
Five minus four, girl, without even tryin'

Now stir that up and add it up
From Mexico to Canada
Professional, no amateur
And you gon' bust two times, when I smack it up

Then beat it up, then spank it up
'Til the **** DJ crank it up
I strip the game butt-naked, girl, line by line

You can go red or brown but it still ain't right

They about drama, I'm about bakin'
Never would I fake 'cause I just don't purr
Ten thousand square feet and you ain't even gotta work

'Cause I'm the cash and the check one, candy paint wet one
Space fly like a punk rock Jetson
Always down to holla, holla, let's bet one

Hop on, don't miss the jet

And I don't even trip off battle raps
Blow so much purp', I get asthma attacks
Find this thick little mami and I handle that

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
Things ain't like they used to be, baby girl, you're losing me

I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
What would you do?

Well, now the thrill is long gone, the feelin' is all wrong
Got me feelin' uncomfortable all in my own home
And your ring tone song deleted from my phone
And damn, I use to love that song when it came on

And no this ain't 'bout no new company
It's just time for you to do you and me to do me
And you know, and you know that I know, that I know
That we don't belong together no more, no more

And even though the memories still make me wanna believe
The facts I gotta face em, it's over, it's history
'Cause you know, we gotta breath and I don't wanna deceive
A lie or get it twisted so, baby, I gotta leave

I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to
Now, baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back

Well, now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock
When the lovin' was so hot, good to the last drop
And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time
Wait before the tears and the years on the grind

Now you lookin' at me crazy every time you hear my phone ring
Use to get along better back when we was homies
Use to keep it low key, now we fight in public
Argue about anything and every single subject

So now I think it's better if we just keep it movin'
I won't trip off you and you won't trip off what I'm doin'
'Cause baby, this ain't crackin' like it use to be
I think you just got a little use to me

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
Things ain't like they used to be, baby girl, you're losing me

And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time
Wait before the tears and the years on the grind

I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking
And we should be apart, now it's over like a holiday
I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking
And we should be apart, now it's over

Follow dat train mane follow that caboosie
Ain't nothin in the world like some thick and some juicy
She goin downtown cuz her favorite DJ's spinnin
I'm all up in the door so I'm already winnin
I got a lotta women but I'm way too choosy
And man I love my cake like that Ricky love Lucy
On some peanutbutter leather with the wood so grainy
It must be rainin dollars cuz she's lookin so gravy
Sophisticated lady poppin till the end what it do what it is

And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

My lifestyle so cold, holla for the gold
Some say I'm too drunk, some say I'm too blowed
Hold the kilos, and watch the weeds grow
And stacking see-note, on top of see-note
And ooh, my mama love me but found a new man
Took all that she should take, five years I'm still praying
Damn it's out of hand, balling out of control
I love the fame and the fortune, but I sold my soul
Bring it back Lord, help me bring it back, help me
Straighten out my act, all I know is making money slanging yack
On the track, and smoking fat sacks with my mistress
What is this, my life as a misfit

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Now I don't know what you done heard
Anywhere you go, one do love herb
Like two little birds, kissing in the trees
An angel up above, been whispering to me
Said I'm living in a dream, and it isn't what it seems

Once wanted fame, now I wish it wasn't me
You know, I got a fly groove, so many time zones
Quick to get my rhyme on, listen to it when I'm gone
I was born, to put the boogie in your shoes
Hit the doobie when you through, pass it to me on the cool
I'm a fool for the flipping, spit for those who love me
Thought I knew the game, but it ain't so funny

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Come on now, help me get up out of the rain
I'm blessed with the joy, but cursed with the pain
Come on now, everybody knowing my name
Ask Little Ronny, can you spare some change
See I'm tired of the game, tired of the lies
Now all I wanna do is keep my eyes on the prize
Rise to the occasion, interrogation is my persuasion
To do the thangs I do, keep the average head aching
Waking up at noon, listen to the tune
I'm dedicated to my first love, back in high school
Went from close pin to kingpin, every weekend
Shining like a star, but far from what I'm seeking

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong

Man that thing you got behind you is amazing (amazing, amazing, amazing)
You make me want to take you out
And let it rain (let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
I know you got a man but this is what you should say

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never looking back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5 
And I'm leavin' never looking back again?
So call you shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one that keep you high
Have me singing all night night night
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, man she got me singing
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Now if I talk it girl,
You know that I will walk it out (walk it out, walk it out, walk it out)
Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is (mouth is, mouth is, mouth is)
Cause you the baddest little thing
That I've ever seen (ever seen, ever seen, ever seen)
So I'ma ask you one time if you got a man

[Chorus]

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left left left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Cause we gone and we gone and we gone
No stress, no stress, no stress

No stress, no stress, no stress

Baby Bash,"I believe in never let my strip get hotter
Than something I can get out of
One that heats up on me
I told 'em this would be a once time dance
Meaning one time chance
After I said that, oh
That's when he got close to me
All the other music stopped but the violin
Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle of the best
Now I'm asking myself ""what has he done to me?""

This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck
To come and get me

Dip me in water
'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it
'Cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know
If I'm going or coming
Dip me in water
'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body
Put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale, on me

Gotta call a cab
If I don't need gonna have me
With every young stunna' in the hood wanna have me
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender
'Cause I know where this could end up
And with that right now I can't play
I know I drive him loco
But that's just the way
You make a mama's hips go

This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck
To come and get me

Dip me in water

Can't say I don't want it

In a way that I don't know

Keep the bottle pourin' 'til we need a submarine
When she off caffeine, baby girl you're so active
Strong as a mattress, grab on my package

Go-go boots from the stage to the cage
California wild fire, hot in a rage
Check her Facebook page, video upload
My number one hina, so damn throw, so damn cold

Candy-coated like Skittles
I'm a pop that like I pop two thizzles
Girl, get your smash on, sweet and low so tender

But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
We can do it on the wall, do it on the floor
Once I get up in them legs, you be coming back for more
So girl, let me show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom (Bedroom)

I like 'em jazzy, sassy, classy, noisy and nasty
Don't harass me, after I finish beatin' the chassis
Beast in the bedroom, king-size, leg room
Turn your whole, world 'round, things that make your head boom
In the mornin', on the floor, take a shower, back for me
Neverendin' stories, she adore me, but no ""Mi amor""
Do it with a player's stance, I'm a savage in the sheets
Been bustin' freaks, since, gettin' cabbage in them streets

Girl, I don't wanna love ya, just wanna (Take it down)
Come spend the night with me, I turn your (Life around)
So girl, give me them legs, I don't know what they said
But I'm a beast, beast-beast-beast (In the bed)

[Chorus]

One day alone, in my zone, turn the lights (Down)
See, I'm a do it right, let's do it, right now
Cause ain't no time for waitin', my clock is always tickin'
Whole night, numb you up, leave your body, bed ridden
And when I hook it to the left, it's like I'm bendin' corners
Get up in ya, get up on ya, hot, as Arizona
Here come the splash down, welcome to Bashtown
Ankles up, ass down, blowin' out your back now

Girl, I don't wanna love ya, just wanna (Take it down)
Come spend the night with me, I turn your (Life around)
So girl, give me them legs, I don't know what they said
But I'm a beast, beast-beast-beast (In the bed)

Body shakin', takin' cold showers to cool down
Beated repeatedly, constantly make you move 'round
You know what it do, girl, I'm a make them toes curl
Findin' all the right spots, got it locked, on the pearl
It's not the Macanera, it's not the same ol'
See, what we do is like the horizontal tango
Girl, I'm a stretch you out, mama, I'm a fill you up
And if you think, you can hang, I'm a try your love

Don't move, girl, let-let me grab my camera phone
Talk to me, baby, you ain't got no man yet
Weekend in the Bahamas, you got plans yet
I'll tell you anythang if I could see that coochie rang
Lay-lay it down like Ballin G {Up on that California cage}
I like to watch her move her body like a rattlesnake
Ass vibrate the room like an earthquake
Slow-slow motion, her body screwed up
It must be some purple in the cup
Cause she movin' so slow {Slow, slow}

Get you over the hotel balcony, rip out the ?

Bringin' out the beast in me, I'm a mess up your hairdo

Squares don't understando
Play like a piano when I'm flipping through the
Channel, man don't make me lose convultions, chokin'
On some doja, cars keep flippin' over 
Getting' Jags and Testerosas
Motorola, Coca-Cola, stay high and never sober 
Got them hot girls makin' love to my poster
Attitude kinda flippy, pockets never skimpy 
Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Fifty-fifty I'm a playa, slash money maker by nature
I get that paper pushin' green and snowyflaka
Make a good girl turn to sinna 
Puttin' inches all up in her
Blaze the bitch up now she's a bread winner
I'm a gold digga, kick a hole through your front door

I used to get spankings from my momma
But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The
Bahamas, got a pair of Versace pajamas 
Little mommas say I'm a sex symbol
I come through with the blue Coug
And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
'cause it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine
Every time you talkin' down my rhyme 
Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines 
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine
Little Christian on a mission 
But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano 
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto
Nigga I'm the one, the Christian 
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes 
Representing of the way Houston
These boys ain't ready for the age of Levy in a SS
Chevy on perely 
Nigga I be sippin' lean 
And I'm counting green
'cause boy I'm all about my feria (feria).

[Third Verse]
I promise this song is harder than my dick is
I won in the Olympics for cooking the most chickens
Gold medal around my necka, living la vida chueca
Puck checka, chuck wrecka, nobody do it betta
I'm best when under presha, smoke up in my chest
Momma mad, 'cause I just just failed my piss test 
Brain deader than a door knob 
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house 
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more
I put holes up in they asses 
Broke em' like some glasses

Answers your questions, throwed as Mexicans
Snatch your bitch up and dig deep in her intestines.

Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas

And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts

And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa

And stacking see-note, on top of see-note
And ooh, my mama love me but found a new man
Took all that she should take, five years I'm still praying
Damn it's out of hand, balling out of control

Quick to get my rhyme on, listen to it when I'm gone

Come on now, everybody knowing my name
Ask Little Ronny, can you spare some change
See I'm tired of the game, tired of the lies
Now all I want to do is keep my eyes on the prize
Rise to the occasion, interrogation is my persuasion
To do the things I do, keep the average head aching
Waking up at noon, listen to the tune
I'm dedicated to my first love, back in high school
Went from close pin to kingpin, every weekend
Shining like a star, but far from what I'm seeking

And she's a hustla, she like to stack her chips
And break bread with the click and roll the fancy whips

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka romance
Love to see me get the lapdance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand

Catch me ridin' on them numbers
Either four, five or six hundred
Top down, lookin' for a head hunter
If it's in a mob, she can't be my baby mother
You know, I wanna fuck you bitch
But I know, I'm not givin' you one red cent
My dough, ain't helpin' you with your rent
I never been a trick, you oughta pay for the dick

Slidin' on a slab and all she wanna do was rape me
But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower
Late night gobbler
Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'
I'm a let her know, I'm federal, when T bag that hoe like Lipton
And to inspire, she opened wide, and swimmin' in my denim (You, you, you, you, you bitch)

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
You don't roll twenties, girl, we pokin' in the side
I don't want no pussy ass, long as you open in your mind
No pussy could, but tell her put that throat up in your life
Got me a drug dealer ride, put liq' with coke up in her eye
Tryin' to charge me for that trash ass, pussy, she out of mind
Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)
My neighbor is what she lay her head under (Under)
Ain't no fillin' child support on me unless a nig get pregnant
Bitch, suck it while I'm behind the wheel, that's why I'm drivin' reckless
She a head hunter

[Chorus]

I don't love her, I don't want her, you can have her, I got another
Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that
Choose me, she know the scope, it's pimpin', no love for a hoe
Lucky, yeah, they love me, and they wanted me to hit it
If I put that dick up on her, she gon' get out there and get it

It seems like yesterday, my mama told me
Boy don't you go and throw your life away

[Baby Beesh]
Now it seems like yesterday I was on the block running
Yelling at the top of my lungs, that the ice cream man was coming
And if and never, I only had a buck fifty
I made sure, all the little homies act with me
Shooting Stars, Fudge Bars and them Drumsticks
Having fun with, players that I run with
Generation as weed and cess
Fast money, fast cars from the valley or the projects
And what's next for a miss got to greet you
But having heart, ain't something they can teach you
Playing ball, hoping one day to see the pros
And little roes saying peace to rest of shows

It seems like yesterday, me and the homies
We rode our bikes down to the school to play

[Baby Beesh]
Now I done seen a lot of gang fights never end trusted
It wasn't my thing, even though I was heavily recruited
I got blue ones caught up, and it's tragic
Doing ten years trying to stack some of that magic
And man I sure do miss him
And man I got warrants, so I can't even go visit him in prison
And I don't ride enough now I'm tripping
Shed a tear, now it's dripping I ain't bullshitting
One love, one life is your path right
Trying to maintain even on a bad day
Do your thing, stay away from the drama
I hear my mama, looking out for my karma

Down and dirty
Rough and rugged dog
Nasty but you love it
You gon' lick it
I'm gonna shove it, ugh-ugh, ugh
When I hit it from the back
You commence to cap
Grab yo toy baby grab yo strap
I'ma kick back light up a sack
Last name ""OFF"" first name is ""JACK""
You know the deal do
So grab the dildo
And let's do the damn thing
So I can tell my kin folks
About that there shit we did
About that there freak you did
And landed on my face, ooh
Baby girl but I love the taste
Got me livin' my fantasy
Baby come and dance for me
You got that candy cream
Let me see you pull yo panty string
Let yo thong slide to the side
Chica open wide
And let my fine ass baby mama put her tongue inside
Tongue kissin' naked to the world
Such a nasty girl
You got me fiendin' every time I'm dreamin' of the pearl
Twice last night, once in the mornin'
That's yo favorite song
It turns you on
Leave your pumps on
Baby watch me hit it strong
Baby Bashy you so nasty
Love the threesome for the top notch jazzies
Smokin' on some of that purple grassy
Now what yo body do

[Chorus x2]

[Mr. Shadow]
Ain't no tellin' what a fella gonna do
When it's me off Ren and you
On the phone when we getting' it on
Like the name off the song
It's just the freak in you, and me
Ya heard, fuck it, every body in this mutha fucka
We doin' this hit not givin' a shit
Shadow the chicken plucker
I want to know what you got on your mind
Is it the same as mine
We can bump and grind
And tell your friend she can come along, Why?
I would never leave her behind, hell no!
Never mind the love we share
Remember I'm a thug you bitch
Fuck her up rub 'round your dick
'cause all I give you dirty tricks and that's it
No shame in the game I play
Me and Bash got pie to lay
Texas Californ-I-A
Smokin' weed, pokin' bitches all night and day
Ride away in the hot one
Put my hook in the sea then I caught one
I gotta take it or leave it
And believe it or not
I got the eye of an eagle and I spot them

[Chorus x2]

[Don Cisco]
Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson
Me and two friends like Charlie Bronson
Locked up in a suite in between sheets
Gang bangin' top nothes, huh
I'm the bossiest playa like the freak Steve Austin
I don't give a fuck what shit be costin'
Keep bad bitches, pretty friends be flossin'
Sex and the City every time we tossin'
Never leave the pad without packin' precaution
Frisco Mac, so proceed with caution
You and these dudes are in these streets is often
Blaze up a sack get the chronic often
Outlaw on the run come ? me none
Don Cisco baby
When I ride, I'm bossin' on that ass
And ? rollin' pregnant
2-1-1 girl I like them odds
You can rock my world
I'll make you scream for the Gods
In between the sheets all night
I'll freak you hard
Keep it cool
What you speakin' on?
Shut your mouth and just tweak it on
Close your lips, leak you wrong

[Hook: Frankie J x2]
You know I like to watch
You I like to see it
I'm kinda freaky mama
Oh baby please believe it

Baby Beesh,"Hold up on the double, these boys want trouble
They call me Flintstone and my homie's born Rubble
Rebel, Devil, chase em' through the ghetto
Break these motherfuckers off with just one dedo
Metal bracelets, facin' worse incarceration
Aim for the dome gotta keep my concentration
Since elementary, it was destined for me,
To see the penitentiary
Late Friday, or was it Early Saturday?
I hit him with the shotty that I bought from the academy
Duck for cover, you marked motherfucking
Didn't Mama say not to play with niggas from the gutta?
I smell undercovers, I die with my brothers
And when I'm on the mic I represent all colors
Last summer, I escaped from an asylum,
You know the three digits, BITCH you better dial 'em

No matter where you at, do you represent your city?

Joint in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito
Turnin' ten into twenty, twenty into forty
Forty into eighty, everything is gravy
Why don't you play me in your deck-uh
Microphone Checker
Quick to grab a chicken head and clutch by the neck-uh
Double decker, hoes on my Woody Woodpecker
Niggas call me Grind say that I'm a home wrecker
Berreta under my Raider sweater
Fuck a fine loca by the name of Jueta
Stackin' mo chedda, then speedy Gonzales,
Smoother than the head of Mister Telly Sevalas
Tu sabes haciendo jales, movin' llaves
Order two tacos with the beans and nopales
dont blame us, just because I'm famous
And got my middle finger up your Baby Mama anus, BITCH!

Do you raise Ben Davis or do you sag Dickies?

I got sacks for sale in the land of Hell,
My enemies don't even get a chance to yell
In the black seville, with my man Miguel
Little beings wanna put my fuckin' ass in jail
Stack my mail, where the bastards dwell
Puffin' on Jane cause that's my girl
Never brag or tell, but I blast'em well,
I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell
Well, pick the chosen and form an alliance
Move in silence we got the loyal clients
Corporate giants, with street science
Cookin' dope on a kitchen appliance
Don't try it, if you can't keep quiet
I put seventeen bullets in your diet
Layin' in a puddle cause you hoes wanna rumble,

This is a remix...this is a remix 
""A-a-a-at-at night the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme"" 
High & Mighty, Wordsworth, Alkemist, Mr. Eon, wreckin' shit 
""A-a-a-at-at night the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme"" 
Mr. E-O-N must be talkin 'bout me 
(Who dat?) The one and only High & Mighty MC 
Who be perpendicular when I be dickin' ya 
E smoke a bone the size of a fibula 
Prepare for the slaughter, the lyrical marauder 
Unfreakable acts like me and your daughter, did 
I be coughin' layin' in the coffin 
Step out the fantasy world you be lost in 
Dead man walkin', engage you hawkin' 

From Pensauken to Vienna 
I be me and a slew to combat your crew 
With acrobatics only seen in cartoons 
Like the Go-ad Rucker, double-pumped ya 
Puncture, vocally rupture, puff a cluster 
Ambidextrous, both sides test this 
Removin' wackness like asbestos 

""A-at night, the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme"" 
""The open mic...the open mic...at night the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme"" 
""Open m-mic, I bring out that box to the shit.""

[Wordsworth] 

Yo check it out, yo. 
From cranadle to cradle and able to print 
I'm so deep that dirt's at my naval, my table submit 
You audio/video vaginal, lines imagine a magnitudes 
That give longitude and latitude some attitudes 

From an environment, freestyle's a requirement 
Upon every album, that my parents had to hide the rent 
If my demise commence unexpectantly, just test my pee 
I bet you see ecstasy or some obscenity inject in me (what else?) 
I flood your airways, place planes in jeopardy 
Flights vanish, panic deputies, expectancy for jet debris 
Let it be, and commence the record to play 
I'm so ahead of my time when I talk there's a seven second delay 
Don't judge a book by its cover when I'm inventin' 
I add your colon to my sentence, and start to pluck off on your appendix 
Dexterity hurled is about to rally the world 
You can't write without using like, what are you some type of valley girl? 
At open mics, I'm tellin' y'all one last time 
Stop askin' for a capellas and then kickin' those wack rhymes, flat line 
what, yo-yo-yo

[Thirstin Howl III] 

I'm accustomed to abiding by freestyle penal code 
My rhymes are like long drives going down a scenic road 
Taught discipline through paragraphs, walk back streets and narrow paths 
My kicks look dirty and pants sag like I have no ass! 
Flippin' styles that'd pioneered in the Space Age 
Writin' your first paragraph, I'm already on my eighth page 
For the way you write your rhymes, I could tell you never really made grades 
Going through life miserable, hatin' yourself on payday 
A pleasant plea, Thirstin in parentheses 
I heard a mute man mention me to a blind woman on Vescey Street 
Urged to leave gats alone in memory of Pumpkin and Faster Poem 
Wouldn't want my moms to identify me with half the dome! 
A toast, with high price gangrere 
Battle the best motherfuckers and whoever they bring here 
Long term, sought through rations 
I even put freestyle under special skills when submitting application 
Flows, that can't be followed by asthma patients 
Got a death wish? Here's his extension, ask for Satan 
The rap languages me and more, findin' subjects in Singapore 
Impressin' MC's who swore to God they'd seen it all

Baby Blak,"I got love for the game that's why I'm rhyming always stay in the booth
Never lying to the people always telling the truth
I feel the bass in my chest give power to songs
Girl ripping when I'm home about the hours I'm gone
I can't help it the studio where Paul be at
Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognized by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody their love the sound that's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you was spittin it
You got the whole run vibing the same
You ain't doing this for dollars and chains
You got love for the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop not for rap

(Yo I'm feeling you yams do the same thing yo)

For the love of the game
Only deal in dollars and change
Switch places for big faces one and the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the booth till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Keep the tools in the shed
Got a place to lay
But a place to stay
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan shark spaghetti no meat balls
At least y'all can eat y'all can feel my pain
When a cloudy day feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin of that day who this chrome gonna kill
Smiling women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming g's from Jeff
Pockets on my cheese on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ass cat see sack song writer worldwide doom ball rider
Feel my blood and tears but the love for the drug got me loved and revered
From these thugs for years
It's the game yo

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap

Yo black it seem like we both feeling the same
Remember when I walked away and you were still in the game
(Uh ha)
That shit was hot I'm still feeling the flame
Plus you never forgot every other verse spilling my name
Chilling with dames to will they range killin their brain with game
If not cousin I be still on the train
Like you said we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you making
Damn see family and we
Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in a lane
Keep heat for any hater wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so sat Jeff is phat

I attest to that
Still walk with dress room back
Same ghetto
Same whip
Still stressed on whack
Just wanna back y'all nothin less than that
Just want some cash cars and them records with black
It's just a game yo
But whether or not
I still got love for hip hop
It's the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can heal such a scar

I didn't have a choice but to lift you up
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice
From the womb my first cry, it was a joyful noise

I'm like the big King and she like my Queen wife

Little Derek's Ok (yeah)
Little Derek's doing fine (fine)
Little Derek's doing cool (cool)
You know how we do

Stepped out my house I'm feelin fresh and brand new
Olu did the trimry and I done the hairdo
And everything I wear's new
Mahadashi Jacket, Puma top,
Box-fresh jeans and nike cam boots
Sprayed a little versace dreamer on me too
So every girls who pass is like oo-oooh
Police don't pull us over like woo-woo
Cuz their kids watch MTV and channel U

But life ain't always been fine like baby blue
Cuz when u do UK rap your number two
Cuz the USA ain't giving us space to break true
So I'm on the grind trying to pioneer a breakthrough
Gotta keep the punters happy, to tango it takes two
And it seems like I'm the rapper the people take to
I've never had alot, with what I've got I've made do
And now I'm blowin up in this bitch like move-move-move

[Chorus: x2]

Step out the ride I'm feeling nice and quite fly
I'm trying to reach the top I see the top is quite high
Steady on my grind, tryin to get my face up in the source
So I keep by faith up in the boss
Up in the bright white sky

Getting calls from these record label bosses like hi
Head up in inside their offices
And listen to their promises
But no-one's made me offers yet that I could not deny

And I been making profits of this my mix tapes raw
Life ain't always been pretty like nah
On the north side of the city where its gritty like pie
We did what we had to done to get by
Hoping not get caught up in no silly drive-by
Little derek wrote lyrics while the others got high
And he ended up in HMV instead of HMP
Cuz street life could only end one way
Your friend crying on the scene like why, why, why?

(Baby Blue)
Knowin real fame
That's what I used to dream about
That everyone would know my name
And they would scream it out
Knowing my song words and sing along too
And I would walk down the street and hear blue, blue, blue

My video's rotating
So I got these execs debating
About whether I'm taking
And these RnB guys is asking the same thing
Calling up my phone, wondering whether I'm dating

I turn my passion to career how could I lose out?
Quit my nine to five so I don't have to sell shoes now
My CDs are moving
That's the route that I'm choosing
So I got to make it through, through, through
Little Rachael used to look up to the sky too
Analyse the planets and wonder if I could shine too
So now they ask how I'm doing I say
Little Rachael's doing okay

It's be Gizzle (Heard me)
(Cut the music up, Ya that's good)
Too Hood 2 Be Hollywood (Bust something, shoot something)
One of the realest niggas that ever done it, right chyea, live and in living color
(get em)

[Verse 1: B.G.]
It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass
I'm reppin nigga, take a flight to the motherland
I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you
Have yo people wearing a rest in peace shirt of you
My reputation on the block been A-1
I'm the same N.O. nigga I been since day

[Chorus: Lil Wayne (Trey Songz)]
I said bust somethin, shoot somethin
You just talking I know you ain't gon do nothin
Pussy nigga (ya heard me?)
If you got something to lose, you gon lose something unless you do something
So (ya heard me?)
Gotta use what you've learned, in order to receive what you've earned
Make sure (ya heard me)
Real niggas do real things so recognize real niggas in the game
I know you heard me
You say (ya heard me), I say (ya heard me), He say (ya heard me),
I know you heard me, she say (ya heard me), everybody like it when I say (ya heard me)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in, and I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

On this one right here, ya heard me?

See the ladies was buckin' from left to right
And the dudes was thuggin' from side to side
And it was a bum, bum bum, bum, bum bum snap
And a flickey flickey fresh and I added a clap

1, 2, Baby Boy, test the mic
And get the party jumpin'
For the rest of the night, yeah

Homie, I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
And my wrist on bling with a fresh so lean
Three hundred dolla jeans and my grill on bean
With my bundle in my jeans and it's real, homie

Naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen? Gentleman

I step up in the club lookin' freshin' than them other
Ice so bright make ya eyes Stevie Wonder
Way down under at the bottom of the boot
I just gotta keep it real, I just gotta speak the truth, speak the truth

I'll floss on you bitchez doin' 90 on the free
Gettin' lost on you bitchez
See, if you less than 500, I'ma boss on you bitchez
Hustle, hustle real hard, Rick Ross on you bitchez

If ya carrots ain't high, I don't wanna see ya jewelry
'Cuz my shit shinny, y'all be all blurry
I had to get up on ya, I had to do my thing
'Cuz I's so fresh and I's so clean

Homie, I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
And my wrist on bling with a fresh so lean
Three hundred dolla jeans and my grill on bean
With my bundle in my jeans and it's real, homie

Naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?

I'm back up in the spot, cleaner than a whistle
Count my diamonds on my neck, homeboy, not no crystals
Nigga, I'm the shit, better pass me the tissue
Red Monkey's on my ass, Baby Boy, it's official, it's official

I'll rock on you bitchez and my sickas don't stop
I'ma watch on you bitchez
Big rims, big truck will go knock on you bitchez
Goin' down right now, Yung Joc on you bitchez

If you ain't countin' stacks, you ain't fly like me
If you ain't roll in the deck, you can't ride with me
Niggaz spit to spare clean, neva eva trifflin'
Holla at my nigga soul 'cuz the nigga on bling

Homie, I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
And my wrist on bling with a fresh so lean
Three hundred dolla jeans and my grill on bean
With my bundle in my jeans and it's real, homie

Naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?

Walkin' everywhere, dustin' off myself
Time to flawn on you bitchez, time to show my wealth
Got a loft that I bought, got a condo in New York
Spendin' boo cool money but I gotta play it smart, play it smart

I maintain on you bitchez, in a different kind of whip
Switchin' lanes on you bitchez
And I know you niggaz hear I do my thang on you bitchez
I like my beat down low like the King on you bitchez

If ya cars don't cost about 80, 90 thousand
'Cuz my whips cost more than some of y'all houses
I got my grill and high bean with a fresh white tee
And I'm still so fresh, naw meen?

No FEMA checks, hustle hard, this a rich boy
New clothes, new style, new kicks boy

The reason why I claim rich 'cause I got a lil' change
I'm tryin' to get the new range
The reason why I say I'm blowin' real fast

But now I can't do it, I got a positive mind frame
I'm somethin' like spike, I can only do right things

6 years in the game now it's time to go off

Cause finally I got my own damn money
I can't get cut short 'cause I got my own shit
I can't get set back 'cause I own my own shit

I done made it to the start and now I gotta finish
I'm talkin' getting' lil' money but now I'm getting' plenty
Grey Goose, Belvedere, I done bagged off some Henny
And I'm still from the block but don't call me Jenny

Call me baby boy, I'm a Prince of the game
I'm stuck on my money like a pimp with his cane
Take another peek at, my neck and my wrist boy

Six months later now we're big dog status 
Name elevated but I still act average 
Rockin' shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks 
West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest 
French Rivera spot and I am getting in shape man 
I think I'm Super M-a-n without a cape man 
Ridin' all day hustlin', all for the cake man 
I'm a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes 
First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon 
I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans 
I'm a steal every girl ever gon' to fly 
I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops 
Emerald Row is the place where I got my props 
People love me in the hood they don't want me to stop 
So uhh, that's the only way I know how to rock 
And I'm a stay rappers like won't stop 'til I drop 

[Chorus]

I I's Baby Boy and I done it again 
I'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in 'cedes Benz 
Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then 
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent 
Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent 
And they don't question what I say 'cause I'm a ladies pimp 
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes 
And I is represent, my rail room for life 
Money in my pocket but I still act trife 
While I in the club they say the parlor ain't right 
Look I'm--doing great that's the way I feel 
Hustlin' hard all day that's the way I live 

[Chorus]

This the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside 
Red pepper paint must believe my ish ride 
They pause like stop signs when they rollin' up 
Cause' when the doors open up, they open UP 
I'm Lamboin' it I was stashed, off stage I'm throwin' it 
Cause they say I'm like Katrina with money, I blow the shhhh 
Real been gravy, three years out of the eighties 
Solos, shabo's valley animals played it 
Commodores mirages, not the Nike hirages 
It cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this 
Y'all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine 
Don't give me viesels y'all thinkin' this McDonalds size 
I been fly I from the crib to the ride 
Fifty-Four inch screens 26 inches from the ceiling dude 
The plasma look like a projector up in the livin' room homie!

Nigga you muthafuckin' right I'm bout to paint it with stripes,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right it's see-M-are for life,

Before I stop you from playin', with this blat-blat sound,

And ain't no nigga up in this city that can tell me bout mine,
See you blind bruh, talkin' about these diamonds I'm bout to get,

ain't got a DAMNED thing to do with this shit,
See I live here, you live there, we all live fair,

Bomb with a lit wick expression
You here a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit can split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claiming they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they ""Dead Wrong""
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, ""Can't we all just get along""
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Nothing the clip, then give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around
I'm the next best to reach a peak formerly known
As the best keep secret, I guess that I just leaked it

Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice quit talking it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets

Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines

Hands off my property this is not monopoly 
Holdin my girl and she alone can be on top of me 
Some got the chance and they came and made a mockery 
Cats got nervous when they came and said fuckery 
People speculating how they thought I hit the lottery 
Know It's only music but I did my shit properly 
Lyrics contradictory sweet was the victory 
Fools want to duel but they came with manotony 
Use types of metaphors a we run the factory 
Niggas rhymes old like my grandma's crackery 
Why you gettin scared son??? soundin all stuttery 
Fassy like you should have really done battery 
Palms be sweatin and your fingers gettin buttery 
Murderous lyrics through your head for your guttery 
Son your dissin dogs want to study my anatomy 
Cham hit dem hard like mahogony, here we go!!! 

[Chorus:] 
Heading for the top, hit dem when you drop 
Eyes on the prize so you know we can't stop 
Run and tell your pops, better call the cops 
Corny ass mc's lockin up shops 
Heading for the top, hit dem when you drop 
Eyes on the prize so you know we can't stop 
Run and tell your pops, better call the cops 
Corny ass mc's lockin up shops 

[Verse 2:]
It's late for apology here is my analogy 
Your wack cause you did use the wrong terminology 
Get up in your head like I majored in urology 
Way up in your girl cause I studied psyuology 
Fresh technology Baby Cham your prodigy 
Comin to you hard with a new ideology 
New methodology hear the psychology 
Predict a cat's move I use astrology 
Recognize your death fool this is the reality 
Before you come to bat son check the profidology 
Time to be prepared gotta know the technicality 
Listen to the CD and check my vobality 
Styles to your cranium will make you lose your sanity 
Ram up any stadium and never use profanity 
Played at the Palladium and did it all for charity 
Baby Cham big up your nationality, here we go!!!

H-Class rocks from my nose to my toes (woo!)

Baby DC,"Are you feelin' me cause I'm feelin' you?
I was just going to tell you now
You know I want to talk to you  gotta dig me know what I'm sayin?
O.K. you already know that. Ya dig

[Verse 1]
Since the 5th grade, I've been watching you
Even though your friends know I got the hots for you
I know you got boyfriend I'm not knocking yo
But y'all breaking up ain't it possible?
Ever since old days, ya can't give me the time
But when we do hang you always try to give me the rhyme
We used to talk on the phone a lot
I was working on my album that was why I wasn't home a lot
But you never understood when I told you that
It's a shame that me and you had to go threw that
I'm not down for the non-since or the convince 
I'm knowing that you probably have guilty continence
Forget it we can start all over again
I'm mature now and a little older than him
When I bother you
It was only a sign
I'm really feelin you and it's not only a rhyme

Chorus: repeat 2X
I'm feelin you can't you see (Can't you see)
If you want to be down with me 
(That's why I bother you if you like me 
let me know say yes and I'm ready to go) 
oh girl what's it gonna be 
you can work it out with ""Baby DC""

[Verse 2]
All your friends think they older cause they all kissen
But if we were together, it'll be way more different
We could go to Six Flags on a Saturday
Your momma cool but I  don't know what your daddy sa.
I hope he let you go cause he kinda strict
Transportation come on that's a minor lick
Let him know we ain't gonna ride the bus
Matter fact tell him Too $hort driven' us
I'm a win stuffed animals just for you
I'm a ride that ride just for you
I'm a buy cotton candy just for you
Theirs so many things for us to do
We can take a lot if pictures while we there
Just say the word girl and I'll be there
It's not a card game that I'm dealing you
I hope it's real to you cause I'm feelin' you

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Well it's back to reality the point of it all
If you going to stay with him what's the point of it all
I got money and my album to think about
But on the real girl you might want to think it out
Cause I would hate to see you sad if I'm not around
And I would hate to get the word that you got around
And if we never hook up and he still with you
At least you know that I'm feelin you

I'm feelin you can't you see
Can you get with me?
Come and get with D.

Yellow PT Cruiser, yellow 'Lac on rims
Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be makin me moist
Givin me head while she hummin, she can play with her voice
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass
She could ride a dick too, make me cum fast
I like them modelin bitches, I love them swallowin bitches
Where them hoes headed at, I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya

And she ain't like too much of dick 
but give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got family, don't need your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin
All these karats like I'm a fuckin vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, why'all already knowin
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin

Catch 'em so low, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way

Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up

I give you this, give you that what you need love (need love) 
You know I got it holla at me if you need love (need love) 
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection 
Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection 
And you can tell that I ain't trying let you go 
I get with you when I can so that's how I let you know 
And you be tripping 'cause sometimes I gotta go 
But you the first one I holler to right after my shows 
And I was tripping in a sense I was tense 
From my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you 
I gotta get it together say whatever 
But since I met you my life seems so better 

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you can show me 
And the special way I feel when you hold me 
We gon' always be together baby that's what you told me 
And I believe it 
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you can show me 
And the special way I feel when you hold me 
We gon' always be together baby that's what you told me

Baby Dubb,"It was once upon a time not long ago
Lived a little black boy in the middle of the ghetto
Pretty good kid but he always found trouble
Inner city life it ain't hard to find trouble
No income in the home you find struggle
2 years struggling it's no puzzle
He hit the block hard and found him a hustle
Burned the wrong bridge and now he needs muscle
He tried to let it go but the streets don't forgive
I guess they ain't heard of live and let live
But after going round and round he broke it down finally found out
That only god can save him now

[Chorus:]
Save me now, please save me now, save me now, please save me now
I'm on my knees, down at the floor
You're the one I need oh lord
Save me now

I heard the story many times before
Still I'm wondering
How in the world did I get here
And what am I doing
Took the ring and acted like I do
Without the ceremony
Now I got three little ones and I'm
Hurting and I'm lonely
Threw away my dreams when I left school
Now I'm 22 never should've choose him over you

I saw you standing
I started
Started pretending
I knew you
You knew me too
And just like a baby I could not talk
I tried to come close but could not walk

How I just could not get it right
Ooh, next
Next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say

Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name

To write you a letter
But I wanted
To be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey, baby
But just like a Roni you were too shy
But you weren't the only one, so was I
Girl if
We should come close again
I know what I'll say then

One more chance
With you again
I will not let it go

Give me just one more chance

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Baby Face Willette,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Nice lips, nice thighs, nice hips
Pussy tighter then a pair of vice grips
I don't pay niggas, niggas pay me

It's the diamond princess million dollar mistress
From the M-I home of the stop bitches
Christal, and caviar bitches, twist this game for all you fly bitches
I Spit nuttin but the hot shit, you got the four dot get the four dot six
Maybe than you can ride with a hot bitch

End a few careers there it is
But now I'm back on top again
With some red hot shit for you can cop again (Yeah)

Baby Gramps,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,2000

Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a

Fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact

Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers over exaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat

I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

I go to the movie, and I go downtown

Per colpa di 'sto gioco
Adesso faccio yo yo
Prendimi per gioco?

Tu righi dritta mentre una bugia fa un girotondo, fai male
Bruci come le ustioni
Le delusion, promesse non seguite dalle azioni
So come sei fatta
Non ricordo la faccia
Ti cercano in piazza, ti danno la caccia
Ma nessuno poi ti vuole veramente
Sarà per questo che alla fine ognuno mente

Ooh ooh
Quello che si sbaglia si ripaga
Ooh ooh

Tutti che ti cercano ma nessuno ti vuole
Ve-ri-tà
Le persone sono brave solamente a parole
Ve-ri-tà
Per questo ti dicono baby tu sei triste
E sei triste, sei la triste verità

La verità è più bella quando si trucca
La verità ha una sorella più bella che la parrucca
Si chiama bugia ed è una figa
È una brava amica
Ma gli piace attaccare briga
La verità è spesso triste
Un due di picche
Come quando scopri che Babbo Natale non esiste
I ragazzi non la amano, che rogna
Una vita con la testa nella sabbia
O sotto una gonna
Abbiamo tempo per tutto
Tranne ciò che conta
Meglio una verità sporca
O una bella menzogna?
Alle strette
Puoi sempre comprarla
Finché non te la canti, la può fare la carta
E prima o poi
Si dice che lei torna a galla
Beh fatti i cazzi tuoi, tutto apposto se non se ne parla
Non sono santa, neanche peccatore
Io non dico bugie ma verità con più colore

Ooh ooh
Quello che si sbaglia si ripaga
Ooh ooh
Quando suona la campana
Della
Ve-ri-tà, ve-ri-tà
Tutti che ti cercano ma nessuno ti vuole

E sei triste, sei la triste verità!

Ti cercano in piazza ti danno alla caccia
Ooh ooh
E so come sei fatta non ricordo la faccia
Ooh ooh
Ti ho vista in TV ma non so se eri tu
Ooh ooh
Mani su, mani su fai il segno della “V” e grida
Ooh ooh

Tanto siamo già carichi
Due cuori rotti fanno uno buono
Siamo impavidi Entrambi fragili
Se busso forte aprimi
Abbracciami come se tutto questo non ricapiti
Tutte le vie portano a te come Roma
Senza recapiti
Fai cominciare i giochi sadici
Spegniamo i cellulari
Fumiamo come afghani
Versa il Molinari
Ci chiudiamo come origami
Bruciamo i nostri altari, loro

Butta giù l'amaro in due, shots
Uno per tuo padre, due per le cicatrici

Questo è il nostro party
Quello per commiserarci
Io affondo nei tuoi nuovi vecchi abbracci
Spingi i miei tasti
Una dolce melodia
Così triste ed agrodolce da commuovere la tua apatia
Sai amarmi ma non volermi bene
Sei una dolce bugia
Quella più stronza che ci sia
Ci avviciniamo ad un vulcano
E perdiamo la testa
Poi ci lasciamo, affoghiamo nel nulla che resta
Qualcuno spieghi che razza di vita è questa se
Non so stare con te ma non so stare senza
Fiducia è la parola più grande del dizionario, tu sei
Un libro aperto io sono il tuo diario

Anche se non guardo so che mi prenderai

Quando mio padre venne a darmi la notizia
Ormai nulla di speciale è difficile spiegare
La paura non si annuncia mai prima di bussare
Ma tutti quei traslochi da bambina fanno male

E se ci penso non ho avuto mai paura
Ma ciò che vuol dire casa va oltre quattro mura
E ad ogni trasloco salutavo una parte di me
Gli oggetti, gli affetti, un cuore non si crea da se

A scuola sempre quella nuova con l’accento strano
Senza bussola invece il mondo aveva un piano e i ricordi
Come amici e i parenti più lontano seduta al banco immaginando
Mio fratello lì al mio fianco
Ora esito se chiedono chi sono, una vita frammentata in cento mila foto
Chiudere e aprire porte, ricominciare troppe volte
Solo un paracadute e mi sarei sentita forte

Chiudo gli occhi e salto fidandomi di un battito oh oh
Anche se non guardo so che mi prenderai in volo
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

Siamo sopra un filo, noi siamo funamboli
Un filo teso stretto nelle mani degli angeli
E camminiamo sopra a punti interrogativi pregando
Che da questa vita ne usciremo vivi
E il segreto è non guardare giù, ma è guardare in basso
Contare il passo ma non pensarci affatto

Trattengo il fiato e poi mi affiderò al tatto
Trattengo il fiato ancora ad ogni tuo abbraccio
Il tempo tiene il tempo, ballo sul ticchettio
Il problema è che ho dovuto dire troppe volte addio
Paura di abbracciarti poi non sentirti mio
Doverti salutare poi finire nell'oblio

Ciao Ciao
Come ho fatto ai giocattoli e poi le case
Come fanno i lampioni al giorno sulle strade
Non è colpa di mio padre se ho detto ciao a troppi amici
Ricordami come son fatte le radici

Si alzano i centigradi come a Bombay
Sgancio bombe, vienimi a prendere

Col volume a palla e i rosiconi in panca

Senti come suona
A squarciagola

'Cause where I live we have nothing
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto.
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto.

Little kids growing up without no education,
Mom’s on drugs, 'cause that’s her only medication.
Nobody’s home, but they ain’t on a vacation,
But they left the kids alone watching the TV station.
What’s wrong with the picture, please, someone give me the answers
They be wondering why the girls grow up to be dancers
Then we wonder why the boys grow up to be dealers
And they be angry at the whole world ready to kill us.
Aye, after we start to resolve the whole problems
How we let our little children just turn into goblins
Why we got them all killing and stealing and robbing
We need to plan a little seed to prevent the mobbing
Why don’t we teach them that science to reach for the stars?
'Cause they can be defiant with a future worse than ours
Don’t want them looking in the past and covering scars
They need a path out the ghetto, ghetto, hello.

'His little homie wanna grow to be a rhyme slayer,
Little missy wanna grow to be a model
While the momma at home just drinking on the bottle.
Aye, how come little one to grow and be a councilman?
Senator or governor, a mayor politician
Probably 'cause the politicians keep tricking ‘em
Promise that they fixing it but they ain’t really fixing it.
Aye, that’s why they want to be like me
Like Jigga like B and Nicky and Ri
Every day in the ghettos is an emergency
But the powers that be don’t emerge and seek
That’s why you see killing, that’s why you see crimes,
That’s why you see the homies in the prison doing time
That’s why you see crack, that’s why you see blacks trap
With no access out the ghetto, ghetto.

Baby Lemonade,"I wanna float like a halo
The heavy air has kept me on the ground
In other days we did so much
When pleasure was a canvas you could brush
When every whisper seemed to say so much
I'm in a role - I'm a player
And all the other stars are almost gone
And all the friends - you miss the most
Where London Bridges fall or so it goes
The cloudy lanes where Eden was 2 close
In the summer we explore
It makes me sad the advance we never had
Tonight I think the show is over
Somebody please clap your hands
Lights are shining somewhere
Life is going nowhere
Lights are shining somewhere
Life is going nowhere
It's a long drive out to happiness
It's all hills when the tank is filled
With rock & roll
And all that we ever found
We could never really leave the ground
And things you want don't stay around
In the summer we made love
It makes me sad - the chance we never had
Tonight - I think the story's over

And sleep away the days
And traitors are forgiven
The stars align and all the time is gone
And they say its not worth sleeping
After dawn
(I was stuck in a space and time)
If you give me time
Then I'd know what to do
(Loving a heart that was so unkind)
If you were in my shoes
I would wait for you
So long
In the morning we rub our eyes
And see the world outside the sun is just a reminder of all the times
You'd wish that it would fall
We find we're only sleeping after all
I just wanted to give myself
A gift that 1 could use
Then you start your contemplating
It's not a very complicated song
In the darkness we find out
What we hate about ourselves
I try to sleep with the light on
And fade away in the haze of a dying spark
I never know I miss you until its dark",So Long,1998
Baby Lores,"Lo que sentí, fue como un rayo en mi interior
Que me sorprende el corazón
Todo se rompe, todo estalla
Y algo acaba de morir

Para sentir otra manera de ser feliz
Otra de manera de sufrir
Otra manera de vivir
Lo que hasta ayer era reír

Qué pasara, adónde irán mis juegos a parar
Y mi inocencia a terminar
Qué nuevo amor será
Qué tal si me querrá

Qué voy a hacer si dice no
Ya yo no mando al corazón
Qué confusión, qué dicha, qué dolor

Siento al mirar que todo acaba de cambiar
Y veo las cosas para amar
Adiós infancia, ojalá que te recuerde
En mi vejez, con amor

Listening to sounds
Things going off, all around
Kids getting shot
Turn your face to the ground
Hey kids, hey kids stay around
We're not here
We're not here
We're not here to live
Live life for the brawl
Hey kid, we've all got to die
Pick yourself up
Reach for the sky
Hearts full of power
Hearts full of power
Blood's running in and out of my veins
In and out,in and out of my veins
The love, the love comes from inside
The girl is so lovely
So this is for you babe
I'm going to stay true
Because of my love, that's here for you

Sneaking out of school
Looking for something to do
Caught up with the law
You think I'll make it through?
Two kids sitting in local
With my back against the wall
Center of this
It's mister behavior
Waiting to have a brawl

Sneaking out of school
Looking for something to do
Caught up with the law
Do you think I'll make it through?
Sitting in a local
With my back against the wall
Back against the wall
It's mister behavior
Waiting for the brawl

I wake up in the morning
I'm looking at you
I wake up in the morning
I'm looking at you

Playing your love
Knowing I'm there to live life for you
Babe, keep staying true
We're flying through
It will be sad
Living life here without you

We have another toll check
While my dj plays the house decks
See I like the hard age underground
But we're looking for our own sound
Exclude us from the street
We're against what they usually beat
I think it's just a load of drivel
That keeps me hungry and living
Keeping up with a fast pace
Is like some crazy race
I never thought that having a go
I take pistols in the snow
He thinks he's gonna take me
I don't think so

Late night antics
Here we go again
Moving as neighbors
'cause moving is them
Tight t-shirt boys
On their wheels,jeans with those
Forget the cheap thrills
Just walk, just walking the streets
Kids having a go
See it in the face no more
They see us guests,look love

Late night antics
Here we go again

And I give up all this load for some stones

So be careful where you tread

Don't go losing your head

Just remember our love
So you won't give up
If you remember our love
So you won't give up

Long gone are the proper sleeves
To walk by our side
Long killed are the visionary souls
Now we're walking blind

The lies are meant to hypnotize
And put you in a spell
Wake up you sleepy heads

Release yourselves from hell

Then sell us liberty

Try to shut me up
I won't wear your muzzle
Nobody's got my back
I keep it our visual
It's the only way, seems you wanna ridicule
Trials and tribulations
Cross the border through the nations
With your juvenile intentions
Things like our idle expectations
Could you blame us like the famous
We just wanna live like you too
Do what you did to get you through

Devious intentions but its a money making habit
Just a hand to hand transaction
So you might as well just grab it
Station to station 'cause the city never sleeps
Your rhythm driven hard, skips a beat

The weekend's like some kind of Mecca
Slow to come round those lips so wait quicker
48 hours there ain't nothin' much better to do
Than to mess up and get back together
You drink your poison for personal pleasure
Anticipation to arouse your own pleasure
But my force remains the same
Over a billion in making change

Can turn silver into gold, fat into grass

I'm bound to pass

They said I was the weapon
They stand up in the place with the D on my cap

To the top, but nothing less
While you'd be bidding in your staple nest
You're just bugging so why don't you give it a rest

Cuando te miro se me para el tiempo,
Buscando siempre la manera,
Pero nunca me sale y es que me quema,
Esto que llevo dentro
Y es que me pone tierno
Y no lo puedo controlar.
Ay ay ay ah

Diselo Baute!

Y es que mi vicio eres tu y no lo puedo cambiar,
Es que he ido a psiquiatra psicólogo y demás,
Todos coinciden en lo mismo estoy fatal,
Y es que mi cura tu la tiene bien guarda.
Estoy pensando asegurar mi corazón
Por si se para cuando me diga que no,
Es que tan solo con mirarte caminar,
Es como un chute de algo que no se me va.

Y créeme que lo intento,
Pero tu cuando te pones con tu pelo suelto,
La testosterona sube por todo mi cuerpo,
Imposible de parar
Como una fuerte racha de viento.

Y me pone, esto que llevo dentro
Y es que me pone tierno
Y no lo puedo controlar

Por eso te quiero yo te decir a ti bombón,
Que no te voy a dejar ir,
Que yo para ti seria como la luz de sol,
Me pongo y vuelvo a salir,
Así que coge la maleta que nos vamos a ir de aquí

Y si hace falta yo te pongo un piso en Triana,
Con vistas al rio Guadalquivir, mira solo para ti.
Yo me gasto mis ahorros y te llevo a pasear,
Tu serias mi princesa, yo el ladrón de Alibaba.

Ahí va con carita de princesa,
No te dejes embaucar si te coge ya no te suelta,
Te absorbe como si fueras un flan,
Te mete en sitios caros
Que tu nunca podrás pagarás las deudas,
De colgantes y de fiestas,
Le gusta el Glamour y que siempre pagues tu.

Y ahora estoy aquí todo tirado,
Sin ganas de nada y sin un pavo,
Y es que esta tía a mi no me ha dejado,
Ni la cartila pa sellar el paro.

Talkin' lot, til I spray dumpin' ? niggas
Whenever talkin' shit, I straight rip 'em
And niggas know I come equip when I whip them

You say how can I make these dirty raps
Number one albums, back to back
If it was 1950, do you think I sell, no
They probably throw me straight to jail
I tell you life just ain't what it used to be
Between you and me, exclusively
Everybody's changed, were losing our minds
The government won't help, cause they refuse to find
A solution to the problems of the inner streets
Its a shame what our kids are beginning to be
Pregnant teenagers, young gun slangers
There ain't no love, there ain't nothin' but anger
We don't go to church and can't pray in school
Listen real close to what I'm sayin' fool
I know kids who went to school together
Now they all grown up, tryin' to kill each other
Shootouts on the playground is where it goes down
But back in the day, we rode the merry-go-round
And some little kid might shoot me tonight
And I always used to wonder what the future be like
Curse words on the TV and radio
You want to see sex, turn it on HBO
Late at night, you see women freak women
Sex sale, that's why I keep pimpin'
I grew up in the 70s', somethin' like Crooklyn
But I was in Cali not Brooklyn
I could tell the whole world was going crazy
But it really didn't happen til the 80s'
With free basin and smokin' crack
A lotta people learned not to joke with that
Streets flooded, with homeless folks
Whole families, lives gone up in smoke
We're all related to a crackhead
Sometimes I wake up in the mornin' and want to go back to bed
Layin' these thinkin' bout things
About the way life change
How women used to like to wear decent clothes
Now they curse like men and dress like hoes
You supposed to be a virgin til you marry
But teenage girls find it normal to carry a baby
Babies havin' babies
Rappers like me always disrespectin' ladies
Wonder why its like that, well so do I
But I just turn my back and then I go get high
Cause I get paid real good to talk bad about a bitch 
And you bought it, so don't be mad I got rich
Ask your grandparents, is life the same
Man thangs change

There used to be a time when old folks were respected
Kids talkin' back was never accepted
Get spanked and your mouth got washed out with soap
But kids nowadays will curse out old folks
Then you tell me I need to be a role model
And get these babies off the 40ounce bottles
But I'm not the one who made alcohol legal
Liquor stores on every corner that's why we go
Buy 40 ounces and go get drunk
Don't respect our kids, like no good punks
And then they grow up to be hardcore criminals
Shoot 'em up, slang dope always pimpin hoes
I know its those that don't believe what I'm sayin on the mic right
So Baby D won't you tell them what its like

Its kinda hard comin' up as a youngster
Gotta deal with the roof that I'm under
Even though my moms got it hard
My daddy passed away, now I'm stuck without a father
But times have changed bro
I never ever seen Santa Claus comin' through the ghetto
But you know what I always see
I always see the white man robbin' the black man back G
And I don't even get in trouble for it
And I don't see nothin' forward
Always tryin' to beat the black man to death
Punk police want to hide behind your badge
Always tryin' arrest somebody
All we gotta do is beat him with the billy club
Here I come, I comin' with my gun
I'm shootin' in the head police now what

I tell you life is too short for it to be like that
We gotta be leaders, can't follow the pack
With all them fiends in the streets smokin' crack
What you give life is what it gives you back
Cause money in the ghetto ain't nothin' new
But when you get the money gotta know what to do
Buy you a business or buy you a house
Just so the police can't wipe you out
I heard it in the streets, they say you the man
So try to help your brothers and lend a helpin' hand
Now what we gone do

We came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
I said we came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
Now run up and get gun up the slack black
I'm hittin' blackjack in the casino when I mack slap
What you want to play like Al Pacino with this
Type of style with the lyricist this funk of hits
And the biscuits I drop
Motherfuckers know I come down and show me ?
I don't really care
From the front or the rear
Word to your mother I'm bout to smother and smear
Its that master all I intelligent
Chain that I swing from the others is irrelevant

Its Malik and I freak it's obsolete

If, if, if, if, if...
If you ever change your mind
Only turn back the hands of time
Cross my heart and hope to die
I don't want to see you cry
I don't want to see you cry
Can't take place its not to fair
I know for you it's much to bear
When you're drowning in despair
Just know I'll always be right there
Right there, right there, right there...
(Verme...) No, no, don't want no more
Maybe you're gonna regret it someday
You feel that you'd be better off
But it's still your loss
And you know it, take it
Take it as a loss
You'll regret, the very thing
When you just up and left
You can act you're better off
But it's still your loss
You'll regret it, regret, regret

No será fácil olvidarte de mí
Yo te hice feliz, lo sabes, lady
_________,baby, te quiero a ti
No pienses que yo iré por ti
Now you're calling, you're feeling lonely
Hoy sentirás lo que yo sentía por ti
Se que hay un dolor why un vacío muy dentro de ti
Pero fue lo que decidiste, lady
Que quieres de mí, recuerda de que al fin
Arrepentida vuelves tú aquí
Necesitas verme why regresas por mí
Se que te mueres por mi...
No puedes olvidarme...
Estoy en tu piel...
Lo sabes bien...
No quieres perder...
Ni un minuto sin mí ser...
Arrepentida estas, no finjas mas ...
Verme no quieres mas, why tal vez...
Te arrepentirás, yo se...
Serás tu quien perderás...
Serás tú, tú lo sabes...
Verme no quieres mas, why tal vez...
Te arrepentirás, yo se...
Serás tu quien perderás...

Everybody need to take time to reflect
Take time to put things in prespect
Soon as you realize
And start to regret

and get a better hope
and get a better hope

Suéltate hasta que salga el amanecer

Y en la piscina o el jacuzzi te voy a morder
Porque eres mía, yo te voy a ser mi mujer

Habrá consecuencias si sabes tratarme como una princesa
Te daré el poder para hacer lo que quieras

Créeme que yo no te fallaré
Yo te amaré, contigo yo no jugaré
Dame noches para llenarlas de placer
Que contigo voy a toa para besarte en la boca

Un beso uoh uoh uoh
Un beso que no he podido borrar
De mi mente por más que ha pasado el tiempo
Y desde que tú y yo nos conocemos
En tus labios no paro de pensar
Por eso yo te pido una noche más

Solo quiero un beso de esos que me vuelva loco
Y que me mate, que me mate
Lo que hicimos quiero que se repita una vez más
Una más, una más, una más, una más

Quiero un beso de esos que me vuelva loco
Y que me mate, que me mate
Lo que hicimos quiero que se repita una vez más
Una más, una más, una más, una más

Quiero que se repita y como la primera vez
Que te di la visita
Y te pude robar un besito de esa boquita
Desde ahí eres mi favorita
Y hasta mi corazón diferente palpita

Usted me puede ocupar si me necesita
A cualquier hora yo le llego señorita
No deje pa' mañana lo que puedas hacer ahorita
Dame de esos besitos que a cualquiera resucitan

Tú me tienes mal de la mente
Estoy loco por tenerte en mi cama
Cuando quieras que te caliente
Sabes que tú cuerpo me llama

Un beso de esos que me vuelva loco
Y que me mate, que me mate
Lo que hicimos quiero que se repita una vez más
Una más, una más, una más, una más

Quiero un beso de esos que me vuelva loco
Y que me mate que me mate
Lo que hicimos quiero que se repita una vez más
Una más, una más, una más, una más

Una vez más un beso que me enamore
Con esos labiecitos así como los pone
Pa' hacerte el amor en diferentes versiones
Y desquitarme contigo estas obsesiones

Dentro de mi cuarto me tienes volando mami
Por to' lo alto quisiera volverte a besar
No sabes cuanto estoy pensando en ti desde que me levanto
Nunca pensé que fuera pa' tanto

Tú me tienes mal de la mente
Estoy loco por tenerte en mi cama
Cuando quieras que te caliente
Sabes que tu cuerpo me llama

Un beso de esos que me vuelva loco
Y que me mate que me mate

Ropa interior de seda (Duro)
Se recoja el pelo con la diadema se pone caliente
Tremendo problema (Frontua)
Marca el compás y preparo el esquema
Yo pongo el cinema tiene mucha calle me encanta su sistema

Baby Rasta,"Los Vaqueros, luchando por esto que llamamos vida
Vivimos día a día con mucha gallardía
Y demostrando siempre la hombría
Ser un vaquero no es coger un arma y sentirte más que nadie
Un vaquero respeta para que lo respeten,
No importando el ni el tamaño ni el corillo con que se encuentre el otro
Un vaquero siempre mantendrá la cabeza en alto
Porque esta claro en su andar
Muchos por ahí vociferan que son vaqueros y que son esto y lo otro
Pero mira mejor aprenda de los que saben de esto
Déjese llevar por los que le dan consejos para bien
Y no de aquellos que ponen un arma en sus manos para que le tire a un hermano
No sea un monigote, demostremos la inteligencia de defender la razón
Recuerden que cuando la verdad llega, la mentira baja la cabeza
Hago un llamado a que se respete a la familia,
A que no se le esté tirando a esos carros,
Que las mujeres o niños van monta'o
A nadie le gustaría pasar por eso
Para ser un vaquero te hace falta corazón
Para decir las cosas tal cual y siempre cumplir con tu palabra
Y éste que les voy a presentar es el líder de los vaqueros
Wisin, te habla tu amigo Gavilan
Despertando conciencia en los vaqueros
Doble U que dejen la nebula
Que saben que les tenemos el ojo clavao

¡doble U! Okay, los vaqueros llegamos, ustedes toditos temblaron
Hablaron, roncaron pero nunca me pararon, cambiaron
Quisieron medir fuerzas conmigo y se estrellaron
Hice un llamado y los duros del género se reportaron
En verdad los don ustedes no aguantan mi presión
No me hables de dinero ni de proyección
Movimientos millonarios de nación a nación,
Los que conocen la operación los vaqueros de expedición
De inmediato, liricamente esto es un maltrato
Y estaba pa rato seguimos en el liderato,
Ustedes huelen a envidia me lo dice el olfato
Midiendo fuerzas pelagatos yo tengo los campeonatos

La marash
Del aeropuerto al concierto tengo todo self
Cierro todo allí luego regreso al jet
Prendo un blon en el aire que el piloto dice oh shit
Y al bajarme del avión me monté en un corvette
Ando fuera de control parezco una epidemia
Tengo tanto Flow que puedo abrir una academia
Y enseñarte a vestir y enseñarte a rapiar
Todo me queda bien aunque en verdad me quede mal
Cuidado con lo que hablan o vayan a hablar
Hasta a Pablo lo mataron, aquí nadie es inmortal (Escobar)
Los rifles del pana mío están locos por disparar
Y si te dan, no te salvan en el hospital
Prrrra
Causan heridas difícil de ver,
Profundo ni un sastre te puede coser
Mala mía es que ya los mató sin querer
Pero si no los mato como mi familia va a comer

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh)
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedoo

Seguimos frescos, sacados de la caja
El princi
El cerebro
El mueka, brrr
Saliendo pa fuera, Jordan en piel de pantera
Dicen Cosculluela a veces exagera
Intachable, nunca me han declarado culpable
Y bajar al nivel de ustedes ya no es negociable
Marica, los oyeron lo certifican
Diamantes en mi Rolex ya parecen canicas
Es inmenso el motor en el Ferrari menso
Tu no me vas a alcanzar en un Mercedes Benz
El piquete, el águila tras el billete
En sociedad con el tirao negro del doblete
Rapero estás escuchando el verdadero,
Cosculluela comandando Los Vaqueros

Ajustame el audífono que esto es pa los vaqueros
Si hay que romper el micrófono
Leyendo lo que escribo en la nota de mi telefono
Ya soy un icono, apuntandoles el rostro como blancos de polígonos
'Toy pensando que yo vengo en la fe del piloto
Lambe escroto de ese rostro te vo a sacar el poroto
Ay ma, que el lugar teniente cambien el sendero
La sociedad del dinero y yo matando en los vaqueros
Siente el rantantan fue que volvió el animal dale siguelo
Con los de Guayaquil te la vo a busca
Ya yo estoy aquí no me voy a salir
Quien me va a sacar si como yo no hay
Así que no lo intentes
Porque quedarás con daños permanentes

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo
Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Andan vociferando de que pistolean
Que me darán muerte donde yo me vea
Quisiera ver tu cara cuando me meta tu aldea
Y le limpie la cacharra al frente tuyo al más que mea
Dímelo Wisin llegaron los vaqueros del futurum
Fue casi de seguro brincaran como canguro
Pendejo operaciones millonarias decisiones
Un quimico fresco pa hacer temblar las naciones
Bajando al enemigo del caballo a lo Billy The Kid
Un solo fantasmeo y doble U no salen de aquí
Fuego pa ti te va a caer cuando me activar
Los vaqueros tienen calibre y rompen al que se la vive

Yo los he visto como ladran, como se crecen en un par de meses
Pero cuando explota el peo, se desaparecen
Vociferan que son líder, roncan que son los killer
Se meten un par de pepas y los pasos no los miden
El miedo les falla el pulso, hacer calle ya no hay pulso
Vaqueros tamo aquí so que controlen los impulsos
Y los requisitos son hay que tener cojones,
No hablar mierda en las canciones, 'tar ready pa las misiones
Y se monta too el mundo, se respeta al que respete
Yo estoy en la calle desde que pito tenia grillete
Yo te la traigo como eco eco seo pa que llegue
Si no te mando a los dementes pa que de una te frenen
Dile Wisin que yo si que soy real,
Que yo no fantasmeo, que yo si soy un anormal
En moto seca a trabajar, los bajo el palo sin hablar
Dile jordán el significado de ser leal (Se reporta el menor)

Enmascarao como el Zorro, ando solo soy el Horrellender
Los enemigos me ven, se las ponen y gritan danger
Blindao de negro completo, abran paso llegó Darth Vader,
Batman siempre fue el mejor por eso nunca fue un Avenger
Vaqueros llegó pancho villa, me encanta el protagonismo
De que van a roncarme a mi cabrones de lo mismo
Ya yo estoy acá arriba sigue subiendo la cuenta
De aquí yo los espero con Las toro bajo cuentas
Me dicen Kevin Durant el 35 de los thunder
Por que sin mi la giny sin coger ni un solo conver
Esto no es Toy Story buddy agarrate el sombrero
Que el menor no está jugando, preguntale a los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

¡pusho!
Hoy cambiamos la history no tuve que engancharme en la fory,
Porque ando con 10 vaqueros y no son los de toy story
Reverencia tranquilo, abranle paso al pupilo
Que en estilo me lo tasaron este un millón de kilos
Tanto file, las tarjetas negras no me da decline
Yo nunca pierdo aunque me vaya Cinco veces over time
Tamos a lo fucker llenando hasta los estadios de soccer
El acto principal muchachos, volvió Paul Walker
Doble U me dijo que rompa
Que yo soy la A porque se come alas compás
Matando a estos rajeros que se meten en todos los agujeros
Soy el único novato rompiendo en los vaqueros

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa su entierro que andamos a fuego
Y somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego aquí no hay miedo

Tumbe esa cara de misterio,
Hagan planes pa su entierro que andamos a fuego
Y somos los vaqueros

Lo que tú acabas de rozarme al acercarte

Ven y empieza por quererme y respetarme
Entiéndeme que soy como un diamante
Que no en cualquier parte se encuentra
Habrá consecuencias si sabes tratarme como una princesa
Te daré el poder para hacer lo que quieras

Créeme que yo no te fallaré
Yo te amaré, contigo yo no jugaré
Dame noches para llenarlas de placer
Que contigo voy a toa para besarte en la boca

No pienses que estoy con otra
No quiero que pasen horas mami, tú te me demoras
El miedo a ti te ahoga
Luchar para reír, luchar para llorar
Luchar para que tú me des una oportunidad

Sé que te fallé, espero que no sea muy tarde
Maí, nunca tú y yo nos vamos a entender
Yo quiero lo mejor para ti, mujer
Entiendo que ya yo te fallé
No quiero seguir maltratándote

Y voy a darte una oportunidad
Boy, demuéstrame que tú eres todo un hombre y no un boy
Te doy mi atención o me voy
Boy, convénceme que tú eres lo que buscaba
Y voy a darte la oportunidad
Boy, demuéstrame que de verdad tú no entrarías en mi cama

También sé que piensas en mi solo necesito que digas
Cuándo aquí yo te estaré esperando
Dime cuándo dame una oportunidad

Dale ven a mi yo te hago olvidar
No ves que estoy loco por ti y no te dejas llevar
El otro te da sufrimiento y te hace llorar
Sólo tienes que buscarme yo te doy tu lugar

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

See when we come through we got nuf shit to flaunt

Hit you with the heat is that what you really want?

y'all niggas want to test my squad, I doubt it doubt it
All that murder talk, gun talk, you talk, I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Nigga feel my vibe niggas see my vision 
P-why-P nigga play your position
I fuck up this game and make the ref' blow the whistle 
My squad be the official, clique in this rap shit
Diss me on the record and watch, you get your ass kicked
Catch me on Church Ave, flickin blunt ashes

[Rah Digga]
Crazy, thinkin I can't rock buttas
won't take shit without no type floders
Hectic, Rah on the ill dialect shit
Deliveries harder then girls in obstectrics
Ready to stay on 
Smoother then rayon
Takin' out niggas and all they liaisons 
Mu'fuckas, black out season 
Publishing resume steady increasing

Sayonara, send my rivals, slam a guy, 
Be damned if I
Had to tell one, tell a lie, get paralyzed 
Stay payed, rock shit made in ultra suede 
Switch blade yo wack act back to first grade 
Even if y'all never seen us you know y'all need us
Suck my penis from here to muthafucking venus
Think back when you was amazed and had to sit back 
Imagining me ending your world like Deep Impact
Blood clot, watch me come through and bust a gunshot
Yeah people, come inside of your dance and done that

Motherfucker still drunk off'a Bacardi and lime

Patch his body with gauze
Mop up the floors
Splatter nigga's blood on the walls

Blow that nigga's family up just for fronting

(Spliff Star)
Yo where the bitch that was with the nigga?

(Rah Digga)
Caught her with the left
Choked her by the halter, bitch bloody to death
Then the ho starts crying 'bout her hair and nails
Gettin' stomped with the shells...

(Rampage)
...I heard the bitch-nigga yell
Caught Peter, man, by the speaker
Looked me in the eye and didn't even know
I was his brother's keeper
Slap the nigga, through him in the sleeper

(Spliff Star)
Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

(Baby Sham)
Chill, let's bounce
Spliff is high on 'bout a half an ounce
If he's hiding, we gon' find him on the eye of a needle

(Rah Digga)
Yeah that's the shit I'm talking bout
Let's go fuck with his peoples
Nigga got a sister?

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah, she work up in Kids World

(Spliff Star)
There the nigga goes, let's hit him with the 4-5 chrome

(Baby Sham)
Chill Spliff, we gon' trail this nigga's bitch ass home
Rush the crib

(Rah Digga)
Kill the bitch while she ain't even looking
Still all fucked up from the last ass-whuppin
Chop the bitch up

(Baby Sham)
Caught up in this foul mix-up
Tore wide open, bitch'll need a major stitch-up
Dig a ditch up where no blood-hound'll sniff up

(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, bury that bitch, don't leave a scent for dogs to pick up

(Rampage)
Oh shit, yo I hear somebody coming 
>From the upstairs bathroom where I hear the water running

Fuck that! There the motherfucker go right there
I want a morgue for him, make that nigga's crew pall-bear
Yo let me lift him

(Rah Digga)
Wait, before that, let me go kiss him

(Spliff Star)
Put five in his head and wrap him in the bedspread
Fled from the scenery without nobody seeing me

You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

[Chorus]
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you movin for.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

[Chorus]

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.
Now we coppin' platinum things.
Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.
Ramp's the rugged MC.
My squad keeps growin.
Where you think you goin.'

Chief gunnin' to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.
Now low muscles moves.
Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.
Son gets school, wit the dummin' crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn
Like James Evans when I'm blowin'.
Fuck is wrong wit cha.

Where you think you're goin'.
Where you think you're goin'.

Will you serenade me with the song you used to play?

Will you hold me?

'Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep

Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
'Cause I just need your song

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

If we hear a trip in the aisle
Turn on the lights with a big smile
There's no beautiful child
It's tealeaves with the roof tiles

Tune into paradise on the long wave
For a millionth time a born again song
Rings out like a bad shave

Babybird,"What is this beautiful thing we've found
It's so shiny, bright & round
So I went into town
And bought a little patch of ground
And I put a shop on top
And bought myself some stock
Oh, my little cornershop
Oh, my little cornershop
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my little store on the green
Where everything is fine
Where everything is fine
So fine
I found some corrugated steel
And banged it to the window with my heel
And now nobody's going to get in
After half past ten in the evening
In the evening...
Oh my 2nd little
Oh my 3rd little
Oh my 4th little...cornershop
Oh my 5th little

Babybird,"Take me in your arms again
Wash me in your eyes
Tie me to the house again
Love me 'till love dies
Blame me for everything
Not just the bad times
Whispering sweet nothings in your ear
Just like a dead bird sings
Look into my face again
Between us there's a mile
I can see a hole in the sky
As wide as your smile
As wide as your smile
It's not that you've gone away
It's that I've never met you
But I wish you'd come back to me

Just like the night turns blue
Just like a dead bird sings
Love me 'till love dies

Three years later you're underground

You came into my head
I tried to touch you, I tried to kiss you,
I couldn't wake you up

My rusty nails stuck to you like glue
My arms around you like audio tape

It's not rude

Wanna get crude
It's not filthy
It's not lewd
I wanna get famous just so I can get sued
Guess who's my girlfriend, yeah, ten out of ten
Yeah it's Jesus, she's my girlfriend
Want to know who my boyfriend is,
No, nought out of ten
Jesus ain't a man, she's my girlfriend
Jesus is my girlfriend
It's not drink, It's not food
It's a man in a shuttle with a tube
I can't fly, so what, I can't cook
Can't even catch a tune with a hook
I've been to Hong Kong & South Dakota
In a little wood plane without a motor
Got a girl in bed, when I took it further
Where Jamaica? No I coaxed her. Ha! Ha!
I love her
My girlfriend
I love her

",Jesus Is My Girlfriend,1996
Babybird,"Way up in the clouds
Angels don't fly
Big silver birds
Re-writing the sky
Taxi & take off now
I close your eyes
Look out of the window
Watch the ground die
I live all day-to vacate the place-I love-uh huh
I work all day-to leave the way I live-behind
Way down on the ground
People don't fly
But here we at the airport
Like ladybirds in July
Just like back home
I wish that you were here
If I had a cellular phone
I'd drown it in my beer
I was once like you
Dreaming you were me
Locked inside your pretty head
Wishing I was free
But I was so different then
And you were roughly the same
Love was in your pretty head
And sex was on my brain

With a handful of rusty nails

Tries to wash him off in the shower

And I'd n-n-n-n-never let you fall

Don't cry, it's over now
Don't sigh, things are better now
I will give you everything you need
You can always count on me

Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'm gonna teach this world a lesson
And I'm n-n-n-n-never gonna let you fall

Babyface,"Let's be romantic baby
Let's stay in love

When I think of the magic
And all that it means to me girl
Girl I get so, so excited
Thinking of love and all it's possibilities
And to think of the madness
So many broken homes, so many broken hearts
Well baby that won't be you and me
Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we're boundless through time

Let's be romantic baby
Let's be the ones who stay in love
Let's make a promise
Let's stay in love

Just to think of us is magic
It's such a sweet melody
Baby, afraid that we don't abuse it
For darling a love like this to go so easily
Oh to think of the sadness
So many hearts all day are lost and torn apart
Baby that won't be you and me
Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we'll last through all time

[Hook]
Let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
All we gotta do is just keep it up
Keep on giving up my love
Let's show the world that we're still in love
One love is greater than all

Let's be, let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
Let's be the ones
Let's stay in love

Let's be, let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
Come on my sugar
Love, hey yeah

Let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
All we gotta do is just keep it up
Keep on giving up my love
Let's show the world that we're still in love
One love is greater than all

Babyface,"First, there is no doubt
Not for a minute
You've always been my heart's
Number one and number two
Girl, you were right there
And I won't forget it
By my side for all those nights
I had to hold on to you

If there's one thing that I know
Girl, you are my heart and soul
When I needed love indeed
You were always there for me

And I'll make love stay
Till my dying day
And it really makes me feel good
Just to say

After all that we've been through
It's so nice to know someone like you
Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
You're my kinda girl

Now I know
That nothin' could separate us
You'll always be my girl
I will always be your man
We go as far
As love's gonna take us
To the room of love we'll zoom
Long as we're hand in hand

If there's one thing that I know
Girl, I'll always love you so
When I needed love to be
You were always there for me

And I'll make love stay
Till my dying day
And it really makes me feel good
Just to say

After all that we've been through
It's so nice to know someone like you
Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do?
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
You're my kinda girl

After all that we've been through oh baby
It's so nice to know someone like you
Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
You're my kinda girl
My kinda girl
My kinda girl

I get a real good feelin'
Deep inside my soul
Girl, when you're around
I just lose control
And I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout the way I feel
Girl, you are the only one
That gives me chills
And I can't stop lover
'Cause you mean too much
Ooh I start to lose it, girl
Whenever we touch
We got too much time
And that's for sure
We need to stay together
And never let go, no

My my my my my my my my my my kinda girlie
You're my kinda girl, you're my kinda girl
'Cause you're my kinda girl

After all that we've been through
It's so nice to know someone like you
Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
You're my kinda girl
My kinda girl
You're my kinda girl

After all that we've been through oh baby
It's so nice to know someone like you
