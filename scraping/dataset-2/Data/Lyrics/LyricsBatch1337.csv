Bon Jovi,"I should have seen it coming when the roses died
should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
And baby, ain't it funny, how you never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
but only fools are 'know-it-alls' and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at The Masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
Now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving, oh

If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song",This Ain't a Love Song,1995
Bon Jovi,"I was walking around, just a face in the crowd,
trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear Styrofoam crown,
wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner, singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare, these days

She came looking for some shelter with a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard,
guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples an all the `wanna be's`
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days the stars seem out of reach
These days there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, love don't last in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly
From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy he said momma ""I've got to try""
Don't you know that all my heroes died
And I guess I'd rather die than fade away

These days the stars seem out of reach
But these days there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing last in this graceless age
Even innocence has caught the morning train
And there ain't nobody left but us these days

I know Rome's still burning
Though the times have changed
This world keeps turning round and round and round and round,
These days

These days the stars seem out of reach
But these days there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
Even innocence has caught the morning train
And there ain't nobody left but us these days

These days the stars seem out of reach
These days there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts
There ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
There ain't nobody left but us these days",These Days [Multimedia Track],1995
Bon Jovi,"Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch
Just half-past noon, trying to figure out just what he's doing
Why he had to grow up so soon
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?
There's got to be some way out of here
He says, ""Man, this life is cruel""

I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life
She changed her name, her face
Because the grass looked greener on the other side
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night
Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I want everything

I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything
It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything, all I want is everything

My next door neighbor Donnie
Died in his room just the other day
His brother come home
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein

Cops come down with a body bag
They said Donnie was a casualty
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out
He couldn't handle reality

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I want everything

I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything
It's my life Mr. I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything, all I want is everything
",All I Want Is Everything [*],1995
Bon Jovi,"We met some time ago when we were almost young
It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from 
I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes

I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied

Your love was my salvation it could always get me high 
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine

I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes 
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat 
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel

Just like everything good love has to die 
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye

Your love was my salvation it could always get me high 
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine

Just like everything good love has to die 
No one even cried we were one of a kind

Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine

Your love was my salvation it could always get me high 
You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine",Bitter Wine [*],1995
Bon Jovi,"Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new.

Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wonderin', what in the world did I do?
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you.

Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you",Crazy [*],1995
Bon Jovi,"Heaven help the child who never had a home,
Heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall,

Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day,
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away.
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl,

Bon Jovi,"You didn't have to love me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did 
And I thank you 
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 

If you took your love to someone else 
I know what I meant to be the loving dare 
You made me feel like I've never felt

But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 
You didn't have to hold me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 

Now every day there's something new 
You put your make-up and your mild perfume 
You got me trying to do things, too 
Just so that I can keep up with you 

You didn't have to shake me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 
You didn't have to make me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 

All my life I've been short changed 
Without your love it would be a crying shame 
Now I know what love I'm looking for 
When they say they're being turned on 

I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you 
Thank you, baby, thank you, thank you I got to say

Let me thank you, baby, baby I've got something to say 

Thank you baby 
Let me count the ways, for the whole wide world to hear, oh yeah 
Now thank you for paying for my cold beer 
I wanna thank you for being here with me baby

Thank you for giving me your best friend's phone number 
Thank you for understanding, that me and your sister are just good friends.",I Thank You [*],1995
Bon Jovi,"When I look in your eyes I can feel the fire.

I was there like your mother
Like a brother, like a friend
Said you'd be there like a heartbeat
Thought I'd be there 'till the end
Then you took me like a cancer
You turned my conscience black
Tell the cops""here keep the ransom""
'cause there's no turning back

So if you want to bleed me honey,

Bon Jovi,"Hey God, I'm just a little man
I got a wife and family
I almost lost my house
I bought into the dream
We're barely holdin' on and I'm in way too deep
We're two paychecks away from livin' out on the street

She's a workin' single mom
Like a saint she don't complain
She never says a word but she thinks that she's to blame
Her son just got convicted
He blew some cop away
She did her best to raise him but the world got in the way

I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me

Just a happy child playin' beneath the summer sun
A vacant lot's his playground
By 12 he's got a gun

Spit on his own grave
Was he too gone to save
Or did you even know his name
Are you the one to blame

Hey now, I guess the night's just bringing me down

I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now)

The only one who knows my middle name 
And the smiles, they came easy 'cause of you (hey now) 
You know that I love you, but I hate you 
'Cause I know I can never escape you 
So let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark (hey now) 
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud? 

There's no love, there's no hate

Maybe I haven't said enough

Maybe I've lost my guts

Bon Jovi,"You know your favorite old pair of shoes
The ones with the hole in the toe you won't lose
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used
But still you love to play when your feeling blue

That faded rose that's all dried out
Those Bukowski poems we couldn't live without
Your high school picture when you had wild hair
That stormy day on the beach that got us here

Oh, you better believe there's just one thing you need
Oh can't you see?

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams, it's just me baby

Just like a shadow 10 feet tall
Standin' right behind you should you fall
I'll be the one to hold you up to walk
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl

And if your waves should ever break at sea
I'll be there waitin, I'm that sandy beach
I'm that same old dog, scratchin' those same fleas
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

It's just me baby

If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

If there's one more thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

It's just me baby

What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me

Lookin' shiny new, feelin' really strong
You can tell him that I'll tell him, he can just move on

I didn't come this far to throw the towel in 
I didn't fight this hard to walk away

It's just because the words got in the way

I was you and you were me 
We were more than just the same

I hated you, 'cause I couldn't love myself 
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me

In the bathroom by the sink 
Trying to write the right words down

Bon Jovi,"I got my call light on 
Gimme one more fare tonight 
Just get me over the bridge 
I can see those shiny bay lights 
You know I'm never alone 
But I'm feeling lonely tonight 
Damn, I got my last cigarette 
But I ain't got not light 

God let these wheels roll 
To where the girls are pretty 
When the nights explode 
And life is still living 
Down this open road 
The arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

In my rear view mirror 
I see someone else's hairline 
I hear that fire in your eyes 
Is on the rock and doing hard time 

And the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine 
There's wine in this dirt 
Here love ain't love 
It's just another four letter word 

God let these wheels roll 
To where the girls are pretty 
When the nights explode 
And life is still living 
Down this open road 
The arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

Now that cold gray fog's 
Just a rolling down the highway 
He's come to carry me home 
It's put a little smile on my face",Little City,1997
Bon Jovi,"The kids 'round here look just like sticks
They trade old licks with a beat up six
I just smile and catch the groove

Gothic girls all dress in black
Serious as heart attacks
It takes a little bit of getting used to

The old man with the whiskey stains
Lost the night forgot his name
His poor wife will sleep alone again
And it ain't hard to understand
Why she's holding on to her own hand

No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir

I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive
Seems her chauffeur took a dive
And sold her secrets to the sun
And later in a magazine
I finally figured what it means
To be a saint, not a queen

Two lustful lovers catch a spark
And chase their shadows in the dark
Someone's getting off tonight
Of a big red bus that's packed so tight
It disappears in a trail of light
Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right...

It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea

No one's asking me to bleed
I'm the man i want to be
When chelsea girls sing...

It's morning when i go to sleep
In the distant dawn a church bell rings
Another day is coming on
A baby's born, an old man dies
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye
I leave my soul and just move on
And wish that i was there to sing this song

Knocked me clean off my feet 
Her tongue kept on selling 
What any blind man could see 
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs

The soul with holes ain't gonna be the one you lose

Do you remember me? 
When I hit the streets I was 17 
A little wild, a little green 

I've been up and down and in between 
After all these years 
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream 
But I ain't looking over my shoulder

I like the bed I'm sleeping in 
It's just like me, it's broken in 
It's not old -- just older 
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans 
This skin I'm in it's alright with me 
It's not old -- just older 

It's good to see your face 
You ain't no worse for wear 
Breathing that California air 
When we took on the world 
When we were young and brave 
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave 
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder

But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes 
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff 
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose 

Well, I look in the mirror 
I don't hate what I see 
There's a few more lines staring back at me

Bon Jovi,"I couldn't sleep
Took a walk down Second Avenue

Sick of dreaming dreams that never come true
One way street and I know where its leading to
There's a ""For Sale"" sign on the front door of the city hall
The subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
I could take a hit but I don't want to take the fall

That's just one side of the story
In this two story town

It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old ship going 'round
I'm going down, down ,down, down, down
It's a two story town

There's a girl that I sleep with
She's got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
And I kissed them both goodbye

Seven days of Monday morning
In a two story town

It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
It's the same old ship going 'round
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
It's a two story town

One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are calling me out

And me I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never going to find me in the lost and found

It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
It's the same old ship going 'round

Guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets
Call me for a wild time

So you sit home alone
'Cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows
Left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights
At night on the neon Broadway signs
And she don't really mind
It's only love she hoped to find

I heard your suitcase say goodbye
And as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love in suicide

You say you're cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

Now I'm praying to God
You'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I'd live and I'd die for you
Steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what a love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we're had some good times
How they have their own hiding place
I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drink, I'll be the wine

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I'd live and I'd die for you
Steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what a love can do
I'll be there for you

And I wasn't there when you were happy
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I'd live and I'd die for you

Where sometimes you talk so tough
Your feet don't touch the ground

They say oh yeah we were cruising to the back beat
Oh yeah, making love in the backseats
We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild in the streets

A member of the boy's brigade had a date with the girl next door
You know it made her daddy crazy
It only made her want him more
They weren't looking for trouble
That boy didn't want a fight, not tonight
So she headed out thru her bathroom window
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright
They said oh yeah we were cruising to the backbeat
Oh yeah, making love in the backseats

Bon Jovi,"Joey Keys was from my neighborhood
Some would say that he was bad and Joe thought that was good
Joey got the name ""Keys"" picking locks
He never really robbed no one; it sure amused the cops
Joey's parents owned a restaurant
After closing time they'd give us almost anything we'd want
I never cared that Joey Keys was slow

Though he couldn't read or write too well but we'd talk all night long.

Come on, come on, come on
What you gonna do with your life?
Come on, come on, come on
Chasing sparks in the nights
His old man said tomorrow is a ride that goes nowhere
But I'll pull some strings, get blackbird wings
And break us out of there

[Chorus:]
Hey Joey
C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams
Tell me all the sights you're gonna see
Tell me who you're gonna be

Hey Joey
You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight
Sometimes you got to stand and fight
It'll be alright
We're gonna find a better life

See Joe was 3 years younger to the day
Acting like a little brother but became my ball and chain
I met this girl named Rhonda, she fell for me
She said, ""I might learn to like him but love ain't built for three.""

[Chorus]

Hey Joey
You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight
Sometimes you got to stand and fight
It'll be alright

Hey Joey
News gets around in this fading neighborhood
The old man lost the restaurant
He drinks more than he should
It's time for Joey keys to do some good
Pick the lock off our lives, let's get out of here like we always said we would

[Chorus]

Hey Joey
You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight

Everybody holding on to something
Nobody wants to fade away

No forgiveness on the streets of this town
I left my patience at a traffic light
There's no denying that I almost lost it
Threw in the towel, too tired to fight

Tonight I need you
More than yesterday
Tonight I need you

Take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
Make me come alive
Hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
Rescue me tonight
Love me back to life

These days I'd trade sight for feeling
There are days my feeling's gone
Can't figure out whose life I'm living
I don't know right from wrong

When I lost my faith 
You found it and gave it back to me
There's a new light on your halo; it took blind eyes to see

That I need you
More than yesterday
Yeah, I need you

It's OK, take your time

Standing here my hands in my pockets
Like I have a thousand times
Thinking back it took one breath
One word to change my life

The first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello

When we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone
Everybody tries to kidnap your attention
You just smile and steal the show

You come to me and take my hand
We start dancin' slow
You put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low

From the first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello

And when you're laying down beside me
I feel your heartbeat to remind me

You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I wasn't there when you were happy
And I wasn't there when you were down
Didn't mean to miss your birthday baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you

Bon Jovi,"Should I? Could I?
Have said the wrong things right a thousand times
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine

You cried, I died
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one
I'm wasting time when I think about it

I should have drove all night, I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, Did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood

Could I? Should I?
Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night
Staying out too late with all my friends
You found me passed out in the yard again

You cried, I tried
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie
It's not so bad when you think about it

I should have drove all night, I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood
Intentions good

It's you and I, just think about it
I should have drove all night
I would have run all the lights

Bon Jovi,"Joey Keys was from my neighborhood
Some would say that he was bad and Joe thought that was good
Joey got the name ""Keys"" picking locks
He never really robbed no one; it sure amused the cops
Joey's parents owned a restaurant
After closing time they'd give us almost anything we'd want
I never cared that Joey Keys was slow

Though he couldn't read or write too well but we'd talk all night long.

Come on, come on, come on
What you gonna do with your life?
Come on, come on, come on
Chasing sparks in the nights
His old man said tomorrow is a ride that goes nowhere
But I'll pull some strings, get blackbird wings
And break us out of here

[Chorus]
Hey Joey
C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams
Tell me all the sights you're gonna see
Tell me who you're gonna be
Hey Joey
You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight
Sometimes you got to stand and fight
It'll be alright

We're gonna find a better life

See Joe was 3 years younger to the day
Acting like a little brother but became my ball and chain
I met this girl named Rhonda, she fell for me
She said, ""I might learn to like him but love ain't built for three.""

[Chorus]

Hey Joey
News gets around in this fading neighborhood
The old man lost the restaurant
He drinks more than he should
It's time for Joey keys to do some good
Pick the lock off our lives, let's get out of here like we always said we would

We're gonna find a better life

In the autumn air I smell your sweet perfume
I miss you sitting cross legged in this empty room
Yesterdays are eating me alive

I'm your angel, baby
I've got broken wings
I can't walk, I can't run, I can't drop
Until you're next to me, so the only thing

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train
Leave a flower the station
I know my destination
Love bring me home again

You try to reach me but I've sailed away
You tried to read me but my words got in the way
The music's over but the dance has just begun

I wish that I could just get back to Baltimore
You know I'd scratch, I'd claw, I'd scream
Till I'm raw, just to fall down at your door

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train
Leave a flower at the station
I know my destination
Love bring me home again

Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks
At the broken hearts that don't come back
'Cause the train has left the station with my pain
Let them forget my name, oh

I'm on a last chance train

Sitting here I smoke my nineteenth cigarette
Now all that's left are ashes, butts and my regrets
It's your taste that I just can't forget

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train

Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks
At the broken hearts that don't come back
We'll be laughing at them, crying in the rain

About a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave
They say he went in his sleep with a smile on his face
Bet he was dreaming 'bout better days

When the crash of the drums hit like waves on a beach
That cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams
We were searching for a savior like anybody else
Trying to save ourselves from ourselves

Just a garage band, we weren't alive
We were livin' in Garageland

Our parents all held jobs but we had other plans
We acted like our heroes they just didn't understand
And we were never afraid to fall
It was us and those four walls

Just a garage band, we weren't alive
We were livin' in Garageland
Nothing ever felt so right
Just us, those guitars and a Saturday night

'Cause with a strap on your back, you have wings on your feet
You felt like a king when you walked down the street
We heard those old records and knew we belonged
When the drums hit the groove, we'd all sing along

She cleans houses and she takes in wash at night

Because she's rich with the things money can't buy

She don't need clothes, she don't want diamonds
Don't need a brand new car to drive in
What she's got is love and that's a lot
At least it's a good start

I saw your car parked outside Motel Cascade 
Saw two shadows go to town on the shade 
I can't believe my own lyin' eyes, oh my 
It better be your girlfriend I saw going down some other guy 

You told me you loved me, ‘til death do us part 
So tell me there's a tombstone where there used to be a heart

You said you couldn't live without me 
So why aren't you dead? 
Instead of six feet under you're in someone else's bed 
There's just one thing that I can't get through my head 
You said you couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead? 

I cut your face out of our old photographs 
And all the junk you left behind's in the trash 
Well, I hoped you were a goner for sure 
Well, there's been a resurrection, yeah, a miracle cure 

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
If you can't trust the livin' baby who can you trust?

You said you couldn't live with out me, what a surprise! 
Instead of laying you out I'm laying down on the line 
You spend my hard-earned money, you left me in the red 
You said you couldn't live without me…. so why aren't you dead?

Bon Jovi,"You're boy sits down to write a song
'Cause he thinks he's got something to say
Innocence thinks it can change the world
But the world keeps getting in the way

It's a small list for the optimist who believes that he can fly
In a long line full of pessimists to stop him every time he tries
Some people see things as they are and ask, why
I dream things that never were, I take my shot and say, ""Why not?""

Hey, hey, hey, this one's for the dreamers
Hey, hey, hey, doubting disbelievers, get out of my way
I bend but I ain't breaking, scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

Convicted by convictions, they were carving out your cross
They came to take your measurements just to show you who's the boss
Until I reach that promised land I won't stop
When I get there I'll shake your hand so meet me on that mountain top

Hey, hey, hey, this one's for the dreamers
Hey, hey, hey, doubting disbelievers, get out of my way
I bend but I ain't breaking, scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

(Hey, hey, hey)
This one's for the breathing
Hey, hey, hey forgotten and the bleeding
I may whisper but I'm screaming, I got angels, I got demons
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

I'm not suggesting that you fly with me
Well here's a dose of some reality, you're swinging at a change-up
Boy you better shape up, here comes the wrecking ball
Good morning, here's your wake-up call

(Hey, hey, hey)
I feel the change a comin'
Hey, hey, hey see that train a comin'
(Hey, hey, hey)

Hey, hey, hey the dying and the bleeding, get out of my way

To blind the angels

The fruit of your vine
It tastes so bitter sweet

Come on and send the sign
I'll be your dirty little secret
And you'll be mine

You got me knock, knock knocking at your door
And I'll be coming back for more
We made a promise and we keep it
Our dirty little secret

We act like strangers
When you're holding his hand
'Cause there's a danger
That we both understand

We run like thiefs
Through the temple of sin
Till we fall on our knees then you go back to him
I want to feel alive

Solo 

So I save a prayer 
When I need it most 
To the Father, Son 
And the Holy Ghost 
And I'll sign it from a sinner 
With no name 

When I meet my maker 
Will he close the book 
On the hearts I broke 
And the lives I took 
Will he walk away 
'Cause my soul's 
It's too late to save 

Now I ain't getting into heaven 
If the devil has his way 
I swear I'm gonna live forever

Bon Jovi,"So now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way.

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step alone the by way
And more much more than this
I did it my way.

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I face it all and I stood tall
And did it my way.

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of loosing
And the now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and my I say
Not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way.

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way.",My Way,2007

Wanted dead or alive

What was going on below

And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, now maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

I don't know, I don't know",Whole Lot of Leavin' [DVD],2007
Bon Jovi,"It might be hard to be lovers
But it's harder to be friends
Baby pull down the covers
It's time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
I'll just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby
Till we ain't strangers anymore

Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Don't you think its time we say
Some things we haven't said
It ain't too late to get back to that place
Back to where, we thought it was before
Why don't you look at me
Till we ain't strangers anymore

Sometimes it's hard to love me
Sometimes it's hard to love you too
I know it's hard believing
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life
With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby
Till we ain't strangers anymore

It's hard to find forgiveness
When we just turn off the lights
It's hard to say you're sorry
When you cant tell wrong from right
It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score

So lets get down to it baby
There ain't no need to lie

Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes

Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
Till we ain't strangers anymore

We're not strangers anymore
We're not strangers
We're not strangers anymore",Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore [*],2008
Bon Jovi,"Angels falling from the sky
Imagine that imagine that
Nobody's getting out of here alive
No turning back no turning back
Who's going to bail out all our shattered dreams?
And scrape some truth off of these city streets
No time for praying get up off your knees

[Chorus]
There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
'Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in, breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokenpromiseland

Let's close our eyes and just disappear
Slip through the cracks no looking back
We'll get a million miles away from here
And let the past just fade to black

No need to fear what hasn't happened yet
Life will get you but you can't forget

Shots ring out without a warning
No one seems to even blink in this town
Two dead and a baby missing
Sirens screaming in the distance

A night cut down in tragedy
His defense another generation breakdown

Yeah, yeah

What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listening
Or have you just given up

Corporate countries go to war
Behind the lies they're fighting for
And black gold from an old king's soul won this round
How can someone take a life
In the name of God and say it's right
How does money lead to greed
When there's still hungry mouths to feed

Yeah, yeah

In these hands I've held the gun
But it's too late for dying

The whole world in my hands
Trying to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man
He would always say I'm sorry
Every time he had to leave
And I was much too young to understand
When he would say to me

When you're young, you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There will come a day when you have to say hello to goodbye
Sit down son come take my hand
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You'll live before you die

I was barely seventeen, summer of seventy-nine
Already I was feeling like I was running out of time
I had this girl, we fell in love
Or should I say that she had me
That fateful night changed our lives
And made a memory

When you're young, you always think
The sun is gonna to shine
There will come a day when you have to say hello to goodbye
She laid me down, she took my hand
Looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me she said
You gotta live before you die
Live before you die

You learn to love, to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
You live before you die

I've made mistakes, I've caught some breaks
But I got no regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget

When you're young, you always think
The sun is gonna shine

And these were our words
They keep me strong, baby

I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms

I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms, baby

Like the singles need to change
Like the poets need the pain
I need you in these arms tonight

So tired of living life in black & white
Right now she’s missing those technicolor kisses
When it just ain’t alive

In the middle staring down this town
There’s only one thing in this world that she knows
He said forever and he’ll never let her down

Naked on her floor
Windows up, the curtains blowing
She don't lock the door

And you're my masterpiece
I painted you a lifetime
Now what's left are memories, oh

Sunlight's in the curtains
Diamonds in the trees
I gave you colors blue and gold
As you lay upon the sheets
Something so familiar drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures of you

I could almost smell your perfume
In each brush stroke of the flowers
I left you tea from China
Waiting in your sacred tower

Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do

I'd still fill the canvas from the pictures in my mind

Bon Jovi,"Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
I think she is still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

When you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

Do not be conformed unto what the world do
Be washed by the word and renew the mind
Take the mud from your eyes and quit walking with the blind

A lot of busters play tricks and try to fade this
But they know they can't deny the like the way it ride
I reside on the left hand of the map
Pray to God every day for protection where I'm at
From the land of funkadelic inspired beats
Mobbin' from church in impalas to swap meets
Trying to take this rap game to another level
On point like the crease on my khakis gaffel the devil
Bow down to the one who's always able to hear us
Never wrong will he steer us keep the evil far from near us

Curious of multiplicity in this thang called the rap game
Everybody claiming be different but sounding the same
Don't fold, Don't let the music take control
Of your soul to get the bank roll
At times thinking of varied and different kinds
Of people poppin' in tapes hearin' sound-a-like rhymes
My mind is turnin' trying to figure out why
That everytime we shoe 'em Christ people try to turn back
Still though kickin' it to you like toe to heel bro
If you didn't know the Mid-West kicks the quick flow
See, it just dazzles me
Original individuals is what we strive to be

Tighten my style and maintain it like gals do braids
Take my time to elevate like wrecking balls on cranes
Hoping you get convicted if you feel you done wrong
Like people doused in denim livin' within' prison walls
Comin' out the area where the twang bang
Like a mix 'tween Shania Twain and a chain gang
When you roam pay attention to they song before you clone it
Like disciples on a boat finding fish we boat it, boat it

Who said the girls can't rhyme? Well that's a fable
A female that's a Factor is just as quick to grab the cable
Unless, if best, we rock a show with wireless
Verbalize in the chrome dome into the abyss
Servin' hard not for the money yet divinely employed
Writin' checks by the word that never comes back void
I've ensued to be renewed and navigate through difficulty
Watch him work his wonders in his time he catapults me
From start to finish from the hip I hop in it
Like a pair of new shoes I can't wait another minute

Lyrics - Integrity (With Grits)

Talking:
Yo, yo what's up yo?
Yo, what's up man?
Yo, y'all are GRITS right?-yeah man
Yo, I-I want to get into this gospel rap thing man.
Aw, sh man it's a task
Yo I was just wonderin' if I could give you this rhyme I wrote
Go ahead man, I ain't hatin'. Go ahead yo


It's all about me, me, and did I mention me
I'm the dopest rapper in the gospel rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper
Yo, all y'all cats need to retire
With your played out raps, I'm the roughest and toughest
I love the spotlight yo you better make sure this mike sounds right
Or I'll charge you double on this honorarium
Don't ask me to speak words of encouragement cause yo I got the dopest skills
Don't ask me to do what God wills,
It's all about keepin' it real and makin' sure I get me a fat type of record deal
Give the crowd something they can feel
Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile
Yo, I been doin' this a long while, man, like two months even
So what if I look like a heathen, I can still kill the ruckus demon
I got all the girls fiendin' , I put emcee back into emceeing
Yo God and hip-hop versus the god of hip-hop I believe in
I'm acheivin' what I want. These skills is what I flaunt
Yo you caint get me so tell me what you got.
Man, I live and die for the god of hip-hop, I mean God and hip-hop
So y'all fools need to stop

CHORUS
This is a message to you rap infants,
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills but skill alone don't get you props
It takes integrity, when rappin' for Christ on microphones

Who's this Babylon emcee with the audacity, approaching me
As if I got a stamp of approval for his fallacy
I hear you talkin' 'bout yourself
And claim you keep it real but I ain't feelin' it
I'm feelin' to your flesh but only kill the little light so dimly shinin'
I question why you rhymin',
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use Him as a jewel well then your crown
And you clout your time will tell
In life He must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
You see the ministry begins theminute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life you hear in the pages of His very Word
Cause if not face His rage.
You ain't understandin' He demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to hip-hop caint be found in His Commandments
Take notice because the atmosphere is about to get tense
Wanna find relatin' truth to some gone take it offense
Young cats, heed the message of this elder emcee
Who got responsibility to let you know what kind of bilities to key
But it seems that some of y'all ain't caught the vision as we

And a long tail like the one that sheila got, would she like to share a meal or not?

I don’t know how I got here
There’s a knocking on the door
One, Two, Three, Four

It’s quite a bloody mess in here and no one feels responsible
The fragmentation of our selves, nah, don’t be so sensible
You know they build on sand but they call it an empire

Those friends in higher places are deceptive clowns parading
The cocaine cowboys and the wall street vampires

Testing distant waters, quietly behind the scenes
My arm is growing tired, of waving the white flag
And now there’s nothing left to light, just filters of old fags
The prime minister’s driving in a long black limousine

Tweet tweet, tweet tweet, yeah
And the birds go, tweet tweet, tweet tweet

You be dancing, leave me asking you for more

That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart

There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, let the music take me home
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die

Don't tell me I don't know you
I don't know you
Remember what I told you
Through these black eyes

There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
'Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, let the music take me home
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die",All I See,2014

Mission impossible, cause these hoes simply incapable
Goin' for the cash, and dash first chance available

Undercover setup bitch behind a job

Now, I gotta wet up this bitch
Hope in the meantime, this ho get hit
Damn, ain't no reason for the games that you play

But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles

No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off

When them white oak acorns started to drop

I twisted my ankle walking to the stand
Everywhere you look was a sweet persimmon
Big around as a Florida lemon
Was a white tailed grocery store all over the land
But this spring during turkey season
Jack frost came and he went to freezing
Everything with a bumblebee a bud and a bloom
Then summer came and there weren't no rain

DNR predicted deer season was doomed
Well me and my buddies we got to thinking
Sitting around one night drinking
How we gunna fill up our deer tags
Then a light went off and I started to grin
I remembered about my big grain bin
We started fillin' up 50 pound bags
Of them yellow acorns
They were fare weight in gold

I'm gonna have more meat than my deep freeze can hold
With all them yellow acorns
You have 'em eating from your hand

Yea we filled us up a dump truck load
And the farm looked like the yellow brick road
Ain't this much corn in Nebraska, Illinois
Then a monster buck came sniffing round
I was bout to lay to old hammer down
When I heard a voice say
Get down from there boy

Well I showed the warden my wanted sign
That I posted up on my property line
It said this here corn is to feed the birds and squirrels aright
Well let me just make one thing clear
Any deer caught feeding here is trespassing
And will be shot on sight

And then he slipped them cuffs around my arms
Took all I had cept the farm
He took my truck my gun
Took my cold beer

Is on TV and in a magazine
And I learned my lesson
Now I'm staring clear

Some say, they love you don't mean a damn thing

As if I was a band, you the people in the stands understand

I keep my lyrics slum and rigid
Young prospects watch, my feet don't miss my pivot
Don't matter my year, my gives stay consistent
I went from born to blazed, to beautiful days and beautiful ways

Laying down the truth for a bank head, respect it
I try to interject it, I say through the music and the medic
I'm dedicated to my pen and my pistol
My family and my hood I wish you nothing but good

Show us in the good book, if we go off to heaven, reverend
We swerving in our innocence

Jammed her up wit coke, strung out on soaps

Don't believe me, ask them Adamsvillers, this A-T-L nigga

Bitch, nigga, what the fuck's up
(Anybody can get it)
Hoe, niggaz, go pull your skirts up
Don't think that you won't get touched, bitch

I'm in your grill now, nigga what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now, bitch what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now, nigga what you gon' do?
Don't think that you won't get touched, bitch

I sit at the bar and tear up hundred dollar bills
My car, my Hummer got 26 inch rims
I'm a star on my side of the earth, I bleed the block
Promethazine, codeine, water and hubba rock

Million dollar dreams and fiends and things of that nature
Triple beams and things and T-Mobile paint ya
Told myself, I need to stop pushin' hop
I need to stop pushin' hop so I can buy a WingStop

My young hyenas be bustin' guns, mashin' and pistol packin'
Smokin' so much 'dro that our lungs feel like they collapsin'
Trick I see you and yo' partners laughin'
Jaw-jackin' and scammin' and plottin'

Old soft-ass, medicated, cotton-ass nigga
You're out of line I told you once befo' it's dubya dot
Bust a head dot com, on mine, hit the flo'
And don't come back no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Motherfucker it's E-4-oh from the Valle-Jo
Still rappin' like I'm po', beotch

Bitch, nigga, what the fuck's up
(Anybody can get it)
Hoe, niggaz, go pull your skirts up
Don't think that you won't get touched, bitch

I'm in your grill now, nigga what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now, bitch what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now, nigga what you gon' do?
Don't think that you won't get touched, bitch

I'ma kill a motherfucker's ass if I have to
But is it worth it is the question that I ask you
To blast your punk-ass
And is you bleedin', only to give Satan a damn good

Reason to play with me, look bitch I'm sayin'
You don't listen 'less that tec-9 sprayin' yo' ass
Glass breakin' in your home boy, thinkin' you fast
I never mash out, 'til the iron smack up yo' body
Then you pass out, I pray to God for peace

I done best to get my black ass out of these streets
But y'all don't listen 'less I'm cussin' and bustin' the shit
You keep beggin' and I'ma give it to ya you bitch
In your face, your back, your chest, neck and lungs

You want war, you will get it for Mr. Crawfordson
They call me really really doe, ain't no hoe in my blood
A couple slugs bitch you thugs'll give me a hug
Real gangster niggaz raise up, y'all sticky ooh-wee niggaz blaze up
Or get yo' ass sprayed up, bitch nigga

And there you have it
(And there you have it)
Anybody can get it
(Anybody)

Don't act like you can't get touched, peeyimp
Yeah, my dude Bone Crusher

In that black on black on black in the 'lac 'cause I'm so wild

I get, drunk off that, I'll be high off this
I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss
They put me hot on list, where players are posted
But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted

And the prayer get toasted, 'cause I keep the flame on
The face for the game on - leave a stain on anything I puts my name on
Disrespect and the tech'll peck a player like woody

The debate is now, who's the greatest emcee?

So get them thangs out you betta lock up ya house
And tell the cops they let the animals out
Break bread nigga

[Verse 1]
I-20 Meet the Dealer 'cause I'm out on bail
I broke free and I ain't never goin back to jail
ATL's eastside says I'm back from hell
Reintroduced to my connect and I got sacks to sell
Since I was young I broke bones usin sticks and stones
Puttin bruises on you losers lames leave me alone
I'll be servin it for certain til the day that I die
You got that reggie for the low I got that fire for the high
Niggaz travelin when they rappin but I feel like they actin
And I ain't talkin bout vacation if I say that I'm packin
Hear that hunger in my voice and all the pain in my eyes
If this the only chance I get to you can bet I'mma ride
I got my back against the wall but my hand on my tool
'cause niggaz gotta give me somethin I got nothin to lose
A-Town's new ruler throw ya side in the sky
why'all niggaz lovin how ya livin but I'm (distorted) ready to die

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You niggaz settin up to get me better come wit that four
This 20 got magazines and I ain't talkin +The Source+
Mr. Pain'll change the game by the time I'mma reign
I catch a charge like a flagrant foul deep in the lane
why'all niggaz know where why'all can find me see I'm deep in the south
Where niggaz put away they Benz and pull they Chevrolet out
why'all niggaz cakin on these broads spend a stack on that bitch
I'll throw that ho right out the VIP and throw some yak ('gnac) on that bitch
And as far as all this beefin why'all ain't worryin me
We the index so I'm body that's a story in me
If I say it then I meant it you can take it at that
why'all been eatin off these streets and now I'm takin it back
why'all won't see me sideways you get it live and direct

And if I'm fuckin witcha club I'm buyin (distorted) more than the bar

I-20 is the shorts I be still takin aim
I'm the blocks head coach bitch I'm teachin the game
So I'm servin like I'm Agassi Venus or Serena
I'm ridin wit a felony you duckin misdemeanors
And man I'm still hurtin and my mama's still workin
So I stay wit the glove and a mask like a servant

I can't handle all these bills and payments
This stuff is overstressing me (but I still gotta do it)
Baby mama put me on them papers and get nothing for the baby (but I still gotta do it)
I can't keep on working, (keep on working)
Seems like the whole world's ignoring me (but I still gotta do it)
Schemers keep on drinking (keep on drinking)
Everybody's getting more than me (but I still gotta do it)

So what you think, what you know?
Yes all right and I paid the price, but still I'm
Going through a lot, sitting on the block now
Through a lot, slanging out my drop now
Through a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going through a lot, I'm hitting on the cops now

I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block,
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't goin' never stop,
I see them laughing at me fo cause my pants red,
And my do' won't shut and my car's shabby,
But I see the future man like I'm Nostradamus,
And in my heart all I see is a future star,
But in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man,
But y'all don't feel my stress y'all don't understand,
The next step is my pistol and it goes down,
Wiggle it out fat boy just calm down,
And sing this song, and sing that song,
Cause god goin' make a way for me to get my hustle on.

Put her in your life, I swear that you'll never forget her
Swear that you'll never regret her, but she's cold so bring you a sweater

You can you meet me meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky!
You could meet me in the sky, (You can meet me in the sky!) the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky.
'Cause we can fly above all the haters!

They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high! 
They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!
They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!
They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!

I done made it up the mountain, lookin' down on the valley, and I'm feelin' I can fly, so I dive off the cliff.
Hear the little kids scream; they don't know I got wings.
'Til I sprinkle them with the dreams, and I hit 'em with the gift.
Say 'Bye bye' to them haters, haters.
No more lies .. they can't fade us, fade us!
Why they wanna test? Now you rockin' with the best and my whole fan fam' is the greatest, greatest.
Moves countin' like a calculator, evaluate the master playas. Operation: 'Stack Your Paper.'
Captivatin' money makers feel the love from above, he's an eagle, he's a dove, call him Bone's emancipator!
Everybody's a congratulator. Come and ride on this elevator, better yet take this escalator.
Graduate to the new skyscrapers!

When we put 'em on a level that's if you can deal with! We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness!
Surely livin' in the life, it's for the thrills. We went up and over the hill, went through the whole drill!
Haters try to kill with kindness, when there's nothin' they can do to to the finest.
Though they won't dare cross over the line, for tryin', y'all know what's gonna happen, so they might as well remain behind us.
Way behind! We go to hardcore grind, and never take an issue for granted since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness.
Better take it in stride!
They don't wanna see us alive, but you always steady creepin', reapin', weepin', niggas went and got in way too deep in (deep in).
You gotta practice that before you start preachin'. (preachin')
But ain't no way that they can keep up (keep up)
'Cause we keepin' the heat on. It really don't matter where we can meet up!

Nigga had it bad, cause I never had (...), thought the rainy days was over!
Livin' in the past, livin' ghetto fab', never lookin' back!
But the fact is that I never went nowhere!
The truth is, me and my own ghetto got a love affair. (got a love affair)
It's so real, things we did, my conscious outta here.
I don't care, I deserve everything I earn.
Hell yeah I deserve some pain! I know I hurt!
Stop talkin'! Night-walkin' real night stalkers, zoners, hungry, heard it here first!
If you don't believe me, with wings I'll lead you!

Playa hater hate! They can hear me but they better stay away or see Krayzie look insane!
So if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom, way up underneath my feet.
'Cause really I've been turnin' them leaves to never ever let the suckas rise, or let them bustas kill the high.
'Cause they jealous in the mind, they remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me pullin me down.
Passed on for the flight, keepin' me on the ground.
Still I rise and when I takeoff they fall. (they fall, they fall)
Raise to the ceiling, try and stay away from the pretender.

And when I met Him in the sky, He had a body like a man and the lower body tellin'
The Lord that he had a plan to make Him sure I wasn't evil.
But I'm comin' with my people. Ain't no sequel, ain't no women, ain't no vessals.
I'ma settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage. I will live forever with a serpent on my head.
Little glory, that's my man! I'll be damned! If I comin' through, I'm runnin' with my pistol.
Weren't for Moses, I'ma die but I'ma come back with y'all (with y'all, with y'all)
That's the way to get y'all. Picture sinister plots! I'm not 'nigga with no land.'
I imagine a strand of lightning bolts and tightened ropes.
I'm fightin' folk with no hope. Earth got me loc'ed!
Now chillin' in the smoke house! No doubt! No clout!
Now we're goin' all out! Earth-ball that's all! Never let the devil call.
Revelations! Little Bizzy nigga so long! Go long! Metal was so precious.

I'm happy to know , the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me
You rippin' the bone like me, can get it as long as me

I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and every day I wake
Niggas rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in my drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'

And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority

For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and a pager
Searchin my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every thug nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished
They will bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if their're fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam you down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
But Krayzie Bone will swarm

A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Bone was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
The police, I'm sayin': ""Fuck you punk!""
Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
And I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
And any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a helluva scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The muthafuckin' killer that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound
Boom boom, yeah, somethin like that

Sweatin' my thug while I be thuggin' in the shack and
Shinin' them lights in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much, but
I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an A.K.
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity along with my group cause it's violence
It's the Bone with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a thugster nigga
But still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A nigga in a uniform waitin' to get shot by me
Or one of my niggas

(Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool)
And as you all know Layzie Bone came to rule

And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb muthafucka with a gun
And when I'm rollin' off the 8, you'll be the one

Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin' a bank to get rich
Ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen, and I'm low on ends, fuck calm, I tried to stay thug
Got flowin' skills, but niggas, they bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the forty-four mag plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag, can't reveal when I glide with the moneybag
ride to the hide, count my flags. I be livin' on the darkside
And I can't escape, some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is if I play with my gauge
It's a raid. Put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets, watches, jewels, and you'll be safe
I snatched the clerk up by her neck, put the gun in her mouth and said
""Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
if you want to be killed try some stupid shit
And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell"" 
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
Locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail
Well, tickets I'm out the door
hopped in the smug, and I break fast
Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, loc'd out as I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good, and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight. Covered my tracks
Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine, and if you stall, then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid. I'll rob ya
See, a nigga creep on a come up

See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down
steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid
Gotta gauge at my waist that be spellin' out murder
That'll get a nigga locked the cage
Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause
What can I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullshit
But a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store
Select which one will I raid. Got be headin' downtown
'cause tonight's the night
Dressed in my black, wearin' makeup on my face 
so a nigga can't be seen in the spotlight
Stole two cars, and I parked one north
Parked one east for the smooth switch
When a nigga bail, how the fuck he gonna tell if a 
nigga don't dwell in the same shit? 
Climb to the roof, and I'm peepin' out the scene
And there's no one I can spot, so I get my ass down
Looked around through the window, and I broke the bitch out with a rocl
Now I jump my ass in. Start to fillin' up the bag
And a nigga comin' up on these diamonds
Grabbed a couple herring bones, and some rings
And some (brooches), still thinkin' how them diamonds was shining
Went to the cash register, broke the bitch open
Grabbed all the money they had
And a nigga gettin' goin' gone to Bone, yeah
Got to let my niggas check out my bag
And I got away smooth, 'cause I had the shit planned
And ain't no bullshit get brung up

Creepin' in my smug, so reapin', peek into the window, let me cock this

Up outta the door, with a pump to her temple, shoulda seen her tremble
Push any alarms, and I drop them bombs on moms
It's just that simple. I took my ganjas and fried 'em
Don't gimme no hassle, bitch, 'cause I've been scopin' for weeks

Buckshots up into them dreads, and I love when I hear them pump red
One that callin' me bluff, I stuffed him with the quickness
He made out with a smooth thirty G's

So with a me slug, mo thug jumped into him smug, rolled the blunt up

Runnin' side by side with number one
Murder mo drop my gauge on 'em
When the po-po chase,
If they catch me barehanded I'm done
Rip's gripping the six shot pump, so spill it
Copper lettin' the lead off
Copper thought that he had me caught
Little Layzie blew his head off 
Get him up, and get up,
The bullets they start to get lit up,
Number one best start duckin' with ah gun already buckin'
Bust me lead on the double glock 'n
Where the fiends roll up for rocks 'n,
This perfect getaway,
From the pigs when I peel and I hit the fences,
Rippin' up the trench and,
I'm bailing while they trailing
Better in hell than in the cell
And it ain't no telling where the coppers be dwelling,
One had spotted me, pick up ah piece and shot a me
But I practice what I preach
And see that these slugs up in his body got him,
Run, wid smoke coming from the barrel ah me gun
Hit the bend, oh what the dumb dumb I got yum yummed on the dead end
They set in, then they lead in,
They wanting me off in the coffin
Cops from everywhere was yellin and wailin' I went unconscious,
From the stompin' taking ah loss, and waking up in the coffin,
And without no stallin'
Cell I was tossed in to be arraigned at dawning,
Looking in the eyes of a judge,
He knew right where to put that thug
Made to be so, with no parole
In the hole but I won't budge
Sent me to deathrow,
Watchin' the time by fly past
But Rip'll be sittin' mindless never spineless, in silence
Hoping I die fast, but chill,
Never do, sleepa, gotta get put that on all me reefer
Somehow must beat ya, so peep out the creep or the reaper will meet ya

Gotta pump them slugs up in them cops
Steady made 'em drop glock went pop pop
Goin' out like a thug on the double glock,
Back from hell and ready to bail,
Time to hit they trail cause they wanted my nigga fried
Holdin' the Bible when I got a grenade I'ma go inside the squad,
Gettin' ready for the rumble
When I heard them mumbles, pullin' me gauge in laughter
Keep buckin 'em faster all I was thinkin'
When I see them busters scatter
Betta watch out for them buckshot's
Cause them can't fade me gauge,
Gotta bust them souls in the grave,
So I'm buckin' them straight to the pave, can't be saved,
I'm bucking, little Ripster reinforcements comin' in faster
Blast give my nigga double Zs the Mack-10
Lettin' the gun gun blaze on they ass,
Gotta rip in them chests through vests
Mack-10s, sawed off eruptions, got plenty ammunition
No missing listen destruction I'm bustin'
Cause I'm making that getaway, bound to getaway,
Niggas got to escape and it's never to late
When you dash and tryna' break
Nigga just can't test the Bone fate

Comin' up to the front door barri-caded,
And I pulled ah grenade, tossed to the door, let it explode
And we made it, creepin' in the courtyard

Hittin' the fence and jump in it quick

Quick bust in first when he hit that fence niggas got cut the fuck up,
We steady bucking, steady duckin' buckin' while I was jumpin'
All we was thinking is don't get caught
Nigga like me get the gun running
Gunning fronting with thugs gotta get to the smug
Turn around and we pump slugs, put 'em in the mud,
And all across my face was the red that lay in blood,
Dodging the who, make the gun flip with ah swoo,
Bailing back on with my troops,
I'm runnin' with 4 crazy niggas
That's down with they niggas they ain't scared to shoot,
Now I'm rolling, no more than ah half ah mile we get stopped
Cops surround Bone, we load glocks
And squeeze say fuck all these road blocks
Busted ah you, then put that bitch in reverse
And I get the swish and I push the button
That boy came out the trunk and,
Put it in drive see that Souljah boy bucking,
Back in the other direction,
Po-po came quick then heat up,
Niggas blast at each other,
Open up they doors and they get they feet up,
I jumped outta the car, had to jump over the hood,
Cause I'm headin' straight for the woods
So the niggas they follow behind me
We getaway smooth, ah nigga made good
Came up quick to the hideout
Wait until midnight till we ride out,
Hit ah car so we can drive out,
While we waited we all got fried out, fool
If you'se a thuggish ruggish thug nigga scream mo,
Took one ah my niggas off deathrow now we got one mo to go

Bust one, they done.
Cleveland is where we from.
Hearts-thugs have none.

High techs and khakis when jackin', sawed-off, 
There's really no place to run.
Niggas get vicious with my click, 
'cause even the bitches carry guns.

[Bizzy Bone]
Soon as I hit the scene, ?
Feelin' for a pistol,
But I didn't have no gun.
Come with original thugsta shit.
I be flippin' it with me tongue.
Nigga, Cleveland is the city where we come from,
And I show them hoes up outta the Clair that thugs don't run from none.
Follow rip one, now, on and on,
Them definitely got me back.
And I'm throwin' up St. Clair thugsta niggas,
With or without my gat.
Forever be ready to pull out me murder tools East 99 style, fools.
Me put it in mind on murderin' you,
Followin' whenever me murderous trues.
Niggas that claim to bang bang,
When it comes to slang things, they do.
They know they cannot buck me,
One of 'em sure to slug me,
But they hope the thug I be, Bizzy.
Better let 'em him be or they'll see.
Nigga, hangin', swangin', never to miss. The Biz is me.

[Chorus: x2]

[Layzie]
Livin' in the Land of the Heartless,
With a sawed-off pump, shootin' craps.
Hand on my strap, roll thick, 'cause they jack.
Runnin' up on the Bone, you needin' to be pap pap. 
Soldier thugs be pumpin' them slugs,
Defendin' they drugs.
When they roll up,
Niggas be creepin' up slow,
Heavy packed with they gats,
And try to pull a hold up,
But nigga, now hold on.
Want to test the Bone?
The gauge is shown.
Any is mind blown,
Lookin' down the barrel of this mausberg chrome to the dome.
Bone, clack back me gauge in a rage,
Copper take these here rocks.
Double glock,
My pistols be pumpin' and buckin' out shots whenever
The trouble knocks.
Steadily hittin', me clean up,
Get lit up for ready your soul to burn,
And I blow your shit up, get 'em on the get up,
Cause niggas must learn.
Yearnin' to earn cheese.
Ready to die, so niggas can't take these.
Wantin' to clock G's, want to move keys,
Not takin' a loss on my green leaves, please.
East nine nine, crime finds mine,
Strayin' on this road to hell,
And prison walls, testin' balls,
For the cause, gotta get that sale,
And bailin', kickin' up mud, rollin',
I get with my thugs.
Rippin' apart shit, so nigga, don't start shit,
Cause we kill in the Land of the Heartless, Die.

And Leather face is not a punk bitch so a nigga just can't fuck me,
Nigga better have me cash,
Or I kill his whole family when the twelve gauge pump blast,
Now test me,
Never ever let a nigga ride when he think he fin to slide,
Pop him in the spine, get him for the money,
Nigga tried to play me and dash,
And that's why me thugs should put slugs in that ass, then tell he
And me never want to see no,
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga ends low,
If he scared to smoke a primo,
Gotta go with the fiends and in the click is a no no.

Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,"Everyday it was almost the same thang
'Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

What you are about to hear will portray
The image of a young black male living everyday life
In the ghetto today
So Bone, drop dat

(You know what?) Live like a hustla
'Cause I ain't with bein' broke
I'm rollin' dope, and I'm bound to let the gun smoke
I'm gettin' richer everyday because
I'm selling crack, and, yo, police ain't jack
So I just wait to pull the trigger back
I sell a twenty, a ten, and I won't let you slide
I need all ten, and I ain't takin' nine ninety-nine
So how you figure you're gettin' up around the Bone?
You try to gank, you catch some blows to your damn dome
Don't take no shorts, that's why I'm climbin' to the top
And everyday I sell a thousand dollars worth of rocks
Yo, ain't it funny the way the Bone will make his money
And won't get caught because the cops
To me ain't nothin' but dummies?
So what you need? I'm servin'
Everything is straight. I mean it's great
And now I'm rollin' heavyweight
And coppers hate to see me come up off the 'cane
And makin' ends to Biz is like (just) an everyday thang

Everyday it was almost the same thang
'Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

I hit the floor
And now I'm lookin' for my khaki pants
I looked around and couldn't find 'em
So I put on Stan's
And then I headed to the closet for my Fila shoes
They lookin' hit 'cause I was runnin'
From the biggy-blues (siren)
That's when I headed out the hizzy
And jumped in the smug
And put my skully on my head
And now I'm lookin thug
Car souped up
Posse seven deep
Now we gettin loose
Well since we posse'd up
We might as well go get the brews
I bust a you-turn on the Clair
So we can rush the store
We need a case, or maybe two
Or maybe three or four
Pay for the brews, up in the smug
And now we getting
I be like, ""Word up 'cause,""
Brushin' on my peach fuzz
Looked for the party
Cause there's lots of women to be grabbin'
We went on ? to the one Ali was havin'
We stepped up in it, pumped as hell
And yo it wasn't lame
And gettin' brewed to Layzie Bone
Is just an everyday thang 

Everyday it was almost the same thang
'Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

Load up the pistol, ask Layzie for a couple clips
And get the twelve-gauge, cause I got another lick
Round up the posse, call up James, Wish
And double-Zs, my nigga Tone, ?
You know we scorin' keys
I heard the dread's sellin' some dope
It's comin off the lake, down at the dock
And yo, it 'posed to be at eight
So hurry up, we getting paid, no matter what the cost
And since they thinkin' they all that
They gotta take a loss
They can't hang with the Bones
Get it in your head, forget a dread
I'm leavin' all those suckas dead
We on the scene, I must admit, Hoop Phi's drunk
They started slamin' those dreads like a power dunk
I mean, blastin' and crashin', K-Bone is the assassin
I started sprayin', and count out caskets
We got the dope, and we got rich
But yo, we still the same, and it'll never change
'Cause it's an everyday thang

Everyday it was almost the same thang
'Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

Call up your posse, chump, and yo
And you will never win it
Because my organization, see
We got fifty million niggas in it
You wanna scrap? Come on, let's do it
We can get it done
It's kinda funny plus I'll show you that
I'm not the one (I ain't the one)
You stupid bro, now what you ball up your fist for?
Make you think we was buckin'
And capped you down with my pistol
A dirty move, yo, Layzie had the sucka fooled
Yeah, it was cool. They shoulda had the boy schooled
You messin'with a brotha, Bone. Yes it's good to go
I beat on niggas everyday, so, yo, I'm not a ho
So gimme P's if you see me walkin' down the street
Because I can't be beat, known for breakin' niggas teeth
I'm droppin be's, and you never catch me chill and calm
I hang with Vicki when I wanna drop the damn bomb
See all my fellas, and even the Bone
We is insane, and throwin' blows on foes
Is just an everyday thang 

Yeah, Layzie Bone up in the house
You know what I'm sayin?
I gotta give some P's up to my homies
That's still doin them everyday thangs with me
I gotta say what's up to my brother Stan Howse
Vicki da Bomb, Wish Bone, Bizzy Bone
And Krayzie Bone, my boy Tony Tone, Old Mo
And the troublemakers in the house

To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and a pager

Thinkin' every thug nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished
They will bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if their're fags or what

Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast

Maybe it's because I kick so much, but
I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger

Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,"Verse 1:  Bizzy Bone
I'm sending a message to warn you imposters
All hating in my business
When I see you I'm a drop you
Get slugged and get drugged
My niggas I'll hustle to pay the judge
Got you when I spot you I should pop you
Even the boss was telling me not to
But I won't stop until they get shot
When they get out the hospital
They gonna get shot, too
The fast one bringing that AK
Better walk, then we even
When I leave and flees to Cleveland
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace
So goodbye. We're shutting it down
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys
Cloning our sound, we found your town
Now is you ready for the war?
Cry loud and go
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep
And even oppose and order them hoes
Gonna flee with me?
Bitch, fuck with me then see that
My little aliens, yeah
We come to your city. Can they really
Put it on down with the pistol?
Can you feel me, feel me?

Verse 2:  Layzie Bone
They beat biters, dope-style takers
When I see you face-to-face
My nigga, I'm a treat you like a hater
You niggas ain't Bone, you clone
You wrong. What the fuck?
You niggas ain't thinking
What's the consequence?
Now I'm 'bout to get
Real deadly. Ready for the war
When we just start bombing shit
Trying to cop my click?
Hell no! Real raw. y'all niggas thought this was a game?
Now it's time to make you feel the pain
want to test my everyday thang?
I aim straight for your temple
It's really that simple when I seen it splatter
Had I even killed one of you clones
Then the rest of y'all wouldn't even matter
Scattered. Run for the border
Your career is getting shorter
Nigga, better hide 'cause I already warned ya
Mo Thug Records taking over
I told ya. Soldier man your post
Better cover your coast and lock all entries
If one of my sounds is off in your town
Then it's going down by the means infantry
Instantly finna be World War 3
If you fucking with my family jewels. You fools!
You niggas break golden rules
Gotta walk the walk in your own shoes
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Them niggas going platinum every time
I'm ready to ride. You ready to ride?
It's do or die. Then, nigga, I die
I jump in my Five Double-O
If you got it, better flaunt it
I'm a drop the top, and lock the locks
And cock the Glock; it'll make you want it
Come get it. And while you're rapping
On your song, just remember no pretenders
Bitch, you hoes ain't Bone!

Chorus:  Krayzie Bone
I hope you realize that you ain't Bone
You ain't Bone
Why don't you realize that you ain't Bone?
Nigga, you ain't Bone

To let 'em know that we're charging
Clones pay
Come on now ring the alarm (Ring the alarm)
To let 'em know that we're charging
Clones pay

Verse 3:  Bizzy Bone
Straight from the corner and I'm a thug
All my diamonds
I bet you wanted to stop my shining
Didn't we warn you, nigga?
The sign. See? Blinded
Run but they finding
Me in my Double-big-Five-O
And critical with a pistol
With pistols. Feel that the verbal 'll
Serve you. Heard my words
Are satanic and wishful
Then see you all get pissed off
My generals need no horse
We need are-15s, twenty Glocks
With beams, and TNT
Nigga roll with me
Burial. Fuck the world!
When I deal, hope I repented
'Cause if the world I resented
It just might catch me up in heaven
But I'm a work this earth til it hurts
Gotta done make the worse
All the way through trial
I'm back in the court for some dirt
Get 'em off soil. They wait for alarm
I curse that silly ass bitch said I stoled a purse
And at them bullshit awards. But they told me
I stole beneath of my shirt. And it makes me sick
Even Ripsta's sistas plus family understands
Fuck with it. Put it on your Grammy
Even my mammy's scared to tell. And
Deep in my mind, devil seeped in. Scary
Stay wary and carry on. Promise to burn me
Never bury and hurry if you ain't Bone

Verse 4:  Layzie Bone
These niggas want to erase me
'Cause they can't face me
Crash collide with the niggas that hate me
Fucking with the real, y'all see how the fake be
Ducking the cut, trying to look for safety
Make me reach for my pistol and pop it
Niggas gonna pay on the day that I spot him
Toss him in the trunk of the Caddy
On the way to the rodeo, killing all carbon copies
I'll be damned if I let a nigga breathe. Indeed
I grieve for the war. What's next?
It's all about respect, bitch nigga
I'ma get that shit if I don't get nothing else
To the end I'm steady flipping
Fucking the world til they give Bone props
Nigga, you got knocked on blocks
With rocks, beat down by the cops
And it still don't stop. Glock Glock
I'm grinding, steadily climbing
To the top of the charts. Where you want to be?
Off in my prime it's all about timing
As I look at my shit make history
No mystery. Mistook and, nigga
That eight-time platinum real
How do you feel to the thugs appeal?
Make nigga want to sound like Bone for a record deal
Should'a kept it real and quit fronting. Nigga
Go round-for-round with the best
Nigga, step up and meet your death
Fucking with Kray, Little Lay, Biz, Wish, and Flesh
Yeah, it's all about survival of the fittest and it's on
Nigga, realize, or you die. You bitch ass niggas ain't Bone

My overhead projects how ends meet to foul or ejected
Lyrics was selected beyond my control, last door on the totem pole
Pockets swoll from tape residue, last interview and went in daytime
It's made a promise to let down smooth criminals gently in my business
Grab your earlobe and billion, this is big business, buy tapes
Don't lend, niggas mad while I scrap change for phillies, why grill me?

Disownin' heads like Romans fight rebel Trojans

And promotions make me more potent

I shedded my last tear when I found out love was a lie
So I try, but it ain't nothin' for my mental

'cause we'll come to kill ya, now
We'll kill ya, now

[Krayzie]
Aw, triple-platinum, nigga, digga
And still thuggin' with the roughest muthafuckas 
in my city, and a nigga wonder, ""How they still chillin' like that? 
Ain't you scared of a nigga that's tryin' to jack ya paper, snatch ya?"" 
No, I really wish a nigga would turn and want to take what's mine
'Cause I got an AK-47 shootin' trey-O times
You didn't think I'm willing to find a way to say
""Oh, my!"" but check it out, though
I done made enough money to buy my ghetto a lot of weapons, y'all
And I made it, takin' out my weed. Here, stay high, nigga
So paranoia is factor when a nigga want to act up
Nigga figure I'm quiet, then he 1ook at my sawed-offs
And they figure they can try me
Like a muthafucka won't swang back or somethin'
Or even pull a nine out my jacket, and start dumpin'
Fuck 'em, I think a nigga see us on the video and playa hate 
And say that we ain't true to what we say
But then again, when you see us on the street and playa hate
We bang them fuckin' brains (we bang them brains)
But then, we switch subject
And fuck with them clones that suck the thug dick
Run around foul, tellin' people we stole your style
Muthafucka, we ain't never been in your town
It's all original when it's comin' from the Cleveland criminals
So here we go, got a gun - should I buck 'em on down? 
Or should I kill 'em when I put the instrumental on? 
Why they want to sound like Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh? 
I'm so full anguish
Gotta style so cold everybody and their mama want to claim it
But they can't get the hang of it
Yeah

Chorus

[Flesh]
Beat 'er up and you'll sleep when I step so stone-cold
I chalk 'em, coffin off and they frontin' that time 
That they shot a nigga straight to the temple
Done a little bit simpler to me and all bodies start steadily fillin'
Get real high, steady droppin' the time on 'em, time from time and again
Here to pick all that know with the Bone it's a party everyday
So say, ""Mo,"" and it's still this strong to brain
I hop on the phone with the homies to see what's happenin' in the hood
It's all good. Niggas, they thug us, smuggle
Roll so deep in they own cut, but they gon' sacks sellin' for life
If you pull a shyste off to the fiends
Then gank 'em and leave 'em hangin' for the sake of come up
Yeah, takin' ends, and we'll split ya, lost it in the stick up, yeah
We better shank 'em, thank 'em, fuck it, I thank 'em, and hope for respect
'Cause shit, he got sacrificed, my snatchin' a life in the midst of the dark 
And I sped off with the quickness, strikin'
Send a knife to the back of a playa hater, hate a thug
And they thought that I bruise easily
Come, they go through this little, (spin 'em)
Most of what goes around, comes around
Ooh, bla-bla-bloody mess even though hoes really want to test us
To the chest, Flesh buck buck, haters guess with a gun
They change in a whole new muthafuckin' attitude

Chorus

Nigga, let me in
Double glock and never about to change, man
To the temple I aim and claim to gain control
Fin to rid your soul, creep or roll
Put some pressure on these hoes that, yo
They pose as foes, gotta let 'em know
Got a nation of my niggas out to back me
Got another nation--killas out to try to jack me
Exactly, what the fuck you thought you was gon' pull? 
Fool, try to jack a St. Clair true, you lose, you lose
Nigga, I'm a tell you 'bout these haters distraction
They down with the puffin', the passin', 1ookin' for some action
Facts and stacks, never will my mission collapse
If you really want a thug, then you better pin these raps
And a I'm a give a little game in this world that we livin' in it
Sinnin' in it, and it really ain't free to me
You get it how you take it, but the only way you'll make it
Givin' peace to the G-O-D, your Lord
And it really don't mean that evil's gonna quit
Because the hater's gonna hate, and then the real - it's gon' feel
But I bet that after all of y'all fall 
that the faker's gonna perish in the fire
Dip, and you know when I'm rollin'
I'm equipped with the Ruger on my hip with the infrared beam
And I gladly put it on ya from the land of California
Leavin' all of y'all goners, if you know what I mean
Yeah, so quick to test us, jump off in the Lexus with K.B
We gonna take a little journey around the world and see what we see

Let me up in here and kill 'em
Feel 'em niggas want to bite the Bone, bite the Bone
Didn't a muthafucka say I'm wrong? 
Well I get down for mine, for my nine and blow
We shoot 'em up, buck
Yeah, strange we erupt on playa hation
Anybody hatin'? Erase 'em
And biters, everytime I see you on T.V.
it makes me feel good
'Cause I know when we run up on you
you'll see we, we gotta get paid good
Nigga, don't shit come for free in this land of poverty
Bone in harmony, we hungry
Since it's all about money, give Bone a little bit of that evil money
Don't gather the fly shit, fuckin' with Cleve, top of line in my Benz
Should I 1et 'em spin on all of y'all, 
should let my 20s spin on all y'all haters? 
Everything we write, I swear, it's all original
Niggas mad at Bone because we be all original (all original)

Rarely see ya on the daily mission
Keep your distance from the flames,
Maybe you can survive, forever and a day

Hell yeah
Got me flipping in the North Coast
Remember me,
The crook who wrote the book,
I'm off the hook,
Most of y'all niggas better take another look
Cause if ya player hate the Bone then yo life'll get took
So quit, never bringing ya no bullshit man,
Face to face it's that assassin gang
Bringing the heat, all y'all niggas bringing is lame,
But if ya wanna bring the pain, then ya gotta maintain
Coming in on another level,
I'ma put you on deck up at the top of the pile
Fake niggas wanna claim my style but Imma break em on down,
But you gotta come unique,
It's the thuggish ruggish sound
That you're looking for, or searching for
Everybody boy wanna be like Bone and stay high,
Little kids no longer wanna be like Mike,
That's right they trying to be like Bone and keep thugging for life
Getting ready for the end, dog
Wit my nigga Ken Dawg, hustlers, shifters and Tre,

The game, the fame, the fame, the fame, (fame)
What about those hoes, oh no
Little Easy fo sho to teach Bone,
And if he's wrong, well, he's gone
For my journey to keep me strong
But dear Lord I miss my peoples
And it just seems so evil,
And that I can't kiss my kids goodnight,
Put em to bed, tuck em tight
And catch some sleep and that's all right, that's all right,
I'll get mine, yeah I'll get mine
It'll take time, minimum crime,
Weed and wine'll be just fine
Got something buggin all of my peoples (what)
In the back of a Caddy
Jumping outta Caddies, spreading through alleys
In Cleveland and Cali like daddy and,
Oh, no, love, for double-a and double-a zero,
Really wanna get yo combo,
Said I'm ridding round in your boat

You niggas can't fuck, with
These Claire players, on top of the pile
And we roll this
Stand back, haters gonna be here for a while,
Can't ya hear the crowd screaming real loud?
And that's for Bone Thugs
Dear Lord, my sis has got Bone to look up to
And feel proud of, on top of all of that there
Mommy's out the ghetto now
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,
For everything it brings to me, yeah

I'm labeled a menace but I like it 
Destroy ya paranoia will make me blow you away but hey
Nigga got to close to me and that ain't how it's supposed to be 
Nigga want respect but what do you show me you 
Playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall
Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doin our best to obey god violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga gotta get up and go and get it if it's really coming
Now I got it and I'ma floor the niggas acting

So now if you hear me releasing some shells
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down on the darkside

and I fell in this fucked up state of mind
Slipped in the dream and I see demons telling me it's time to die
Why me I see some niggas they creeping outside my window
I'm ready to bang bang bang aim the 12 gauge pump let my lead go
Give it up for the bloody murda mo bloody murda mo mo
See a nigga when he go through the window had to put a bigger hole in his soul
If he get away running out my backdoor with me sawed-off swinging
Get ready to duck now to the guts buck pap pap pow

Now I know I done did some dirt in my time 
cause the devil was stressing my mind 
messing with my mind nigga
Bone don't know every day they lie 
Turn to realize that everyday I can do it if I only pray
Maintain cause a nigga was lusting
For money had to get it cause a nigga was struggling
I hit him with the Mossberg y'all heard about Mr. Sawed-Off 
Leatherface till them lay round after round after round
They'll fall down down
May they lay from the eruption man

Why declare war on these fakers and haters eliminate us, traitors ? 
These are the days of our lives (lives)
Do or die, (that died to Boo - he go bye)
Whom die they lie in the face of our society
Try at of every attempt to quiet me
I got a nation that's down to ride with me
Here's the deal, can I get a witness? 
It's deeper than survival
Who am I? My brother's keeper? 
Yeah, I be clutchin' on my Bible, willing to die
The wicked is near me
Dearly departed, but nobody hears me
Is we all gon' fall in misery? 
It's so serious, it bring tears to me
Ears to the street, like a drum to the beat, creepin' up my block
I'm already knowin' a nigga want to do me
So I stay strapped (Don't pose for the cop)
Crooked cops, they gonna harass me
Ask me the same ol' bullshit questions
Knowin' I'm a thug with bud for days
Keepin' a pistol in my possession
But a thuggish ruggish soldier like myself gon' move on
And prevail, avoid jail, collect my mill with my Bones, splittin' domes
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
Come on, don't make me hurt ya
Come on, come on, come on, come on, 
come on, come on, come on, come on, all about that bloody murder
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

Soldiers, I think we must be to O.G. ? loves thee
Mama plead my family tree never helped a mother come up
Seen it was hard tryin' to bring her sons up--they dwelled on the worse 
And ate nothin' for done up, comin' up, made it, eternal
If I struggle, thank God
I'm a count my blessin', trouble but never no stressin'
Just called it a lesson
'Cause life will be runnin' that test and better off in a cell
See a nigga walkin' the streets
And they label us foolish children
'Cause I always knew this
While the rest of my days I be livin' in Ruthless
Fuck what you're thinkin', law, my Judge is up Heaven
Look at my stomach and see the ""7,""
Even scales is how I'm bailin'
Rebellin', tellin' y'all nothin' but a soldier tells, 
critic can kiss my ass
I might go to thinkin' about my past
Get mad, I reach in my stash and blast
Fuck all y'all that treated a nigga like we wasn't shit
And soon as we hit, now what do we get? 
These fake-ass niggas tryin' to get in our click, all on our dick
But you can miss me, actin' phony in my presence, love it or leave it

Well, here it is, nigga. Here it is. What you gonna do with it?

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord
Know that I won't fly by that lesson
You taught me to pull out my Wesson you brought me
And I'm not stressing it softly
Get 'em up off me, cause all we
Wanted was harmony, been bombing em
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level
They can't stop me and pop me

I'll talk about 'em, and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em to not jump
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause
And I finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine

For the love of the lust, niggas busting on us
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge eruptions!

Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era. Paired up
With a nigga like Pac, and a nigga like me: gotta stay high

But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry
So I beg the Lord save us all: escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah

Here to get it, told my niggas they need get the hell
Down with the dirt, and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple a rounds, and if your passing through
Then hit the ground and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga

You can dig a hole; bitches is dead!

Want to follow fools through alleys

Probably St. Clair babies, so hate me

So lately I can handle my shady
Kill 'em, but we think I'm a bomb again
No leavin' as they put me in prison and give me time
I'm ready for the gun to go get'em
And I'm a fill 'em with eleven of mine and one die

Why so many fakers runnin' they mouth about shit and they lose
Lookin' so deep eyes, and tell it when they lyin'
Stop tryin', but they never convince none
Got hundreds runnin' up with gauges
Still I'm sure they sure they fryin' us, but I buck
Sometimes I save it, for me kill 'em off late at night
So, what if it got too late for me to get 'em?
Then gotta switch to testin' G's

Black nigga killa. Hate brought death around the block as a hollow point bust through the punk's back. Raisin' Cain, feel no 
pain as I penetrate. Nigga five deep as I strike at a quick pace. I got the evil of my dead nigga trapped in my mind so my soul 
is a threat to all mankind. Born to kill, I'm wicked by nature, 'cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hellraisers. A 
30.06 with the scope I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast. Muthafuckas catchin' heat as I bring anger, and 
release more danger from my chamber. The evil in my blood is possessed, so I creep low from the back slow and push lead 
through that nigga's flesh. Ain't no hope when every nigga wants to be the nine-milla, on the trigger, the black nigga killa.

We be the mighty warrior. Black nigga killa, what's up? You ready to die? You think you can fuck with them thug niggas? 
Come on, tell me the truth, nigga. Look in my eyes. Bitch, we get live. Bone thugs-n-harmony, nigga--Cleveland's thuggish 
ruggish niggas still down with the thug shit. Buck, buck, bust. Let 'em know we still run this bitch just like an assassin. Say, 
nigga, we nice but can get nasty. Get into war, what else can it be? Nigga, you know what we came here for. You know, 
when we shot through the door, my niggas was serious, playin no jokes. Just 'cause I'm a rapper, you thought it's for show? 
Okay nigga let's see if this a real fo'-fo'. You thought we was studio, saw us on video, seen us in person so here we go [here 
we go]. What is your problem? Here come the bullets, better dodge 'em. I sneaks up behind, so I'm fuckin' with killas.

ever know what hit 'em. I split 'em and snatch they soul like the Reaper. Have you ever seen a killer, dressed in a trench coat,

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was o.k
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus]
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it

Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights

Hit 'em up with a left, right, spot 'em with the beam

Nigga, the realer gravedigger, brew-swig and love bud
And if you think you can hang

And I don't give a fuck if you a crip or you a blood
But when you see a thug you better show some love

Got damn, it feel good to be a thugsta
Gettin' high, smokin' weed all day
Ain't got to listen to no bitches and I'm disrespectin' laws
Just doin' it the Bone Thug way
Yeah, nigga, you gotta be crazy fuckin' with Layzie
And all these Mo Thug killers
We them ex-dope dealers and natural born cap peelers
Feel us nigga, if you want ain't of that high captain here

We kickin' that raw shit
Fuck the law shit, been screamin' it for years
Ain't no fear in my heart thanks to the Lord up above
And I got a grudge against niggas that judge, give 'em no mercy, no love
Let me see you shoot that motherfucker shoot that nigga
Ride up, slip the clip in, any trippin' niggas spit that fire
We don't need no water, let this motherfucker burn, baby
And I know they hate me say lately, Layzie actin' shady

Hey, I'm the number 1 assassin, guess they just can't understand
I fear no man, put it on my number 1 fan
'Cause I'm a stand-up true thugsta in a league of my own
The city of Thieves is my home and I don't trust nann nigga
My mentality is thug, runnin' the streets sellin' drugs
Off this nigga gettin' buzzed packin' heat off in the club
Nigga what? Nigga what?
They sayin' that Bone was split up

Just niggas jealous tellin' rumors and lies
Can eat a dick up, nigga

Nigga, stay real
Thugs get high
Why you call yourself a thug?
That's how I feel inside
And we don't wanna hurt nobody, 'body
But your fuckin' with us and we shootin' up the party
Even if you was talkin' some of that Bone shit we sayin'
Then you can bring it on because we ready, we ready

Fuckin' with us is like fuckin' with no condom
That's dumb, better play with your son
Nigga, I ain't the one
Ain't a thang changed, niggas still the same, made a little change
Sendin' bullets to brain, fuck around man
Nine millimeter come and get some, get some
Shoot 'em with them hollows 'cause you know he's got his vest on
And you didn't want it to come to this, did you?

Fuckin' with them thugs, them niggas roll through
If you really want some run
(Better run)
Fuckin' with thug niggas run, run
Yeah say nigga come on
We ready for combat but y'all ain't ready
Carry a deadly machete, shred 'em, they stretched
Now they human spaghetti

Steady smooth and very eager to bury enemies
If it be necessary, then nigga wet 'em
(Go)
And I better go get 'em
We pickin' 'em off with the heater 9-millimeter
Shit to sweep the streets make niggas retreat
That's heat
Now, I repeat if you want some nigga come and get it

'Cause we still five live and vicious
Don't get it twisted motherfucker
Run up on us whenever ya wanna get down and dirty
Still stand in the Land with the slugs and my gun in my hand
Krayzie, Layzie, bizzy, wish and flesh
Put it down to the North, South, East and West
From back in the day we claimin' the thuggish ruggish
No need to change it

Now everybody a thug
If you real throw it up but if it's fake
Kill 'em and put 'em in with the rest of them phonies
Fuck 'em and yes it's like that

Always, always, what am I? What am I?
A thug always, 'ways, 'ways
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Always, always, what am I? What am I?
A thug always, 'ways, 'ways
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Always, always, what am I? What am I?

Fuck with the niggas with the guns and you might get shot, get shot
Get cha gun, get cha gun, did you kill 'em all?
To death, death death
You could be the first to feel the heat 
To see how much we got, we got 

I still be the thuggish ruggish nigga
Dressed in all black khakis, fatigues, and boots
Still don't give a fuck about the law
Still run with a pump in my car
And fuck who you are
You're fucking with a couple of niggas that's really insane
I'm talking loco, crazy as hell
It ain't just a name
It's the game
And we done loosened up a couple strings
And shook a couple of screws loose in my brain
Besides that, ain't nothin' changed
Look at me now I'm still a thug
Nigga I still smoke bud
You know I still represent St. Clair wig split shit, nigga what?
This is Bone Thugs niggas 
Thinking I told you but we put it down like that
And whoever we got to fuck up to prove that we do it
And keep on moving, guess who's back up in the house?
Original Cleveland Criminals
Niggas just send em subliminal messages like ""murder, mo murder murder""
Never forgot where we come from
Watch how you move your tongue
Cause I got niggas that's ready to jump off in your ass

Protect my niggas for combat

Quickly the reaper peep you
Sweep you off your feet in Cleveland

But nigga you fuck with me then I'm a fuck with you
Introduce you to this heat
I sweep the street
When I draw down, let me hear you say ""fuck the law now""
Rawest niggas in the town
Ready to thug and go down
Go pound for pound, nigga that's the motto
Let me see you throw them things and if it's real
Nigga keep it real
Show me your game
I'm sure gonna claim
What the fuck is mine
My nigga I'll take it
Grab a player hater by the neck, choke him out and try to break it
Gimme your money, drop them keys
It's a jack move bitch
And since you haters ain't got no business
That's how we attack your shit
Nigga we'll smack your bitch in the middle of the Grammy
And the media might ban me

Pull it up, sit up, get up and count up your money
Before it all gets spent up
And you want to get rid of
A hood bitch with game
And every bitch said I'm a good bitch
Fucking with the wood grain
Everybody still playing that hood game quiet
Especially when it's tired
My environment ain't nothing but niggas dying
In them chemical fed injections in Jasper Texas
Split up these niggas off in different sections
Don't hate my message
Destiny led to mimic
Chastity for my daughter
Wad up a niggas sherm 
And come listen to the sermon
Swerving in my Surburban, lick it up with the bottle
But everybody know I got some problems
Had dreams of the Apollo
The fiends had faith in me, suckers wouldn't run
A nigga not insane
Niggas still with me
Bone, somehow they turn up
Run up and get your sign
Run blindly, elevate through time
Nowhere to hide

Our dawgs finna haul off lead
Sawed-off head
Nigga you dripping soaking with bloodly body be begging me
You know what you should've capped like 2pac with a glock
They're deadly, better not upset my thug mentality sucker
You know you done fucked up
Don't you niggas?
Runnin up blastin gas craters
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky?
Could it be a bird or maybe it's even a plane
For the untamed
Insane human only the Fifth Dawg
Fuck you thought motherfuck fame
For the fact the shit is a phat game
Going remain number one in the Land

I dropped five guards in the name of the Lord I say
Now how many times will I have to slay today?
Will I raise my gauge?
Oh God!
How will I teach yea, but it's these tactics that he daily practice
They gonna let you
Don't have it?
Have it, running up you sons of bastards
Blast it, we sons of assassins
Match it, collecting more cash
That's true, you're feeling that
Niggas said all my babies get a million
Struggle with a villain
Hit 'em
With a venomous blow!
I call on my mighty archang-el
Gonna surround my soul but go with the calico yo'
We the tightest you know Mo, the Mighty
Yes trues humbly united

For the FBI you want to come test my enterprise?
Bitch you better go think twice
And open up your motherfucking eyes
These niggas can't fuck with the fifth dog finna parlay

One, two look at the tally they drew my picture with Bob Marley
They probably want to kill me will I die in 1999 smoking phillies
Bizzy the kid was bustin' in the ceilin' in my big claim
Kickin' on something and dig this
Got to feel it catch and don't let go
Wretched in a fro
Bone watching for the po, po
Roll over then pull it got my bullet in my fo, fo
I gotta stand it's turnin' to a jungle (Green Bay)
Comin' out a four door Benz and I spend a lot for show
No no don't spend a lot contend with a men
Lookin' at my watch like a meal ticket
Arrest the block they couldn't pin it better send it
For the cops absorb you soul of course

Murder Mo, Curly I heard it lower and return it burn 
When our niggas still shermed out
Court's adjourned! Court's adjouned! 
Rest and burn!

[Layzie]
I can't sleep at night cause I lay in my bed
And I be tossing and turning trying to avoid my dreams
And I can hear the niggas letting off they lead around the corner
Got me feelin paranoia like they coming for me
And I be clutchin' my heat, got me pacing back and forth
So much shit on my mind, so many things to do
So little time a nigga really got to do it in
Man I be ready for war in my fatigues and boots
From the minute nigga step outside
Nina Ross on my hip and I got to pack one
Just like Little Eazy-E told you and me
Nigga never leave the house without packing a gun
And that's real leave it for the dollar bill
Niggas'll holler ""Kill Kill"" then start flexin'
When the shit poppin' off in my direction
Nigga got a 17-shot for protection
Life ain't no joke
Too many niggas I know was takin' shit for granted and that's foul
Nigga if you see a fool, pick a fool right out the crowd 
And hit him dead in his mouth for being loud and wild
Shit is real
Ain't none of that elastic fagot rubber band plastic shit
Motherfuckers in the battle zone blasting shit
Put the match on shit straight up gassing shit

[Krayzie]
Hell yeah! It's that same nigga runnin' with the AK-47
Busting niggas in the belly
Give them motherfuckers more than just a headache
Get back at that nigga faster than FedEx
They're running retreating screaming Mayday we're going down
Now why the fuck is niggas telling lies and rumors? 
Talking about we split up
Cause I see Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Niggas really need to shut that shit up
If a motherfucker really want to rumble we can tumble
We wilder than any animal that's in the jungle
The name of the game is block the basket, strike him out
Hit the goal make the quarterback fumble strategize
Any nigga hatin' ain't a friend of mine
Nigga considered the enemy niggas that's when you die
I never keep my enemies close
Cause I got a perfect view of 'em in my scope
That's close enough
Leather Face'll fuck a nigga up and smile
And hit 'em with the millimeter
And I show a bitch kill a nigga see me driving
Bitch come on and try to rob me
I'm willing to bet that 'cha get lit up
Get off of me baby (baby), 
Keep on comin' and there's gon' be drama (drama)
Telling you niggas you better not fuck with me
Cause I ain't that quiet nigga that I used to be
Look how the haters give a nigga attitude
Nigga sick of being humble now I'm like fuck that I gotta get mine
They try to show a nigga love, but fuck that it ain't no love
Cause in the game you get fucked every time
Got this feeling inside my bloodline
Somebody finna get fucked up! If a nigga don't get some satisfaction
Blastin' like a madman
Gettin' with the static nigga loving the action
Yeah My Bone Thug niggas come on
If any one of you niggas got any problems
Thinkin' you tough and you really want to solve 'em
Don't be mumbling speak a little louder
While you steady talkin' like you liver than the next nigga
We'll already be up in you now hater feel us 
Who the realest The Bone Thug killas
If there's any objections niggas deal with 'em
Realer than them other motherfuckers talkin' about they thugs
Jumpin all on the bandwagon
Want to be like us, want to cuss, want to bust they guns
Thugged out with they pants sagging they actin'
But when it's really time to show some tactics
The niggas don't have 'em
We murdered the bastards, putting 'em all in bodybags and caskets
Drop 'em in the river, splash that's that ass
Cause when we clash ain't no coming back
Huntin' niggas from the past
We gon' settle this shit right here
Fight to whoever blood be spilled first
Who will be the nigga ridin' away in a Hearse? 
Not me I'm determined to wake up and still be livin' in the morning you 
Feeling me
Quicker than a clocked damn missile
Hit a bitch directly in the middle, right between your eye
Then we makin' sure that nigga die
Shoot a couple more times and ride out (ride out, ride out)

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely, so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend
But I predicted this ending, back in the day
Cause I had visions of bad decisions knew niggas would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still want to make the loot
No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain;
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail, you play 'em wrong then you fail
It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved, everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw
And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We split up, we tied up, my nigga whats up with that
Letting the devil get in, to the pen
Devils pretending to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass
Should of stuck the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfucking snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died
All of my niggas came to the church
And thanks for coming, I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsing
But I'm still rapping get it all off my chest
So I came back to the action
When the bird was flying, low, and laughing
Family bashing 'til it just happened
Then Wally passed, and he asked me, ""Wasn't it tragic?""
Louie asking me if he'll ever come back so hard
We tell the truth, no use in beating around the bush
Baby I'm sorry.. it's all in the game
Throwing up blood, fuck it Layz'
Let's sign our life away

Now see me? I ain't giving up a motherfucking thing
It's hard to come by, and I ain't no bitch nigga
Shit been in some robberies and walk-bys
And you don't want that, neither do I
But I will, I will, cause I'm a hustler, hustler
High 'til I die, I'm goin' get mine
Even if it mean murder, getting caught, fuck it let me fry
Know it's hectic, niggas start shit nowadays..
But I'm a hustler just like you, don't bring that shit my way

In the streets gotta get that good life
Selling that yea up under the street light

Here they come, wait can I barktalk Bone, jumping it feeling
Better now, better hit 'em with the future shot
But feeling like Pac, that's what the guy thought
But this shit don't stop, I send much love to the pop
Dropping this shit today, we kicking this thug music
Better love us, so when I love smoking buds on the bus
See we gone sells out that'll make you lust
My nigga don't play too close, my thugs in heaven and shit
My niggas'll pop with the pistols, and snap out the holsters
And cover a snitch all wet
Why the fuck could not he write me S-E-T for the second sincerely
We bagging 'em up rolling niggas and throwing 'em in the wasteland
Soldier, told ya nigga we gone have our time
Like daughters in heaven don't tell him, on his knee
He's fell, he better hope he don't fall victim

Verse 1:

Now why did they kill him
It's one of my niggas is dreamin' schemin on making a million
Tryin' feed they children and police keep coming around
And keep tryin' to beat you down, and take you out
Nigga don't worry God don't like evil
Shit is so clear that they can't even see through
But no matter what we do (matter what we do),
We gon' be strugglin' forever running forever
The hood that I seein' it won't get no betta
Until armageddon goes down it's not a legend
It's kinda hard to view, paradise,
But if you just try close your eyes you can view it
But reality hits you soon as you open your eyes you find
That you still live a fucked up life
And the streets done took over your mind
Figure you gotta survive, so somebody got to die
You just want to break down and cry
But asking God to come help us please, why?

Verse 2: Wish Bone

Some ah y'all niggas really can't fight
Betta get it together getta act right
Cause when you fuck wid Bone
Betta come wid somethin' betta have you shit right
And don't be planning no future on nuthing you heard, nigga,
He say she say get you fucked up killa
And I'm gon' ride, won't lose no sleep over nuthin'
You can save it friend
But all these years,
Face to face ain't nobody said nuthin'
Livin' in these wicked days
Tryin' to get over my wicked ways
Time after time I know we tried
But losing this life everyday
And I don't want to go out like that not me,
Lately Bone got what you want
Physically you don't want to bleed
A la la la la la la
Hit 'em hard it's gonna  be alright,
Alright alright

Verse 3: Bizzy Bone

And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
And don't you worry bout, a damn thang,
Wid all odds, against us
When the guard got me running for the fences
Aiming at these henchmen litigate shells
I'm teaming my clip wid the extra extension
I sit in my basment like it's a crackhouse bored,
Blackout cause I was paranoid, he enjoys what I avoid
The courts ah bowl ah, crooks
Cause bitches want the money on ya books
Destroy double eyed dotted watch devil smiles wid a cush
Gotta sell chronic to get me up some mellofied timing televised
The crucified promised in ah my ish nobody can stop us
Where the shoot out?
How many niggas you killed?
How many niggas for real?
Like Mary Louelle as long as I live
Forty five strategized like,Ohh dow,
Niggas can blast at me
Bitches can pass me,
Fuck ah chicken and let's get on

Hook

Verse 4: Flesh N Bone

I remember like yesterday
Way back in the day coming up
Moms used to read to me everyday
Through the evening even through the afternoon
In the dawn ah book of songs,
So I'm wondering off through the wilderness
Somewhere in the valley of the shadow of death
Want to hunt me down all the need for people
Heaven I wonder will the devil catch me shall prevail
Lately even heaven is flashy sick of this amazed envy
And it ain't nuthin' to see and believe in heaven in front of you
That's what I'm having a de ja vu
Lord when I lay down down to sleep
I pray for the Lord and the Holy Ghost bless my soul to keep,
And if I should die before I wake up wake up wake up wake up
I pray for the Lord to have mercy on our souls oh please Lord take us
I say to my momma peep no no more crying drying eyes
Nigga locked up at wayside
Couldn't even pay respect to my stepdad when he died
So finally got a release bid and I slide back to the county
Back to the 5-5 ride fore I touch back home
Don't worry bout a damn thang
Everything finna be al-right
Off to the door so bright like a knight in shining armour
Hug my wife my sons my daughter
Ain't no more reason to even bother

Hook

Verse 5: Layzie Bone

Look nigga I ain't worried bout nothing
Cause it's a little thing I know called faith
All you need is much as a mustard seed
And the Lord will keep you safe
Whateva don't kill you will make you stronger
I promise you that just keep on pushing,
If you slip you fall and you hurt yourself
Then the Lord will provide your cushion
Determination, rules the nation whateva you facing just be a man
Believing in death before dishonor shake the drama and take a stand
For ah nigga like me see it didn't come easy
Ah nigga had to struggle and fight
At ah point and time in my life
It's like ah nigga just can't get it right
To all of my family Layzie loves ya
And I never take shit for granted
Feeling so wicked off in this planet
Man fuck tryin' to understand it
That's why I stay focused thugging and loc'dus
Stacking my bricks till I form the fifth
Momma never said it'd be like this
But nigga I'm ready for anything,
Remember to never count your eggs before they hatch
About precision timing and vision
Get up and go and don't turn back
If you ah soldier and you know it hold ya head up high
And keep stompin' in yo big black boots and don't worry

As you can see I took the pill (I took the pill), right to the house
Grabbed a shot of liquor and pop, pop, popped it in my mouth
And I'm thinking to my self that this might be a waste of my time
'Cause what if I don't even get high
Thirty minutes done came by, I didn't even seem high
Until I stood up and looked at the ceiling for some reason
Now I'm tweaking, then I tried to walk but I was slow

Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this?
I'm looking at my home girl like I want her, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumbling
And I was trying to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumbling
Fall off into something, but I guess I'm on a mission
Telling my niggas that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listening
Whistling, hanging out the window, need me some indo
'Till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at the door
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded

And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain (Brain)
Ah, why should I, just to get high, weed gets me high (Weed gets me high)
""Nigga try this here,"" they said ""better then that there""
They say, ""ya like it (ya like it)"" so I tried it (I tried it)
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny

People ask me how do you maintain
You got to keep your mind on money (T-H-you-G)
Don't let the snakes ever short you for ya change
Nigga, let 'em know how much you want it

[Krayzie]
Nigga 1993, hooked up with Eazy-E
1994, rushing through the door with the Bone flow
Nigga was creeping on a come up, doing it for the love of money
1995 we really let 'em know, Cleveland is the city where we come from
Brought styles motherfuckers never heard before
But we never got our props 
'til we dropped that said song, see you at the crossroad
But the man know, Eazy running with the lost souls, rest in peace
That was 1996, we back in the mix
I guess they thought that we'd gon' quit but we got love for this shit
But everything started changing, business rearranging
Then the time when Bone and Ruthless wasn't vibing
Tried to keep my mind together through that industry shit
Somehow I'm feeling like what I deserve I didn't get
But I'ma stick it out, believe I'ma keep my head up
And show my loyalty for Eazy E, even though I'm fed up
1997 hey, everybody grab ya weapon, its the art of war
It don't stop, it won't stop until we drop, body rott
Not to mention when we venture through the family scriptures
1999 nigga, still struggling
Trying to get some money with this mastermind I'm juggling
Sharpen up ya thug mentality
And by the year 2000 I'll be thugging, but so immaculate
I gotta get some money, blast if I get hungry
So if you read that I done flipped, then you know the story, about me

[Chorus]

(Ed. note-I'm not too sure about any of this verse)
Take a good look into my eyes, and all over my face your bloody death
With a bloody bloody, mess, I'm serving you none the less
? that crazy motherfucker from the world's most dangerous group
Mo Thugs Nation, ? on your life
That's absolutely what I'm gon' do
Blast at them niggas who thought they knew me
Now I'm that motherfucker that be ?, the nigga that bust all y'all
My mission in life to be the coldest nigga that ever spit shit on the mic
I'm coming in smooth, rocking this hip-hop music just the way you like
Telling all biters to please stop trying
Let it go fry fool, when I make my move all y'all gonna die
Split up and fry, open his eyes ? pop, 
Shot one through his head
Oh my, oh my, now look what you made me do, this nigga dead
It ain't my fault, you niggas too soft, ain't got no skill
Now look through the ?, stop steel
Y'all some fake-thug living tryna get notice by hanging with stars
No need to say no names, niggas know who the fuck you are
We all true sound, nigga united gathering souls, how we roll
And that's love for the paper, folding, I saw these hoes
But I had my ?, nah nigga that's my nuts ? don't touch that
And then he won't hesitate to buck for the love
You can't dust on these bustas, so they die
They only got love for those who love me
In the meanwhile I main to keepin my mind on my money
And no, this shit that we spit ain't funny
Especially when you hungry, nigga
With no hustle, nigga, to get them funds

[Chorus]

In '91 I'm running from the fucking cops, don't ya know it
That bitch was trying to find a hiding spot, he show it
Know niggas that'd had no pussy
Said that would never read or get to L.A.
And niggas went cannibal on 'em, either
Smoking that reefer, niggas know how I'm living
'Cause I was having children when y'all was looking for women
But mine aside, so why you telling your same ?
When niggas ain't have shit, tell me who's the one that ride
We gon' ride ride though, you can call me Mr. Murda-mo
Get ?, burn the whole store down all by myself
? for fucking with the Bone flow
Heaven and Earth, God and my loved one, and ya gotta roll
And what you want my people to hear, that I'm a fucking sell-out?
But who's the one on solo shit, and who want me the hell out?
I'll bail out with a ?, that pussy makes me change
Or expansion on the mansion or acres in the shooting range
Shooting things (shooting things), it don't make you a villain
The villain is chillin with his children
Bitch, I keeps it real!

I keep my mind on my money, my money on my mind
A straight up soldier in the field out here pushin my line
Nigga designed a gold crime as I'm racin through this obstacle
007, Layzie Bone, knew it was possible
Got shot, got out the hospital, started on my mission
Listen, nigga pay attention
Oh, and did I mention, had a tape before I crept on a come up, Faces of Death
Blessin 40 o-z's, Lay and Leather face and double Z's ?
Niggas often wonder why my mind on my money
Nigga these bitches all up on me, and half the industry phoney
It's like this nigga, I don't even fuck around
If a nigga ain't got no money for Lay, I'll come around
Ain't it funny how niggas turn funny-style
When they think they fall in trinkets, ain't even ran a mile
See my niggas doin a damn thing, Flesh
Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls, just to let you know
Heaven's Movie, yours truly, Mr. Gambini
(Krayzie)It's the mentality, and next to the baddest, little Stevie
And when you ask me how I maintain
I watch my niggas rule, act a fool, and ace the game
Mo Thug one, witness the Family Scriptures
Mo Thug two, Family Reunion comin to get ya
Mo Thug three, presentation of the mothership
Niggas on some other shit, by smoke and maintain

Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan

Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates
Or will I burn off in that lake now,
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake

Weak niggas fronting like the strong guys fucking with them Bone guys 
Nigga you die,you die'm that sneaky little nigga still off the hook 
Off the chain and a motherfucking wire

Ain't got no direction and don't know which way to go 
Nigga save your soul cause we all gotta struggle or strive 
And that's called survival 
It's vital nigga better know what to die for 
Living in the battlefield it's all about respect and honor 
Niggas be strapped with the gats and armor 
Ready for whatever nigga fuck the drama bitch what? 
We can make a mil take a mil tell me how that paper feel

But that's a whole other song and y'all don't leave it alone!

Murderous, somebody noticed when I strike through the killing fields, dead! 
T-Rock done got shot got a glock for the nigga are-tillery shop 
Drop when the nigga pop and the party don't stop till they call the cops! 
Somebody get with the bacardi, got to get to the block 
You know it's me and my niggas, all the guerillas, killas

Somebody was drinking from the back of the lamb 
Somebody was spittin' ammunition in the radio-even in Zion (Zion)

Such a heavenly feelin' I get when I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin' I'm going insane, and I really wish we can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam
You heard enough, you heard it all, nothin' but a, a really thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I'm out in front makin' my scrilla
I'm happy to know , the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me
You rippin' the bone like me, can get it as long as me

And when I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and every day I wake
Niggas rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in my drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'

Its my world, its my thang
The way she penetrates my brain

All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes, stopped my horse,
Whoa Nelly!
Who in the bushes, you better speak up,
Or I'm-a let my shotgun's song sing out.

Who's this?
Hope this ain't the law, draw out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun.

Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry.
Took a step back 'cause it could get dangerous.

Please don't shoot it's just me Thug Queen Horse Stealer.

Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes

I'm wanted in four counties, for armed robbery,
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men with my head,
Stole two horses, thought you was the law that's why I jumped in the bushes.

Goodness. Now she was hotter than a barrel of fire but
I could use her for the job so I told her to ride, come on.

May I ask you what you headed to the west for?

I got a partner got a plan for some dough and if you're down
You can pick up yourself a pretty penny.
Be in town in a minute now be sure if you're with it.

We be up before the sun rise got a stallion here for your partner
To ride hit the saloon before the moon shine down
For whatever let's ride let's ride.

These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk,
And meet my boy in the morning for details 'n hookup.

You better count your money
You better count your money (Ghetto Cowboy)

Rise 'n shine, good morning, howdy.
Nine o' clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley.
Now I dun came a long way and I don't wanna be late.

Tell him I'll make it to him, you know we ain't.

Move out, giddy up giddy up giddy up

You better count your money (Ghetto cowboy)
You better count your money

I'm peepin' Krayzie's 'Wanted' poster in the saloon,
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon.
Glanced across the room I seen this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up tonight I think that Krayzie just might take his life.
So I approached him and I paused.
Look man, I really don't wanna brawl, but won't you chill before them laws,
Come messin' up this master plan,
Since he already rowdy I'm just asked the man (Dang)
You want some work well partner put in your bid
And by the way now what's your name, they call me Layzie the Kid.

The name's Powder Pete, can I get a twelve gauge!
Outlaw every day, on the front page.
Mister Kid, if you give me the low down me and Blackjack,
Be ready for the showdown, with two double barrels pointed at whatever,
We'll stick together, I'm pretty clever.

So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon because it's all goin' down.
I heard the guy runnin' the bar screamin' 'Krayzie's in town.'

Now when we get to this saloon, you don't worry, wait outside.
Don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses.
Stepped inside the bar.
Layzie Kid you son of a gun!

Hey man I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun.
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun.

Howdy

Mighty glad to meet ya son.
Oh yeah, you know I also brought a friend along, meet Thug Queen,
The horse peddler, straggler, just met her.

Howdy partner, already got the horses saddled up.

I hope you're good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up.

Now y'all, it's gonna be gettin' dark real soon.

And after my niggas was busting we probably was looking for trouble

When they east dog coming from the shoulders
And the older niggas they told us

Got glocks to show you this muscle
Get the money little nigga don't struggle

I knew it would of been on
We would of been tight
We would of been in the zone ridin' so high
Up in the game fire, does, lie
See we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it (Right)
But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now

Hope nobody knows just too much

When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave
Not one of the slaves
And I'll be one of the same, stay hatin' the fake
On the television runnin' 'round tellin' niggas be ready for hate
Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
The smell of right it's all about guarding, guard the weak
Lost mommy, poppy left home
I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie
Sit list in the back tellin' his selection
His date is probably

And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You might have through somethin' hopin' nothin' like Bone
Like one said we'll never make it
Like two, thirty mil in they faces
Crossed over, back to the hood we souljahs
The music nigga make it back, scandlous
But faith kicked in and the world shows and we winnin' now
Gotta keep it comin' fool in my baby's mouth
And things have changed like relationships
Ain't did nothin', now you want to flip
Suin' people things you would've never made on your own
Now I want to stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood
Bye, think I'm home
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone
You can really help a buster if it ain't meant to be

there's no doubt that god helps me rise
[That he do, that he do]
 
I said indeed if I fall. Every time I'm fallin', fallin
there's no doubt god helps me rise
[That he do, that he do]
 
[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
With every day bullshit I'm goin' through 
I be hopin' to make it through another day
Lookin' for another day to live my life
And please get away
I stay high
With my gun paranoia so if they come
Then I dump, dump, dump
That really all I got for ya, this life is crazy 
I might go Krayzie if I'm down, don't let them break me
So I stop and I pray to god, O lord forgive my worthy life
And help me through this pain of mine 
 pray and I pray I pray
That I could just see the light a fly away, away, away, away
But I know I can call on when I'm all alone
When ever I fall, fall, fall
 
[Chorus] 2x
 
[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Situation got me thinkin' was it worth this
And then it got me thinkin' cause I love this
Stay down and it'll work ya self at time don't be a slave by these choices in life
Everybody wants that miracle just so far from where I go and if its meant to be 
Then it comes fa show, fa show [ya know]
And I know, I know it gets hard some times 
But don't you give up its going to be better times if you believe just believe
 There's no tellin' what you receive 
If in proof just look at me, look at me, look at me
And you got to love this gift we been blessed with. I do
Number one and nobody can touch this you know
Gotta hit my knees and let them know I thank you wit out you
Where would I be 
Where would I go
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Ain't no tellin' what this life is bout' to bring
One day ya here the day next ya gone
That's way I try to live right
Don't want to live wrong
And no guarantee you gon' make it home
What go around come around
Everybody know its real when you speakin' tha carma
So do on to others like you want to be done like Mary J no more drama
Ima paper chaser believe that walkin' on the ground is where I plat my feet at
If it's not bout money don't need that
You can keep that gossip can't you see that
Stay locked on my mission 
'cause most of these niggas in the world ain't thinkin' bout the future
Young black entrepreneur
And I'm out to get more
So baby open the door 
Nigga gotta let me in 'cause I'm getting it again
And I said I was going to get dollars
And if it's not about cheese I holla
Fuckin' with a nigga that's way to pollish
And if the road get to rough imma stand my ground
Keep my faith and call on the lord
And I don't hafta worry no more
Even if I fall
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Imma be a soldier 
Runnin' from gun shots for the day I see Jehovah
You think you know us
Even though you want to
Don't think I'm in it just because of crossroads
And grab a grammy and did nothing for my family
This artist is half ass and scared to tell the truth
And I'm heartless niggas and I think he's raising to you
To the fo who thought that someone was bullshitin
And admitin' you sayin' anything
Up lifting within' the distance that the kids that use to listen to the don 
Better prepare old English and essents of a mission never relied on county and prison
Messin' up my kitchen
Better be survive in you
Treated  these prisons 
Trinity is wating for you

And let me get a ride

Thangs can get rough, when you live in the ghetto
You gotta survive, no matter the pain
Nigga be hurting, life'll be hurting
But nigga for certain, this is the game
Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, went to throw it at em
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollars
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'ma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

Thug style motherfucker, live forget ends
I'd never testify, Satan can't divide my piers
No weakness inside my fears
Drop tears, for niggas that died
I'm gonna safe divide, mind gone
And I think I'm running out of time
The god damn baby's daddy
And I'm gonna damned to hell, if I don't abide
and that's why I yell, B-E-N-Z we ride
Straight to the corner, down to the side
In the B-E-N-Z we
Roll around the corner with the F-O-R-T
S-C-V, and a nigga can't fuck with me
Not even the devil with B-O-N-E

I'm here to get that money keep it coming, show me love

It's harder to get, I'm serious not playing that's the pay wits
The streets have come back, real fast on that ass feel me
Cause I don't want to be broke no more
Standing in front of the liquor store with rocks no more
Cause my man, never had nothing to done that
It's like reversing time on my mind I can't go back, fuck that

I came up a nigga that never had nothing but hard times
I was always grinding, and talking up out of the hood
Into the bullshit, but I'm surviving
I got to get me some money man, put it down for the General
A nigga'd rob your ass, if I caught a nigga flossing cash
What it was four niggas, and we punk niggas
But you no niggas got us scared, a couple more green
To get up for everything reach the scene, clean
And we was the niggas that stood on the block
With a couple of rocks and a glock with the cops
Can't nobody have the nuts to say our name
They call me the Dummy Man
I'm sell him a fat twenty piece and then I reach for the bomb
The things they get awfully man
want to see what I put them shit come
Took em for they last dollar, holla
Man I ain't giving a fuck it's do or die
So get on the ground, lay it down
Give me some money my nigga POW

They come to find out, ain't even one of my children
You illin, playing with these kids man
You're dead wrong, got this baby calling me daddy

I ain't lying, I ain't no deadbeat daddy, with intent to be neglecting
All I wanted was some sex, but now she trying to get a check
But baby hold on won't you wait a minute
The DNA a read negative, fucking these chickens ain't no way to live
They trying to get up in your pockets and break you down
For 18 years, so who raping who now
Ninety-nine point nine percent not

With all that bullshit you stressing me with, testing my wits

Sadly, always in transition leaving gladly
Shit, I tried to be the papi
Nothin 'gainst the baby, momma can't make me happy

So you can cancel that money!
Ridin'!, and flossing my money!
Oh, I know you had a plan, lovely!
I hope the real baby daddy live his life, y-eah!
And you can tell your little girlfriend to stay out my face
I see you ain't told her the results of what you got in your case
You get's nada, what you ain't heard
I ain't the real baby's father, not a dollar

Remember you always got love from home
They steal this pain and may not know it
I'm a boy and I gotta show it
I hear them cries from the babies
I wish they had a chance don't want to blow it
But unemployed for all the little girls and boys
You got'sa, love your mom and daddy
And make them wonder why you give them ploys
Oh boy, its getting deep but more expensive then ever cheap
But what about that little nigga running the streets
Making a living through his beats
What about these whack ass politicians
They don't care if we live or die
What about that elderly barely breathing, gotta survive on SSI
They say America, it's the land of the free and home of the brave
It's mass hysteria, so bring your knees and hope we can fight
And if bury us, at least we can live as we believe

Know we gone, how they sleep at night if they know they be lying
This shit we deal wit', we young black and fit less
Living in the ghetto to ghetto and ghetto
to ghetto cause ghetto is all we know
They beat us down for dumb shit, they lock us up for dumb shit
Find out that I'm innocent and still gotta fight for money they owe me
And they wonder why we riot in the damn streets
They can't hold us down we getting all that money
And watch what I tell ya, everybody wants some
How they get it they don't care
Try to kick it when you spittin' real smooth
But they listening in my business trying to fuck up my move

Dead niggas I've been to war
Been tall with shit I seen it all
Like soap operas from ghetto stars
I can tell when rappers getting bored, really
Sometimes she a bitch sometimes my lady
And times when niggas die she help like I was a baby
The simplest things in life were always the best
Breathing your ass back inhaling when chronic in your chest
Hey somebody call my momma and help me one more time
Before I die my momma she carry me no comma

Cops not even checking on me, juvenile delinquent
And baby y'all be respecting me

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?)

What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago
And that's just like a nigga want to take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't want to say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder motherfuckers in a deadly way
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?)

And a nigga want to test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin'
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?
I know y'all niggas want to roll with pros, and make friend of foes
But we chosen, God done blessed us with His potion
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remember, eternal, it means for everlastin'
Number one assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'
All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong

True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killers, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double time
And it's like that, you won't get
Come and get some pap, pap
Want to sound like?
Want to be like? Nigga, we can't have that
Why a nigga want to bite the bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the forty four mag, I'm glad
'Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a body bag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with

Let me tell ya somethin', nigga, if the fire's started
I'm the nigga with the matches, let it flame up!

Guaranteed to bring the flames, got that fire
When you're listening, yes that-that fire, fire
You don't like me, so what? act up, fire goin' make ya hate me
Fuck sick shit up, move up, burn shit down, spark it up!
Then ya lay down.. cause I got that fire, fire, fire baby!

Now for quite some time
And she been naggin' a nigga
The whole damn ride
When I first met the girl
Everything was all good
She grew up around my way
So hey, the love was all hood
So I figured it was cool
And we could do this
And, plus she had a booty
That was sicker than lupus
I had to scoop it
Anyway, we started hangin' out
And talkin' on the phone mo'
And before you know
We on her floor doin' the Grown Folk
Everything was cool, y'all
We had it plain and simple
She wasn't my broad, and I wasn't her man
More like ""homie-lover-friends""
She said she understand
But I can't tell she comprehend
'Cause she keyin' on my Benz
While I'm sleepin', she be creepin' on me
Sneakin' in my pockets
Lookin' for numbers in my phone
And condoms in my wallet
Then she overdid it
This bitch pointed a pistol at me
Talkin' about ""We need to talk""
'Cause she ain't happy
So shit....

To be so skinny, baby girl had a nice round ass
I used to stay two steps behind her while I walked her to class
Back in school, a nigga's mission was to fuck 'em and flee
But I was young, so I let her get close to me
And I was kinda in love
Everyday a nigga wit' her
After school a nigga wit' her
At the mall takin' pictures
All the while I got my niggaz sayin' I'm breakin up the group
I'm out here missin' my rehearsals
'Cause I'm tryin' to knock boots
She ain't even let me hit it
Got me talkin' about commitment
Got me climbin' through the window
Won't even let me get it

Bailin', breathin' Hell's air

Why did I have to kill that man? I should've never let my anger build
Now my state of awareness keeps me wishin' I was thinkin'
Should have reason I didn't really mean to stop the boy from breathin'

Cause I heard some nigga screamin', gettin' raped last night
I did the crime, but I wasn't thinkin' about me doin' the time

Trapped in these closed walls ain't had no conversation 
With my family on the outside cause they won't except my phone calls
After a couple of years of sheddin' tears, my heart is stone hard
Believe I'm ready for war and on guard

I've been shot, grew up without my pops
In the hood round block seen niggaz shot
Got rid of them thangs, tryin' to chase them knots
Cause I had to have it, knew niggaz that's lookin' for where my stash at
Watchin' my back, puttin' up ready for niggaz that wanna check that
And I can't keep it kind, if you puttin' in work 
And your dreams is just like mine
Wake up in cold sweats, regrets about what I thought was lies
I can see me not doin' that
But I did it, we live it, the hood shows you no slack
And believe it, there's no, no-no, comin' back

Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Bow Wow!)
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (Give her a little bit)

Weezy, girl, I can't believe what you sayin'
You know you got it; should meet with my fans
But every time I get a break I'm layin'
Where? In your arms all night and day playin'
You want some time, I send you Jacob
Want sunshine, then take a vacation
We ain't gon' make it if you keep complainin', everybody go through changes
Love is a (Dangerous) thing
It's full of happy and sad faces, break it up to make up later
Talk it out so it ain't no anger
We need more communication, you should have some consideration
Cause you knew from the day we met, what, what type of player you was dealing wit', ha ha

Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Wish!)
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit a (Give her a little bit)

Everything I do, just for me and you
Stack a little paper so it's never rainy days
I got you, but just for me, then you got to understand that I hustle, hustle
Diamonds, things, I gotta hustle, hustle; anything that brings the weight up
See, a real thug too - it's in his nature, it's in his nature
Not tryin' to say that you about that paper, but me and you, yes we like that paper
Overseas trips, diamonds on the wrists; you must admit: your boy gets that paper
I like bossin', girl, girl, but you beside me, slide wit' me, slide wit' me
Try and take it away; that's when I ride and ride

Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E
Boy, if ya wanna make it
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of love! (Is that what ya tellin' me?)

[Akon]
Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same
There's a lot a haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me

[Krayzie Bone]
When I'm dead and gone they're gonna remember me as bein one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors when they gain terror inside
I pop in their mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
My lyrics were potent, my fight was venom
I could kill 'em, when I get in them
Niggas never knew what'd hit em
Legends
For what we done did on these streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessin'
We take em and put em on beats
n we give em back no question
Grandaddy of th mid-west
Crazy Jackson
The lyrical serial killer
I fell 'em, the innocent is askin' about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster than half of these niggas rappin'
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin'
No time for second chances
When it all goes down and they put me in my grave
""Fuck em all"" across my tombstone and bury me with my game

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
My reputation is solid gold
And my street cred is all polished y'all
Known as th little boss hog in the hood
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar
Niggas in th past try t hold a nigga down
But I put in my work and checked it checked it
Now these niggas respect it
Knowin I'm th wrong one they wanna mess with
From the gutter
With my brothers
Knowin on these ghetto streets they don't love us
Duckin' these undercovers
These muthafuckers doin everythin to try n bust us
But these suckas, know they cant touch us
They envy deep in they hearts
Nigga if they ever try to rush
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart
Niggas go hard, from the start
Nigga this heart is my bodyguard
Fuck with mine and I'll charge
Little crazy-ass nigga at large
Pullin cars, on these lanes
Nigga I never let go of my heat
Stand up man on his feet
Little Lazyie Bone on this beat nigga

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
What I got to do for you not to forget who bought you with that straight thug spin
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk with that harmony all over it hey!
Bones sing, 'n mixed in with that street talk
'N then the lazy get their creep on
'N he went home, but its all good
He left the right ones an hes still in th hood
Rest in peace, like him when I die I hope they remember me
Thats why I know I gotta reach you with these beats
Its not for nothin remember the thugs for the songs that we sung
N makin it through that struggle, that struggle
It aint easy believe me, we bleedin believe it
Still goin with that hustle, gettin stronger so they remember me

It does not belong to man who must walk even to direct his step
Correct me oh Jehovah however with judgment not in anger

Why am I payin' this price for fame now with the shame
I'm goin' blame cause I'm solo empty
When I can stop and give it all to Christ
Cause in his name no weapon should be formed against me
Simply know that the world gon' tempt me Satan is the enemy

I don't want to live my life tryin' to be rebellious

A lot of soldiers in the pin ain't ever comin' home
Can you find it in your heart to pray
So it seems everything goin' wrong
And you're just tryin' to find your way

Tryin' to keep a safe place to stay
Don't stress it's a test God Bless all ya
Really gotta do is just keep your faith

[Wish Bone]
You can feel it if you open up, you can get it if you need love
As much as a mustard seed is all you need
Small price to pay for the air that we breathe
And the baby is born, place to go when we leave
Food that we eat, weapon when we sleep
It's a miracle no believin' the Lord

Hey!
What cha seein' on the news has already been written in the Bible
But ain't nobody takin' the time to realize that believin' and readin'

So when Armageddon really come true what chu gon' do?

You know God is great and everyday I wake

Nobody thought he make it up outta the hood, before the gun blast (Gun blast)
'Cause Johnny wanted to be a thug
Runnin' from cops out on the block, the boy was hot and didn't give a fuck (Scandalous)
Runnin' up in the black mask, niggas if you got cash, drop it off in that bag and make craps fast
Destroyin' the system, make some money to survive the streets

And nigga never will be
Thinkin' I'm broke but I'm out here filthy, feelin' me?
Y'all niggas be killin' me
Brag about the money that you claim you makin'
Fuck around, catch your dumbass sleepin'
Then that money be up for the takin'

One day somebody shot him, and the drama got started
Now his momma's on the pipe and bigger brother's in jail
Nigga go on and cop a seat, I got a story to tell
See, first he was just chillin then his belly got hungry
Everybody in the family out for self, ain't got no money
So what's a young thug to do now? (and do now)
Ain't nothin to do but hit the streets 
And get some heat and put the rules down
That's what he get, lil' hustler off to the races
Tryin to win it while he in it, actin bad and catchin cases
Before he knew it he was in too deep
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, he was in too deep
He coulda, changed his life, but no he didn't

Every time I, turn around
Every time I, turn around
Every time I, turn around

Every time I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin' on a bad plan
Tryin' to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin' a Thugsta
At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time
There's always somebody talkin' 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin'
Hatin' on a mission, fakin' on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Every time that I turn around
Somebody all up in my business
Actin' like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'm a put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him
Every time I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin' niggas was weak but we showed 'em
We on top it ain't no stoppin' us, the suckas wishin' we would go away
so they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray

Every time I turn around somebody doin' somethin' foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin' to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize, but the clock
is sayin' time don't wait for nothin', it don't stop
Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat
Yeah nigga all that, we livin' in a cruel world
It's rough in the ghetto but we put family first
When friends turn to foes and the enemy's exposed
That's when you gotta move on and kick dirt
My wife and my seeds dependin' on me
to make it home safe with them groceries
How it's 'posed to be, they ain't close to me
Yeah I'm in association but I'm playin for my own team
Too much division, head-on collisions
is blockin' my visionary skills
Get back to the mission to pay my own bills
Stay on point and I guard my own grills
Skills I'm possessin', in my possession
Why they wanna rob a little nigga for the blessin'?
Who is you helpin', the world or yourself?
Put it on the table cause that's the real question

I wouldn't even take it if I wasn't gon' listen
But look here, this here, some of y'all garbage
I know you didn't feel it when a nigga didn't call ya
Keep your CD, save your money, it's hard to make a dollar
You wastin' your time, swallow your pride, be smart
You good to take advice? Alright, nigga get a job
And a message to the niggas tryin' to sue me
You make me hate the spotlight
Cause I really wanna do you
Lazy-ass bums, in-the-cut cowards
Back door pussies stretchin' them undeserved dollars
I know you want a taste, I'm a bring it to your face
Bring it to your face, say it to your face
I hear your little chatter sayin that the Bone done
Smilin' in my presence hatin' on that Thug love
But Bone got a category, fan base thug love
Hit the avenues, never done, let 'em know it
Y'all niggas chump change, chase fame, earn mine
Within the right to take mine
Take it to the top with a dream from the block
Didn't believe, now they got they hands out
Make me feel bad with the weight on my shoulders

Come with the drama, nothin' can break us

Every time I turn around

The cops harassin', shakin' me down on parole
and put a nigga through the whole damn spiel
This kid lookin' polished
No wonder I got a rap sheet way more enough to fill an album
Stack keep it full throttle
They lookin' for the heat, that's why they got 'em, C-L-E my motto
Within the Lord I'll abide
Example of a good role model I'm tryin' to provide
But every time they pull me over, it's like I'm back on trial
They tryin' to catch a thug dirty while I'm ridin'
You see a nigga fully rehabilitated
Back reunited with my fam, still we are the greatest
Broke up then we woke up (woke up)
Spoke up, niggas got it together and made up (made up)
Now we got 'em jumpin' back on the bandwagon
When we gon' drop? That's all they keep askin'
When we do this shit we'll hit the fan
Every sucka that hated on they gon' get a thrashin' now
Every time I turn around 
these biters tryin' to take our sound
But yo it ain't nothin' that can fade our style, my style

Every time that I turn around
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier
Every time that I turn around
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier

Every time I turn around gotta listen to the sound
of the negative crawlin' all over the ground
Like look what you did, let me enter in your kiss
Nigga save me, suck my what? I'll kill your babies nigga
So the wicked was the corner place, dweller place
Never gon' eat that, eat that
Satan the original serpent on his last track
Flat broke, dead on his back, crawlin' on his belly
Lookin' for his celly, I can call the telly

Next my ass, I know you bitch
You gets no ass, goin down like Nelly

Don't pretend I'll bust first 
Cause that's if they do fear and now you wanna argue
Getting back would be my new career retire on that ass,

Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives
So I'm a be comin', be ready for the next shine
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell

I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down

We hit the road back in 1993
Had a vision like a prophet, the project was go see
The logic was so deep, I come back and do a lotta good
I heard the callin' so I headed out to Hollywood
One-way tickets, my niggas and no fear
Some said that we was trippin', the mission was so clear
Don't wanna go there, the money was over there
I still love ya 9-9, I miss ya St. Clair
Yeah, now I'm movin' on a roller coaster
Just ridin', tryin' to be Jehovah's soldier
And I'm grindin', tryin' to make it better for ya
So for now I best be gone, be gone
I made a vow to change the world somehow
I'm a impact it and see it in this lifetime
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine
But for now I'm gone - I gotta go get it

[Chorus]

If it's out there to get, then I'm a go and get it
Get it 'til I got nothin' left, chasin' better livin'
It's a 'tinuous mission, so I'm steady movin'
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losin'
I'm a Thug true, add to or get out the way
You could settle for less, but I need more on my plate
Eatin' good, family good
Okay 'til that day I'm a get up and move, move
Show my babies how the Thug do, ooh
I'm a play it like it's my last game
If it's due better give it up right away
Cause a thug nigga's gonna bring pressure
See me fucked up, starvin' nigga, never
And as long as niggas out here gettin' paid
Back to my old ways, who they gonna run and tell, huh?
It's a street thang, c'mon

[Chorus]

Yeah we ready, back up in 'em with nothin' but the harmony rhythm
Hard hittin' flows all we give 'em
Flows that spit venom, no cop, there goes the end of 'em
Ever since the beginnin' we winnin' it
Get a glimpse of legends standin' on deck
'Til we come we'll be here holdin down the set
Keep on wonderin' what the Bone 'bout to do next
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless
The fan fam' flex all across the U.S.
Overseas and Tel Aviv and back west
You know we go the hardest, no need to say we better than the rest
It's obvious more or less
Came down off my high from the wet
When I had to do a stretch, I signed so I cashed the check
Had me caught up in a game, insane, my head blown
What's goin' on cause ain't nobody home

Like I'm in trouble, pressured by the devil.

Wish that I could hug You.

And I'm tryin' to keep from going under.

Each time I try, they lie, no lie! 
Judgin' from the outside lookin' in.
Never had a clue of what Id really do. 
The ghetto pushin' through, but I'm a do it right.
Never buckle, never stop to struggle!
Layzie gotta muscle through the pressure, 
Bust pipes, my life, highlights, 
Bright lights, all right! Story of a warrior. 
My flight, final destination, thug motivation, 
Time never wastin', pacin' my stride.

Tryin' to get it good! Feel the hustle and flow.
You know we are them mighty soldiers.
Had it been for all the shit we been through 
And doin' whatever but God surely knows.
So here we are steady on the go. 
Its too late cause we been through crazy.
Everyday seem to bring a twist 
That take us on a loop but we don't let it phase.
Raisin these babies through it.
 We never run away from responsibility, but where you goin'?
Youre gonna have to face the music anyway. 
Livin' through a true reality but you be blowin'!.

Let off some aggression and yo the flesh 
Will really give em something to stress, 
More likely even less.

Lil' nigga bailin' through the hood, 
Livin' crooked like I could.
Get cha for your goods! Make it understood! Put it on the wood!
Nigga what! (what!) I used to have to grind in the dough.
Did a little time in the poke.
A couple wicked rhymes 
That I wrote really helped a nigga shine with my folks.
Cause, nigga, I was broke. 
Eazy heard us go. And Eazy said,
Whoa, yall niggas dope! 
Five niggas loc, five killer flows, y'all finna blow!
So temptation made us sign the papers overnight sensation!
Clearly chasing satan. 
Niggas really famous.
Got a lot of haters, calling us the greatest, 
Number one and can't nobody fade us!
Got that top spot (done did it, done did it) 
And then came back fallin' down. (down)

I don't know what happened? 
What happened? Why did Eazy die?
Whats wrong with Bizzy? He alright! 
Is Flesh really comin' home? Is Bizzy comin' home?
Just wish he'd come and take Henny the dome! 
I'm so high, stay faded. (faded)
Might feel a little better but the pain stays there. 
Its OK, the real gotta spike.
Everywhere we go, the hood ?
They can relate to the fight, the real from the fake.
Sound good hes alive.

[Chorus]

As I wake up early in the morning. 
Light my cigarette and wake up all my bitches.
Take a shower, quickly tell The Lord I love Him! 
Didn't invite the devil cause I gave him ? evil.
I never ever thought I'd keep my candles-lit up, 
Get em' hit em' get em' ? Bizzy!
Nobody know my struggle nor my hustle. 
I'm a certified rider! Gave up all my children.
Women in my shit and dipping, 
Now you know the Lord is always with me that's my only weapon.
Talk to every sinner Bless em'. 
Then I raise my seven ? and I don't give a fuck either! 
Television celebratin Livin ? 
Every now and then I'm chillin'.
Nigga this is my life and I'm a live it 
And give it right back to God.

This how we do it

[Chorus: x2]
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me

Now that I'm dead and gone I finally got these niggas up out of my business
Death has severed all my friendships, it's been hell ever since I've been here
All these fake niggas come to my funeral, look at them sheddin' they dry tears
Look at my baby mamas and them trippin' out, actin' a fool front of my kids
Then I got niggas puttin' drug paraphernalia in my casket
A spliff, a picture of me still livin and a bullet from a Magnum
Man I feel bad for my family, but in death it's a safer place
than bein' amongst these chumps and scavengers, then one of my niggas say
He said, ""I'll see you in the afterlife"" (in the afterlife)
Don't he know that it's only G-O after life? My nigga been learned wrong
I don't plan on goin' to heaven, I'm tryin' to get ready for the resurrection
But until then I'm patiently restin', think of my sins, no need on me stressin'

[Chorus]

See now that I'm gone and I'm dead 
And I'm buried in life in a hurry like why did I run with straps?
I made it, tell Fe-Fe don't worry, I scrambled and scurried but only my lungs collapse
Surely I'll make you a song for that, how could I really go wrong with that?
Sayin' that smokin' was killin' my vocals, not sayin' that Layzie put on for rap
Known for rap and soldier'd up, can't none of y'all say that I owed y'all nothin'
When I fade to black just hold it up, y'all better say that I made y'all somethin'
When the shells collapse and the soul relax, lookin' down at yo' body (Wally)
Walk through the tunnel went into the bright light, hopin' he did right by somebody
I mean, I ran with the right team, did my dirt had fun in the night life
It wasn't a pipe dream, my legacy tellin' me I live Christ-like
I hear what they sayin' but fuck all the weepin', I peep it just keep it, I live mine
Celebrate them good times, just read the will, Stevie, Stevon

[Chorus]

Life dealt me a raw deal, had to make it for what it was worth so went on to sick-ville
Just what have I done? Signed in my balance then had to get strong when I took the deal
Strugglin' and strivin', farther my purpose to toil harder
Tryin' to make good off my honor 'til a hater really make me a martyr
Kiss my, gonna miss my daughters, hope I taught my seeds proper
I love my mother and father equal but I did damage to so many people
So much evil it's hard to see through the dark, gotta fight fire with fire
Let it spark and light up my way, they said he went out in a blaze
My enemies steady hatin' waitin' for me to take my last breath
No longer Flesh, had peace and yet the rest consume and avenge my death
Served my stretch, did my best then it's back to the Lord who made me
All the rest of y'all can judge but it's only up to God to save me

Gotta put ya mind to it
Put ya feet in the dirt

Soundtrack of my life

Alright, I admit we done did some crazy shit
But I stop, repent
Kept God in my sights

No doubt about it
You bound to feel it good
We still hood, even though we came up
Changed the whole game up
No matter how much they angry steady saying we ain't the same.
Pointing the blame at us
The only thing is Imma go get it even if I gotta split your wig
They can't get enough of my style cause I got the job well done winning it (winnin' it)
Big up's to all of my hustlers
While the globe spinnin', it ain't time to sleep
Break me off a piece of that paradise pie
'Til the day I die, Imma represent my peeps
Hit up food from all of this
Somebody sneak they piece
Nothin' but heat for the streets
Now turn up that Bone beat (beat)
They tried to hold me, but couldn't keep me down cause Flesh got a whole world of my trues to be found

[Chorus]

You owe me money, man
If not I gotta get my respect
It's too many years of grindin'
Baby mama want my royalty checks
It ain't about Twista
But nobody flippin' their tongue like Ripsta
No nigga done caused my earthquake like march
Remember that way little Capo got hurt when
My niggas is hurtin' daily
Good thing Wally see me and Krayzie
They would have just left them hailin
And there were shots in the melee
It was never to protect myself
little Layzie got em baby!
And I pop, popped everyone else
Tanks swell over the double
Me problems tends again and never left
When I see the face of Zee
Bothers me, back'n yo step!
You never could feel my wepts (remember that)
Would never have got dissed with Bone
Off to another dimension
You owe me, but I'm on my own
Now come on!

Yeah!
Still chasin' that paper, dawg
And I won't slow down 'til I done made it all
They better give me what's mine
Imma get it then go grind
Get up in it one mo' time (time)
Better ask about my rep
Better check yourself, self, self
They must've thought I was somebody else, body else
Yeah, everybody better (?) little bit of Bone Thugs
Bet they'll never own us
We originated that there, sho' nuff

Can't find your, lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star

I know the grind, she tryin' to be a star, she goin' hard
Doin' a hundred in the car but never could make it out the yard
Cause you're stalled, how, when you can't even get it started?
It's probably cause you too naughty to get up in the party
She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late night creep with him
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him
Suck him lick him, another victim of a ""bust and ditch 'em""
Why must you suffer this when really love, what's the mission?
Because you still live in your daddy and your momma house
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route
Left you with a lot of doubt, kinda like in a drought
Got no mo' integrity, slow flow, what you tellin' me?
There's jealousy goin' on, all because she wanna make it famous
And sip champagne with the greatest
So you wanna be a star, the ride you'll take is evident
You'll never get ahead so it's irrelevant (relevant)

Baby girl can sing, she thick, man I think she got it
But they tellin' me to watch her, call her baby pockets
So I bring it to her straight, to a real knight
She got herself on protection, we all good all night
She said they only wanna cut, bustas never business
Sometimes she wishes but uh, maybe then they'll listen
Dirty game, I feel the same
And do I think her career woulda jumped if she just laid down
A tear in her eye, baby don't cry
And then she told me all about her church background
And how she lovin' this life, livin' this life
Now I think I'm dealin' with a headcase
Any heart put it all in, tell yo'self it's a must-win
Apply pressure never give up, laugh in the end then fuck 'em
Stay on yo' paper nigga straight face, attitude nigga pay me
Still wanna be a star, huh, huh? Reach hard!

Hear you wanna be a star, huh?
Think you got what it take to make it large, huh?
Don't even know who you are, huh?
You say you wanted to learn it, huh? You say everybody feelin' you
""Flesh I hear 'em"" what a wonderful tinglin' feel in you
How straight are your priorities? So the story goes
Chasin' dreams, all they tellin' them is sacrifice they souls
You really listenin'? Learn a lesson from these bro's
Playin' the game it's heavy heatin' up and down that road

They say the boy got talent but he can't catch a break
He doin' everything he can but he makin' mistakes
Plus he runnin' with the crowd cause he wanna be seen
Got the tendency to follow instead of takin' the lead
We in the league of extraordinary gentlemen check
And if you wanna play the game you got to give 'em the step
Make no impression with expression but you gotta be focused
They don't pick you for the team just because you the dopest
Too many niggas got the game twisted lookin' for fame
Instead of lovin' what they do, and makin' a name
It's a shame how they idolize the idiot box
Feel the pain in television, the deception and shock
And when they finally figure out it ain't about what they seein'
Take the money and the toys, niggas still human beings
All of that ain't jack if you ain't got the respect
Cause a real superstar know how to double them checks, yep

I see women givin' they bodies like David Letterman love you
Strugglin' in the hustle, slangin' tapes on the internet avenue
Get you capitol shit, know how the ratchet do
Sorry I was late to tell you exactly what masters do
You don't have to sell your soul, no not anymore
Parker Brothers, Ouija board, I covered that Adam whore
Niggas get their labels but wait, it's a recession in weight
You downloadin' on all the industry's veterans
Been a star but bein' a star don't pay the bills
Know 'bout the spinnin' wheels, baby Bizzy keep it real
Don't open battle seals, no matter who you are
Now get your money, only Jesus can make you a star

They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high! 
They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high! 
They done gave me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high! 

I done made it up the mountain, 
Lookin' down on the valley, 
And I'm feelin' I can fly, 
So I dive off the cliff. 
Hear the little kids scream; 
They don't know I got wings. 
'Til I sprinkle them with the dreams, 
And I hit 'em with the gift. 
Say ""Bye bye"" to them haters, haters. 
No more lies ? they can't fade us, fade us! 
Why they wanna test? 
Now you rockin' with the best

We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness! 
Surely livin' in the life, it's for the thrills. 
We went up and over the hill, 
Went through the whole drill! 
Haters try to kill with kindness,

Though they won't dare cross over the line, 
For tryin', y'all know what's gonna happen, 
So they might as well remain behind us. 
Way behind! We on the hardcore grind! 
I never take my mission for granted 
Since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness. 
Better take it in stride! 
They don't wanna see us alive, 
But yet we steady creepin', reapin', weepin'. 
N-ggas went and got in way too deep in! (deep in). 
You gotta practice that before you start preachin' (preachin')

'Cause I never had more than plenty cash,

Never lookin' back! 
But the fact is that I never went nowhere! 
The truth is, me and my own ghetto got a love affair. 
(Got a love affair) 
It's so real, things we did, my conscience outta here. 
I don't care, I deserve everything I earn. 
Hell yeah I deserve some pain! 
I know I hurt! Stop talkin'! 
Night-walkin' real night stalkers, 
Zoners, hungry, heard it here first! 
Don't believe me? With wings I'll meet ya! 

Playa hater hate! 
They can hate me but they better stay away or see Krayzie loc' insane! 
So if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom, 
Way up underneath my feet. 
'Cause really I done turned a new leaf to never ever let the suckas rise, 
Or let them bustas kill the high. 
'Cause they jealous in the mind, 
They remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me, 
Pullin' me down. Bad storm for the flight, 
Keepin' me on the ground. 
Still I rise and when I takeoff they fall.

[Chorus]

And when I met Him in the sky, 
He had a body like a man and the lower body tellin' 
The Lord that he had a plan to make Him sure I wasn't evil. 
But I'm comin' with my people. 
Ain't no sequel, ain't no women, 
Ain't no vessels. 
I'ma settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage. 
I will live forever with a serpent on my head. 
Little glory, that's my man. 
I'll be damned! 
If I comin' through, I'm runnin' with my pistol. 
Weren't for Moses, 
I'ma die but I'ma come back wit' ya! 
(Wit' ya, wit' ya)
That's the way to get ya. 
Picture sinister plots! 
I'm not ""nigga with no land."" 
I imagine a strand of lightning bolts and tightened ropes. 
I'm fightin' folk with no hope. 
Earth got me loc'ed! Now chillin' in the smoke house! 
No doubt! No clout! 
Now we're goin' all out! 
Earth-ball that's all! 
Never let the devil call. 
Revelations! 
Little Biggie n-gga so long! 
Go long! Metal was so precious. 
I was resurrected! Why? 
Juniors fly to The Creator. 
And my brother be, brother be 'C'. 
Throw it up! 
Uncle 'L' comin' straight from the sky, what!

Y'all know what happened to the thief when the king catch him stealin',
Got his hands in the cookie jar.
Off with his hand!
Fuck it, off with his head!

They don't wanna see me shine!
Everybody wanna sound like Bone though come back in the Bone zone!
But you just beginnin' with the daddy you don't know.
They call me The Granddad ' Granddaddy of the Bone flow!
Well little lazy rappers, obviously we never figured this would be the lick and we'd be next to shine.
And we got everybody screamin' and singin' but these out-of-shape suckas need exercise!
So I'm-a get up in their mental.
I'm-a work 'em out over the instrumental!
Give 'em a criminal rhythm, the lyrical nympho!
Wanna see the wicked?
Better know what you're in for!
First, the fan side could be forgiven ' you didn't know!
Second time, I got up in 'em like ""here we go!""
No matter what, they sayin' we still the most realest that ever did it, feel me flow!
And everybody want a little bit against a little Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh!
A little taste so they can test and make 'em see how we the best
And I'll be realer than the rest don't flex 'cause the pump gonna get 'em.
I'm like a bullet to the chest, suffer a cardiac arrest that's so hard
And I can still get their heart and leave 'em dead and give 'em all they can get!
Send them suckas to the lyric cemetery, or the rap hospital.
Never no competition!

Come 'on, now let me take you back to The Land, you know where the heart of it all.
In 1993, when we was up out the scene.
The fellas with hell of a harmony with the flow hooked up with Eazy-E and shook up the industry and y'all just in time to get another phase.
This certainly is somethin' that you wouldn't wanna miss!
The drama when it hit the fan, we got 'em trippin' off the gift, and split a wig up with a pretty sick twist.
The Ruger like a surgeon and it's on, exactly what I cut you with is sharper than a scalpel. Actually, it's too many Bone Thug clones and they all malpractice, arrested, and send 'em to the gallows!
My trues brought a style that's unfound and you can feel it naturally.
But we ain't no magicians.
Really ain't no thing to make a fraud disappear.
Steady givin' what they love to hear, make 'em listen up close.
Everybody know we got the dough.
We choppin' nothin' but missiles, still the nigga who the greatest!
Y'all lost!
Can't even afford the cost, this is authentic and nothin' that's dealin' with them world-wide bosses!
We got the sauce, baby, we got the juice!
We keep 'em in a frenzy fiendin' for more!
On the ThugLine with F.B.G., 7th Sign, and Mo' Thug once again we about to blow!
We about to blow! Set it off, explode!
Set it off, explode!

I'm-a treat it like a race and I gotta win it!
Ahead of you bums with the Bone flow, thug invented.
Haters wanna wonder why them thug niggas still gettin' in.
Nothin' changed the game like we did so we here, still with it.
Gotta tell the truth.
We changed things.
Bringin' somethin' new that's everlasting.
I'm-a keep it real.
It's next to nothin'!
Doin' the same thing 'cause less creating.
Flow just borin', the spit just corny.
What happened to old bitin' 'self?
Writin' battles done face to face.
I miss those days.
These days, ghost writers, fake artists with nothin' to say.
I'm-a give it Wish due my street dues.
Just stay cool.
I know I got you when I need to pop you'll let loose.
And you don't wanna see a thugsta hit with a Grey Goose.
Or we could buy the bar, just stay cool and we good.
Recognize we thug, could of been all hood.
The flow's all love, thugs could of been all hood.
Pick up on it, never fully get it - this Bone flow!
Smilin', hatin' but you'll see me on the low! (low)
In the game with the number one!
Straight from the Cleveland slums.
Straight off the block, never hustle to the floor though.
Kickin' 'em down how them Bone Thugs came through.
Yeah, yeah.
We took it to another level (level), level (level), level (level)

As soon as I'm receivin' the call, now give me the ball, I run with the dogs, then keep the b'all. Now meet me at the mall, you can check on every shelf on the wall, they makin' money off the Bone Thugs!
Equipped with a saw, with a knife in my back.
Everybody rappin' fast, but the harmony ain't in it, and now that's too much to pass.
Now that's too much to ask when you pick up a crash course style to change-up, come on! (I swear!) My trigger-finger's itchy, but my carpel tunnel was gone it was written and rippin' problems like water flowin' in humbles.
I'm workin' with seven shovels, the grave-diggers and others!
Nobody understand The Man.
Clones, now shut-up!
I'm quicker than a boogey-wicked-monster, never just like the movie.
We know when we pray to God.
Keep goin' we get the hustle on in the Spring, Fall!
In Summers and the Winter months, we gonna praise Jesus!
Don't even represent us, like we ain't said nothin'!
Present the flow then grown know where we come from.
Sun come shine in, Equinox rhymin', Layzie (Layzie!) perfect timin', grab my gun! (gun, gun)

And I don't give a fuck if I was 86'd
A muthafucka play me like I'm Canibus
Im ready for the battle like a Pagan is
Im never gonna take it in and nobody can break it in
As-salamu alaykum for the bacon
And a little bit of coke I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it we selling
Every rock that they can smoke so let's take a toke and Imma rake it in
Pillsbury the dough, to the dome, like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go
Straight to the dro
Creepin' on em, peeping on em, leave em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on em, keeping on em, taking every foe
For the love of the money B gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know
For the ending of the row gotta go will I go
When I get it Imma know to follow my known foe
My caliber lock and load alabaster box when I cock and I crow
Gotta Glock and I'm Bone Thug where you wanna flow
To the clock and the time zone
Spirit gon fly all y'all niggas dead to the life force cyclones
Right now when they hydro while what about the well known Cairo

Got em stuck in the grave
Im on the grind full time never rest to get paid
A little hustlin' muthafucka put the brush to the face
I Cut the braids, hit the stage now they looking amazed
I went from cookin the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
Gotta bookin' today and ima split it with my bros
Gotta get it how we go come meet me with the pros
Now I'm never gonna fold, watch the bank account grow
If it ain't about dough then it ain't about jack
And I'ma take it like i want it i ain't giving it back
I get us in with a stack and then i get on attack
Im like the tasmanian devil nigga bigger than Shaq
Call the reaper get the shovel I'm a certified rebel in a league of my own
And that’s a whole nother level, nothing's free
I never settle keep the pedal to the metal
When them haters in my rear view, hello hello

Burn, baby let it burn
Now it’s my turn
I get in a nigga's system like a hundred viles of sherm
Then I kill em with 2 thousand words in 2 minutes
You never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
Yeah, you heard em try to get with it
But couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
Man they think they can deal with this
And knock me out my rhythm, but I’m never gonna be the fuckin' victim
'Cause I’d rather be the suspect
Haven’t I given them enough yet
Can’t they understand they ain’t dealing with a punk bitch
One quick move and it’s murder
And I’m a serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
A$AP, but wait a minute
I’m probably one of the sickest niggas that ever did it
I’m in it cause I’m a win it
I’m a muthufuckin' lyrical tyrant
Pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more, just twist the words
You better listen and observe, how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me, but my shits superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once before he hit the curb
So get at me, I’m kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift
I’m like a 44 magnum, Stag one
Backin' em up, body bag full of niggas
Wack raps, that’s wack, so I’m stackin' em up
Kray Jack in the cut, still got a little bit of murda for em
Murderous poet, I create a bloody murda poem
So when they run up on me nigga be ready to show em
Redrum redrum redrum rum rum

Yo, before this project
We’d like to thank the most high
On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and, all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure its a hand)
With all things around me I will never win
I won’t win with angels
I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome
I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt

At least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)
Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

Die, die we all pass away

Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Yeah! That's nice
Yeah!

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray

No smoke pours from my chimney
'Cause all my fire has been spoken for

Nobody comes a knocking
There's no food to eat my cupboards bare
House full of nothing
What you left me when you left me here

I know that lonely's a waste of time
It's got me hurtin' deep down inside
But I don't have the will to change my state of mind

I've talked to friends who say they understand
But there's no sympathy for a lonely man

What am I to do?
Left me all alone and I'm feeling like a fool ya'll
What am I to do?

Thought that we would be forever
Then I wake up and it's all gone
What am I to do?
Except be blue

Now days most conversations bore me
And too much is not enough to drink
My friends, all most forgotten
Have stayed away to give me time to think

About my shiny future
Alone to live the life of luxury
In my house full of nothing 'cause
Nothing's what you left of me

I need somebody to ease my mind
Turn to the bottle to help me understand
There's no salvation for a drunken man

What am I to do?
Left me all alone and I'm feeling like a fool ya'll
What am I to do?

Thought that we would be forever
Then I wake up and it's all gone
What am I to do?
Except be blue

Took my car, my dancin' shoes, even took my attitude
Stripped the sheets from the bed
Stole the grease right off my head
Won't somebody please ease my mind

To animals and criminals alike
Hood, project, trailer park, Backwoods
Sprinkles of the cocaine in his nails
Tank full of propane on the shelf
Fire's in the soul, the child is now a man
The enemies of good now become a friend
Watchin' God play his life violin
Happily, an instrumental in the wind
You will never fit, you're a misfit
You're a quiet voice no matter how loud you get
Despite the effort, you remain reckless
You remain helpless in the same outfit
As your father did before, you're a song
Better sing the praises of the written wrongs
Only time will kill your spirit if you let it fall
And that's why there's

No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else

The rifle's in the corner, money on the table
Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle
Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him
Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor
And takes another toke, smoke fills the room
Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom
Cops on the run, sirens in the distance
Wild small town, violent and resistant
In the street, they rage and fight
Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin'
Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war
Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings
Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals
Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em
Steel with the trigger finger, take your life
Billy in the basement, wasted, makin' pipe
Bombs take it light, wrong take it real
Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal
Take the front, son, run for the hills
Cowards under power make sonic seals
Cast a shadow over underprivileged minds
While they're chasin' money, hit some basic rhymes
If the world gives you pen and paper, draw the line
Because there's no time

There's no time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else

No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else",True to Yourself,2017
Boney James,"Last night I fell asleep all alone
Tossing and turning
Waiting for you to come home
As you walked through that door
I felt it even more
It showed all over your face

For the very first time
I know that I realized my world is not the same
Now that your gone   
You're gone
If I've done something wrong
I'd take it back
I just can't stand to see you go 
I don't understand just where we went wrong
What happened to our happy home

What am I doing here
Wearing your favorite dress
I've tried everything
But you just don't seem to care
How could it be
I prayed my feelings were wrong
I just can't believe it
You'd leave me here all alone

For the very first time

",Happy Home,1993
Boney James,"I keep going over it and over it again in my mind
I get these flashbacks and I feel so good
This is one night that I'll never forget
You see, it was just like in the movies
I mean, it actually happened just like this...

The stars were shining brighter than most of the time
Then love came out of nowhere

No thrill will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night
(The night when I fell in love)
The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you

I've known so many people, been to most parts of the world
And seen some things that have blown my mind, but...

I thought I would be happy without any love in my world
But now I know that , that is so untrue

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand

No wedding Saturday within the month of June

Was born on Christmas day
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's Boy Child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A King was born today
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Mary's Boy Child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music seemed to come from a-far

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A King was born today
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
""Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace""

And then they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little Boy was born

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A King was born today
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted

You sent your Son to save us
Oh my Lord
Your very self you gave us

That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

When in the crib they found Him
Oh my Lord
A golden halo crowned Him
Oh my Lord
They gathered all around Him
To see Him and adore

This day will live forever
Oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
They had become to doubt you
Oh my Lord
He is the truth forever

What did they know about you?
Oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
But they were lost without you
They needed you so bad
His light is shining on us

Oh my Lord, oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
With the Child's adoration
Oh my Lord oh my Lord
He is a personation
There came great jubilation
Oh my Lord
So praise the Lord

Wouldn't want to be his host
Or just to meet him
And if he ever came their way
They'd be sticks and stones, I'd say
That would grieve him

He was a steppenwolf, with a forgotten past
He was a steppenwolf, who found a love at last
He was a steppenwolf

The girl he met was out-of-sight
Though she walked the streets at night
He didn't mind it
She seemed as happy as a song
And if anything was wrong
He didn't find it

They used to laugh and dance and drink
And not ever did he think of a payday
No matter where they ever were
Every day he spent with her was a hey-day

He was a steppenwolf, and not a handsome man
He was a steppenwolf, who didn't know her plan
He was a steppenwolf, not very bright at all
He was a steppenwolf, just riding for a fall
He was a steppenwolf

One day she said ""it's time you knew
That I started up with you
For just one reason
You're gonna do just what I want
'cause there's something that I want
And I ain't teasing
My life is empty all around
Nothing that I ever found
Would fulfill me
So for a while I'll be with you
When I say that we're through
You must kill me!""

He was a steppenwolf, he cried ""it isn't fair""
He was a steppenwolf, ""you know how much I care""
He was a steppenwolf, she said ""this is the deal""

 I was through with you
 Splitting up forever
 Seemed the thing to do
 I said I can't stand you
 With your honey touch
 This time you were cheating me
 One time too much
 Just then I remembered
 That a friend I knew
 Told me one thing
 I should never do
 Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night
 Everything may look so different in the early morning light
 Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark
 What you're getting into may be just a lark
 Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high
 Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why
 Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance
 And don't fall for someone else's song and dance

 Right next to me
 Mine just for the asking
 He said he would be
 But to leave my man
 Seemed to me all too strange
 And I'd say that I'm glad
 I didn't make the change
 Now our life is almost
 Like a Paradise
 Let me pass on to you
 This advice
 Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night
 You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right
 But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool
 When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool
 Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell
 Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well
 Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight

Boney M.,"He was black and handsome
And mighty mighty brave
Comin' from the backwoods
The grandson of a slave
He was caught for something
They knew he'd never done
And he was diggin' ditches
Out in the burnin' sun

No more, no more, no more

Man he was a giant
And iron he could bend
And he swore he'd fight them
Down to the bitter end
Though he was no talker
His burnin' eyes would say
You may keep on tryin'
Can't hold me no way

[Chorus]

And one night he lay in waiting
Hit the guard and took the key
And before the others caught him
He jumped out and he was free
He jumped out and he was free

He made for the swamp lands
It seemed a hopeless duel
They had dogs and shotguns
And they were mighty cruel
But they couldn't find him
He was too smart and strong
Hiding' in the daytime
Wandering all night long

She bathed his wounds
And he kissed her trembling fingers

To the thrub of flamingo guitars
Seemed a long long way from tomorrow's fight

And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn

And everyone to everyone's neighbour

Boney M.,"This is the story of El Lute
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal
Because he was poor
But he refused to accept his fate
And today his honor has been restored

He was only nineteen
And was sentenced to die
For something that somebody else did
And blamed on El Lute
Then they changed it to life
And so he could escape
From then only chased him
And searched for him day and night
All over Spain
But the search was in vain
For El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life
The man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home
Just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
Though he taught himself
To read and to write
It didn't help El Lute
He was one who had dared to escape overnight
They had to find
El Lute

Soon the fame of his tale
Spread like wild fire
All over the land
Were the prize on his head
People still gave him bread
And they gave him a hand
For they knew he was right
And his fight was their fight

No one gave you a chance
In the Spain of those days
On was every place
They had put up the face of El Lute
And he robbed where he could
Just like once Robin Hood
They finally caught him
And that seemed the end
But they caught him in vain
'Cause a change came for Spain
And El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life
The man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home
Just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
And then freedom really came to his land
And also to El Lute
Now he walks in the line
Of a sunny new day

Than prison for living in peace

A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal
Because he was poor
But he refused to accept his fate

And today his honor has been restored
He was only nineteen
And he was sentenced to die
For something that somebody else did

And blamed on el lute
Then they changed it to life
And so he could escape
From then on they chased him

And searched for him day and night
All over spain
But the search was in vain for el lute
He had only seen the dark side of life

The man they called el lute
And he wanted a home just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
So he taught himself to read and to write

It didn't help el lute
He was one who had dared to escape overnight
They had to find el lute
Soon the fame of his name

Spread like wild fire all over the land
With a price on his head
People still gave him bread
And they gave him a hand

For they knew he was right
And his fight was their fight
No one gave you a chance
In the spain of those days

On the walls every place they had put up
The face of el lute
And he robbed where he could just like once robin hood
They finally caught him and

That seemed the end
But they caught him in vain
Cause a change came for spain
And el lute

He had only seen the dark side of life
The man they called el lute
And he wanted a home just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free

And then freedom really came to his land
And also to el lute

And for all eternity

He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Ra ra rasputin
Lover of the russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the russian land and never mind the czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

Ra ra rasputin
Lover of the russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
For power became known to more and more people,
The demands to do something about this outrageous
Man became louder and louder.

""this man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged ""don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""come to visit us"" they kept demanding
And he really came

Ra ra rasputin
Lover of the russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said ""I feel fine""

Ra ra rasputin
Lover of the russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead

Wenn er will, ja, dann soll er mich holen

Jeden Tag wieder Sex und kein Schloss, das mich hindert
Such mir keinen Job, weil ich Bock auf Gewinn hab
Bock auf Champagner, nichts integrieren
Rockstar Allemannia, fick nicht mit mir
Ob Vodka im Glas, oder Joggen im Park
Der Gazi steht auf und hat Bock auf den Tag

Bonez MC,"Wir sind eine Familie Digga, verstehst du?
Da geht's um Essen und um alles Digga, verstehst du?
Da geht's um wo ich penn und so, verstehst du was ich meine?
Das ist 187!

Erst wenn das letzte Pape gerollt ist, pack ich hier ein
Ich wollte den Scheiß also soll's jetzt so sein
Verfolgst dus allein? Nein!
Meine Beute wird geteilt, der Erfolg bringt den Neid
Therapeuten suchen Streit, sagen du bist Soziopath
Doch der Hurensohn von Staat kriegt 'ne Kugel in seinen Arsch
Ich blute für mein Schnapp, ich hafte für die Gang
Verteidige die Fam, es macht alles einen Sinn
Reingehen, rauskommen, Feinde ausknocken
Hatte mir was vorgenommen, doch hab schon wieder Post bekommen
Du Fotzensohn, fick deine Mama jetzt
Jeder weiß du petzt, wenn du in der Scheiße steckst
Hab keinen Respekt vor Ratten die das Schiff verlassen (Schiff verlassen)
Bring sie ran und ich fick die Spasten (fick die Spasten)
187 wir sind Hits am machen (Hits am machen)
Und darauf kannst du dich verlassen (dich verlassen)

Erst wenn das letzte Pape gerollt ist, dann pack ein
Nur wenn das beste Haze im Joint, dann werd ich high
Ich mach's nochmal deutlich, meine Mannschaft die geilste
Niemals alleine, Angst hab ich keine

Niemals alleine, Angst hab ich keine

Seit 2012 Digga drei Mal auf Tour
Ich bleib in der Spur, es ist Zeit für 'ne Uhr
Weiterhin stur, das ist meine Natur
Rein in die Bufo, schick Feinde auf Kur
Meine Masche zu krass, hab 'ne Maske im Sack
Bis die Kasse bei mir platzt lass ich's krachen in der Nacht, was?
Leb nach meinen Regeln, fick diesen Staat
Und bis Scheine regnen dreht der Nigga richtig am Rad
Mit den Flittchen im Park wird der Rahmen gesprengt
High sein vor Eiweis, der Hase am brennen
187 Ich mache mich grade für die Gang
Fahre keinen Benz aber hab tausende von Fans
Shisha mit Eisschlauch, Fifa und ein' bauen
High rauchen, mit Lilanen einkaufen
So geil aussehen, dass die Weiber heiß laufen
Mein scheiß Outfit kostet circa eintausend

Erst wenn das letzte Pape gerollt ist, dann pack ein

„Hasuna was machst du da?
Hast du Gras? Warst du Knast?“
Sie will Foto, ich mach Schnapp
Zur Belohnung gibts meinen Schwanz
Mach mich grade für die Gang
Die Schaft unter'm Hemd werd' dein Arm brechen, Nasen
Deine Barbie geht dir fremd
Durch meinen Gaunergang mach ich dir V-Mann Angst
Meine Laune schwankt, geh auf Distanz
Meid den Blickkontakt, sonst ist gleich Schicht im Schacht
Mitternacht in der Stadt, Schicksalsschlag, Gitterstab

Handy klackt, Text verkackt, Polizei hängt am Sack
Meine Schlampe lenkt nicht ab, 3 Uhr nachts dein Fenster kracht
Gangster machen schnapp schnapp, du bist ein Verlierer
Tu nicht so auf Dealer, deine Schuhe sind von Fila
Wir leben auf einem Planeten voll Affen
Bewegen die Massen, die Mädels angaffen
Geschäfte laufen, Hunde verkaufen
Funkelnde Augen, 'ne Runde verschnaufen
Ja wenn du das suckst, dann weiter so machst, dann
Dann rappe vom Benz, man, fahre mit Mazda
Egal ob mit Glatze oder mit Rasta, hundertmal krasser

Und fress die Kugeln von euch Schwuchteln

Du trinkst Sirp, alles glänzt so wie goldene Ketten
Du schläfst ein, Junge ich rip dein Arsch
Komm mal wir Jetten

Dikker was willst du machen, ich schnapp deine Taschen
Der Bass pumpt so krass das die Pappbecher wackeln
Und du machst dich zum Affen, 'das nicht zu fassen
Ich klatsch auf dein Nacken, hältst dich für klug
Stolperst, fällst von dem Zug
Scheiße deine ganze Crew hat nicht mal Geld für ein' Hut
Wenn ich mich locker mache brauch ich keine Vodka-Flasche
Mach bitt' ein Bomber klar, Lean in der Doppel-Tasse
Bonez immer höflich, Codein macht's möglich
Nicht so geil, weil so gesehen ist Drogen nehmen auch tödlich

Sie wollen mich knicken doch es geht nicht

Koordiniert trotz Codein, ist kein Problem was hoch zu ziehen
Paar Drogen-Deals im großen Stil, und damit die Million verdien'
Jap ich glaub dran, ab aufs Laufband, halt den Ball flach
Mach kein Aufstand, zwanzig Tags an deine Hauswand
Halt dein Maul sonst rast ich aus man, nicht mal richtig aufgestanden
Schon wollen sie ein Autogramm, Käse-Flöte auf entspannt
Verkauf ein Gramm im Hauseingang, Fotzen glotze wenn ich aus dem dreiundsechziger steige
Komm mir nicht mit Schlabberlook, dieser Anzug kostet zwei Scheine
Krokodil auf Codein, der Hase grün wie Brokkoli
Kein Bock mehr auf Kokain, digga nur noch auf dem Sofa liegen
Steh nur auf zum Drogen-Dealen, ich kann mein Geld auch so verdien'
Bin paranoid und wenn es dann klopft einfach alles das Klo runterspülen

Ey ich bin so high ich muss furzen (Furz)
Komm gib mal noch so ein kurzen
Bin krank geschrieben jeden Tag, doch ich hab nicht mal schnupfen
Häng' im Puff mit paar Nutten, die schlucken ohne zu zucken
Denn Codein ist so beliebt das die Weiber darauf durchdrehn'
Jap, das trinkt auch deine Mama, das' nicht mal 'ne kleine Straftat
Trinkt das auch der Geisterfahrer? Geld verdien' mit Scheiße labern
Lecker und gesellschaftsfähig, ich glaub sogar die Merkel trinkt
Seh' Apotheker Scheine machen, großes Zücken, kleine Flaschen
Eins acht sieben Strassenbande, Sirup in der Badewanne
Oder in der Plastikflasche, Maske auf und grabsch die Kasse
Andre' Rapper reden viel, mein Lebensstil ist kredibil
Jetzt sei doch nicht so negativ, lass uns 'ne Runde Sega spiel'n

Bonez MC,"Sie reden über große Pläne, tote Szene
Chillen immer nur bei dir wenn es grad' rennt
Hinter meinem Rücken bin ich Hurensohn
Aber reden sie von mir sind sie die größten Fans
Kein Prozent von wirklich allen meinen Lieder will deinen Respekt
Denn ich atme, lebe, ehre jede Zeile die ich rapp'
Alles echt. Hass es, lieb es, kauf es, wirf es wieder weg
Doch alle meine Bilder in deinem Kopf werden zu einer Einstellung die wächst
Schizophren, wir teilen die selbe Luft aber kommen nicht aus der selben Welt
Sprechen die selbe Sprache, doch jedes Wort von dir klingt fremd

Alle meine Werte sind was mich lenkt
Ein Blick in deine Augen sagt du bist fremd
Meine Welt ohne meine Furcht
Keine Haltung, keiner legt mir die Steine davor

Verschwendetes Glück, verbrennne, verrückt
Nur Schwachsinn egal welchen Sender du drückst
Seh' traurige Seelen, die im Internet leben
Mit Tausend Freunden die nicht hinter ihnen stehen
Das aus meinem Mund klingt schizophren
Ist ne hässliche Welt, doch ich schmink sie mir schön
Wie soll es mir schon gehen? Du weißt doch es läuft
Ich fahr' diese Schiene und bleibe mir treu
Hab erreicht was ich wollt und teil mein' Erfolg

Bonez MC,"187 Sampler einer für die Fans ja
Weiber shaken Ass (ah) weil der Beat ist Gangsta
Alle machen Lärm, plötzlich wird es ernst
Gruß an alle Kölner hinterher
M zu dem O, MC wie Bonez
Jetzt am Mikrofon, es wird riesengroß
Nimm mein Aftershave, denn jetzt wird alles rasiert
Rauchen Joints die so dick sind wie ne Latte von mir
Und es fällt mir wirklich leicht am Mikrofon
Meine Leidenschaft der Flow, live aus der Zone
Mit oder nicht fick Schlampen
Du mit deinem Hipstergesicht geh Tanzen
Rauchen Haze so grün wie das Schnapp Krokodil
Frag was macht es mit mir? Knacks im Gehirn
Geprägt von dem Scheiß, also red uns nicht rein
Erledigen live diese Szene zu zweit

Das sind Tatsachen, Hase auf die Waage packen
Ihr könnt euch selber an die Nase fassen
Weil wir uns nicht verarschen lassen
Auf der Jagd nach harten Sachen
Und auch mit Badeschlappen Party machen

Das sind Tatsachen, laber nicht von scharfen Waffen
Ihr dürft noch nichtmal diesen Hase paffen
Weil wir uns nicht verarschen lassen
Auf der Jagd nach allen Kassen
Und selbst in Badeschlappen Party machen

Trip durch die Nachbarschaft, Kampfhunde am Bellen
Digga Krampfhaft Kriminell, egal ob Hamburg oder Köln
Ich kann rappen wie ihr wollt, egal ob langsam oder schnell
Und mein Albumcover steht, ihr könnt anfangen zu bestellen
Wir genießen das Leben, lassen Features entstehen
Was für Rap-Konkurrenz? Digga niemand zu sehen
Wir lieben es eben Autos tiefer zu legen
Ihr chillt lieber in ner spießigen Gegend
Guck wir ziehn hier die Fäden, man der Untergrund brennt
Circa hunderte von Fans die meine Jungs jetzt erkennen
Bonez ich kippe den Jäger, fütter meine Köter
Hänge mit der Clique, Digga Ficker für die Hater
Trip für Verräter, keine Toleranz
Wir sind high vom Blunt, besser bleib auf Distanz
Bruder Chillout mit Momo im Benzer auf Slomo
Und niemals auf die Straße ohne Kroko, ein No-Go

Bonez MC,"Mal unter uns, in dieser Branche watest 
Du bis zum Knie in einem Sumpf von unrealistischen Wichsern

Ich leb den Scheiß schon seit Anfang
Du nicht wie ich und darum halt ich den Kreis um mich rum so klein ich kann
Nicht mehr wie früher, doch brech nie den Kontakt ab
Vier Pfoten auf der Straße und ich riech wenn du Angst hast
Komisch wie das Unkraut aus meinem Windschatten wächst
Wenn du als Freundschaft ein Schluck von deinem Trinkwasser lässt
Werden sie eklig, denn Unkraut vergeht nicht
Aber die Narben durch das Messer auf meinem Rücken halten ewig
Doch trag sie stolz wie Tattoos auf der Haut
Bau die Fans wie mich auf form' ne Mauer aus meinem Sound
Zu gierig wenn es um den Fame geht
Doch vor Gott zählt nicht mehr wie viele Platten du verkaufst
Loyalität ist das Blut in meinen Adern
Paar gute Freunde, Frau, Sohn, Vater
Alle Ratten haben das Schiff längst verlassen
Und mein drittes Auge beschützt mich im Schatten

Denn das hier ist ein Kreis mit eigenen Regeln

Meine Tochter ist ein Engel, meine Frau macht mich stolz
Was für Auto ist egal Bruder, hauptsache es rollt
20000 Volt Digga, Therapie in dein Genick
Verschwinde kurz im Zimmer und komm wieder mit nem Hit
Wir beide sind verschieden, guck die Straße hört mir zu
Sag ich mir ich bin nicht wie du und verrate meine Crew
Rapper werden schwanger und vermehren sich wie Karnickel
Rufen an und wollen mich sprechen doch ich drück sie weg wie Pickel
Kinder treffen mich am Bolzplatz, fragen mich nach Ott
Ich sag ihnen fahrt nach Holland und holt euch Hase ausm Shop
Vergiss mal das mit rappen, bitte schlags dir aus dem Kopf
Digga nicht mal was zu fressen, mein Magen ist ein Loch

Kann mein Leben nur im Zeitraffer sehen
Es zieht vorbei wie die Wolken am Himmel
Denn irgendeine Stimme sagt mir, man verliert nur Zeit, wenn man schläft
Dieser Stress macht mich alt
Wie lange soll das gutgehen, ich bin immer mit dem Vollmond allein
Die Augen schwer, doch beobachten den Feind
Dieses Leben ist ein Job und ich hab' keinen Tag frei
Ich hör' die Dunkelheit flüstern, dann die Vögel zwitschern
Und schon wieder schaltet Gott zu früh das Licht an
Ich will doch nur ein paar Stunden Schlaf
Denn ich vergesse schon die Namen und danach ihre Gesichter
Das Fell wird immer dünner, wenn das Stresslevel ansteigt
Aus reden wird anschreien
Schon wieder eine Nacht, die ich wach bleib'

Lasst mich in Frieden, ihr macht mich so müde

Nein, er lässt mich nur vergessen welche Ziele ich noch hab'
Sag mir, wozu 'ne Beziehung? Warum zieht man sich das rein?
Ganz egal, wie man es regelt, es führt immer nur zu Streit
Guck, jetzt sitzen wir am Tisch und haben uns wieder nix zu sagen

Reden, reden, labern mich zu
Nur elend, elend, aber was soll ich tun?
Brauche Schlaf, war nur wach, deshalb lasst mich in Ruhe
Lasst mich in Ruh', denn ich bin nicht so wie ihr
Bisschen introvertiert, Schwäche wird hier nicht toleriert
Hier am Block siehst du Dinge passieren
Sind schlaflos, doch rauchen, bis wir Sinne verlieren
Hellwach, wenn die Sonne untergeht
Zwischen Dreck, Mann, willkommen in unserer Gegend
S8 bringt den Untergrund zum Beben
Wenn wir kommen heißt es: „Unzurechnungsfähig“

Doch wir heben ab! Doch wir heben ab!
Doch wir heben ab! Doch wir heben ab!
Doch wir heben ab! Doch wir heben ab!
Doch wir heben ab! Doch wir heben ab!
Doch wir heben ab! 
Ja, wir sind wieder da

Die Polizei kommt, will uns kontrollieren
Das Krokodil wird kontrolliert
Hamburg, West-Wien wird kontrolliert
So viel Promille, doch kontrollieren
Wir kontrollieren, wir kontrollieren",Kontrollieren,2017
