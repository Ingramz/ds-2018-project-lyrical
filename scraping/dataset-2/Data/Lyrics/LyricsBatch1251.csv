Victor Young & His Orchestra,"Heaven, I'm in Heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to go out fishing 
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me thro' to Heaven

I'm in Heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek",Cheek to Cheek [From Top Hat],1999
Victor Young & His Orchestra,"Maybe you'll never be the love of my life,
Maybe I'm not the boy of you dreams,
But isn't it kinda fun to look in each others eyes,
Swapping romantic gleams!

Maybe you're not the girl to have and to hold,
Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay,
But isn't it kinda fun carousing around the town
Dancing the night away!

Isn't it kinda fun holding hands,
According to a sweet and corny custom.
Isn't it kinda fun makin' vows,
Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em!

Maybe we're out for laughs, a girl and a boy
Kiddin' across a table for two!
But haven't you got a hunch that this is the real McCoy,
And all the things we tell each other are true?

Oh, isn't it kinda fun holding hands,

Victor Young & His Orchestra,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999
Victor Young & His Orchestra,"Dinner is ended, the music is grand,
Softly the lanterns gleam.
Isn't it splendid to sit hand in hand,
Silently lost in a dream?

Hands across the table
While the lights are low,
Tho' you hush your lips,
Your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know.
Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly,
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me

Silence is golden, so do not reply,
And I shall understand.
All can be told in a look of your eye,
And in a touch of your hand.

Hand across the table
While the lights are low,
Tho' you hush your lips,
Your fingertips

Victor Young & His Orchestra,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon [Dodge Show],1999

Who's as strong as he can be
Eating nails and drinking Texaco
He is the type for me

There is one I California
More romantic far than you
When he sings ha cha cha chornia
I often think he'll do

But as for you sir, I'm afraid
You will never make the grade

A horse would throw you,

And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy
You have done it without a word without a touch without a sign
You have done it just by being yourself and after all perhaps that's what love means","Why Do I Love You, song (from ""Show Boat"") [From Show Boat]",2001

Remember somewhere the sun is shining

Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes

Pero cuando todo estaba oscuro
Ella llegó bajo la luz del alba.
Why con su creyón de labios
Dibujó señales en los muros,
Quiso pintar lo que sintió su alma.

why pintó why pintó por todas partes
Miles de peces de un solo color
Why llenó las calles con su graffitti de amor.

Cuando amaneció flotando
La ciudad innundada de dibujos
Nadie entendió quien se atrevió a tanto.
Unos la fueron buscando
Why otros iban borrando los muros
Why ella siguió why hasta pintó los autos.

why pintó why pintó por todas partes
Miles de peces de un solo color
Why llenó las calles con su graffitti de amor.

Por eso fue que borraron
Edificios,muros why vidrieras
Why hasta una Luna que un niño dibujó en la acera. 
Why así fue que prohibieron
Dibujar lo que sentía el alma
Para cuidar why encadenar la calma.

why como no le dejaron sitio
Donde dibujar su dolor
Se rayó su cuerpo 
Con un tatuaje de amor,
Se rayó su cuerpo
Con su tatuaje de amor.

Victoria,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door

Quand naissent les premières feuilles
D'automne,
Quand le chagrin se fait lourd,
Mes hommes,
Vont se mettre, sans un mot,
Debout autour du piano
Et me disent tendrement,
Patronne, patronne.

C'est fou comme ils sont heureux,

Quand le son du piano noir
Résonne.

 Et on reprend le voyage.

A pas de loup, ils s'esquivent.

Ils vont chasser dans la nuit.

Qui ont le goût et l'envie,
Des hommes, des hommes

Car, de la blonde à la rousse,
Mes hommes,
Ils vont coucher leur peau douce,
Mes hommes
Et repartent dans la nuit,
Courtois, mais pas attendris
Quand ils ont croqué le fruit,
La pomme.

Ils reviennent au matin,
Mes hommes,
Avec des fleurs dans les mains,
Mes hommes
Et restent là, silencieux,
Timides, baissant les yeux
En attendant que je leur
Pardonne.

Ils ont installé mon lit,
Mes hommes,
Au calme d'une prairie,
Mes hommes.
Je peux m'endormir à l'ombre.
Ils y creuseront ma tombe
Pour la longue nuit profonde
Des hommes, des hommes.

Pas de pleurs, pas une larme,

You need to realise that I'm not the one
You should call with an attitude

Now I.O.U.
Keep it for eternity

So to pledge myself to you would be no sacrifice
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U.

You could give me pearls
Give me all the fast cars
In the world
But there is only one thing
And it´s bigger than the sea
The only thing that matters
Is what you´ve given me

And I say
When I see the bright lights in your eyes
Feel like a bird that´s just learned to fly
From now until the end of time
I´m glad you came into my life
My gift sent from above
Unconditional love

You take me as I am
Not who I´m dressed up to be
Looking at you tells me
The best things in life are free
You´re the blessing that I treasure
With heart so true
No one ever touched me
The way that you do

And I say
When I see the bright lights in your eyes
Feel like a bird that´s just learned to fly
From now until the end of time
I´m glad you came into my life
My gift sent from above
Unconditional love

With your innocence you opened up my heart
I knew that I would love you right from the very start
You turned my life around showed me a better way
Thoughts of you will always make me have a brighter day
When I´m by your side it helps to see me through
Can´t express all the happiness when I´m with you
A gift from up above the one I´m dreaming of
I´ll always cherish you my unconditional love

When I see the bright lights in your eyes
Feel like a bird that´s just learned to fly

I hear that music ringing
It finds an echo in my soul

Somebody know me too well.
Somebody pull me up short,
And put me through hell,
And give me support,
For being alive.

Make me confused.
Mock me with praise.
Let me be used.
Vary my days.

But alone,
Is alone,
Not alive.

Somebody force me to care.
Somebody let me come through,

And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just is as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catchin' up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night I'm supposed to lose
Just 'cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

You can give up like they tell you
Stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
But I'm tryna tell you, fuck what they tell you

(I think we, uh) And in these dark times
As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It’s important to know we’re not blind
We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
I would rather die on my feet than live my knees
If I can't live free right now in the world we just need (A little more love)

A little more love
A little more love",A Little More,2015

You hurt me so
How could you do this again?
It's amazing how

Over and over again
You never cease to amaze me, man

It's a, amazing all the shit I done
Such examples I've been setting for my son
All she did was stay down and have my kid
All the time just to realize I ain't shit
Such audacity that I must have
To get in mint company and slap on ass
Damn, if I must say in my defense
I think should get credit for the asses I resi—
What? Goddamn, now she get upset
Huh, hang up in my face and block my number and shit
Thinkin', 'you fucked that up again, man, why don't you just apologize
For all the time you done got caught out in all the lies
For all the time that shawty put in on this long ride
I'm 'posed to show her compassion, I show a lot of pride'
Then when she looked at me, told me, ""You runnin' out of time""
But this gon' feel different on the other side, it's gon' feel amazing

It's amazing how
You hurt me so

How could you do this again?
It's amazing how
You hurt me so

I—I say
It's a, amazing how far I've come
Homicide, fed time, auto-gun
I used to take girls gettin' work on the run
Cut to the day and, man, I get in trouble flirtin' with one
Goddamn, like the one we love, hurt you the most
Broken promises and broke your heart, fill up the boat
Make it too heavy when the water deadly
(?) tried to tell you but you're hardheaded
They all meddlin' in your bini, 'cause they all messy
And I don't let them bitches stress me then be your headache
Got all my life to make you happy, this a small delay
Don't sweat the small shit, said I'd be dead in my twenties, I bet they all pissed
Drippin', spendin' eighty in Venice, same at the dentist
Hopin' the gifts'll change your perception of me
Look how I went from kissin' and lovin' her
To bein' just a nigga that she suffer for, damn, that's amazing

It's amazing how
You hurt me so
How could you do this again?
It's amazing how
You hurt me so
Over and over again
Round of applause for Mr. Fuck Up, please, everybody stand up

How could you, how could you hurt
How could you, how could you hurt
Me
How could you, how could you hurt
How could you, how could you hurt
Even a motherfucker who show you exactly what not to do, you know?
Anybody in life, man, you know what I'm saying?
How could you, how could you hurt
How could you, how could you hurt

Victoria Purcell,"I want to start things out by giving testimony 
Cause one of my friends got ill seriously 
Now the doctor told him ain't no way you gone' live 
But he prayed his prayer in faith 
And a miracle appeared 

 Its already alright,Its already alright 
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down 
Just bow and pray And then give it all up 
And know everything's gonna be okay 
Just throw your hands up 
And then wave them left to right 
And now do your dance child 
Cause its alright already 
Always surrounded by negativity 
This might be where I live 
But it ain't gonna change me 
Gotta work on my mind 
And keep my actions pure 
And when I stumble, I know who has the cure 
So any time your feeling down 
Just lift your voice in praise 
It'll pick you right up 
And you can come to Him don't be afraid 
Anytime , day or night He can give you what you need 
And if you pray your prayer in faith 
And in your heart believe that 
 
When life's problems get you down 
Can't find no peace nowhere around 
Trust in the spirit you can't see 
Its bout to bring you your relief 
Go ahead and cry now , Its alright 
Cause now you're cryin tears of joy 
This life ain't hurting you no more 
Cause you know its already alright

a name so wonderful to me.
This name is worthy of all praises.
Because of him, I am made free.
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.
The one who gave, his life for me.
Because of love, so unconditional,
I will have life, eternally.

This name speaks peace, unto my storm clouds,
This name speaks calm, unto me fears.
And when I feel, that no one loves me.
His loving presence is so near.
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.
The one who gave, his life for me.
Because of love, so unconditional,
I will have life, eternally.

Praise that name!
Praise that name!

Someday I'll leave, this earthly dwelling,
To find a place, my soul will soar.
And finally see, the face of Jesus.
And praise his name, forevermore!

And if not for those who loved us and who cared enough to show
us
Where would we be today

Sir, where is your son
Where lies his refuge
And if he can't come to you, then where can he run
Such a foolish girl, yet still, she's your daughter
And if you will just reminisce your days of young
You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done
Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes
See His love overcomes

Victoria Williams,"She lived on a curve in the road, in an old tar-paper shack
On the south side of the town, on the wrong side of the tracks
Sometimes on the way into town we'd say:
""Mama, can we stop and give her a ride?""
Sometimes we did but her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed, crazy Mary

Down along the road, past the Parson's place
The old blue car we used to race
Little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said ""No L-O-I-T-E-are-I-N-G allowed""
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd

Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around

One night thunder cracked mercy backed outside her windowsill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb on, newspaper-covered walls, and Mary rising up above it all

Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks, and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields, into the house of Mary

So save all your time, I am sick to death of your prophecy.
Cause the blood still moves whether you’re tired or not.

Cause all we do is take it.

Life won’t fall from the sky. Blood won’t pump through your arms.

We are liars. 

I’d like to see you at the end of days.
I’d like to see you speak a single phrase.
I’d like to remove all the blanks you saved load with bullets that we claimed to save for that rainy day.

It all came easy it seemed. We never get what we need: Sunsets and liquor fights, your Cadillac driving through the summer night. Blurry and blue eyed in the starlight, you were faking when I came and all these things worth giving up, burn it in your spine you were one of us. I know the wind blows cold and every city looks like your own, you said, “See I have this plan, leave and love every town with a gun in my hand.” So I put the record on as your hand feathers along.  Your first was rock n roll, but my champagne heart needs a little soul.

So take me if you want me we came here alone.
Or set me up in fire we came here alone, I came here alone.

Thier old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

I thought as now this day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long unbroken song
Of peave on earth, goodwill to men.

And in despair I bowed my hear;
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, goodwill to men.""",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,2002

Now let me take you to the Land that's still the greatest
Where the game we display is real contagious
It's filled with players, real gees and innovators
Beatin on haters like the Oakland Raiders
At the club we dance with a gangsta limp
Players pop collars and pose like a pimp
Strike out in the fall, ridin a haul
Now who the hell you thought taught rappers to ball?

[ Too $hort ]
10'000 studio sessions
Up all night, gotta count your blessings
You better take lessons
Who you testin?
We taught you everything you know, ain't no guessin

I even made on-line investments on the internet
With overnight Fed-Ex's and faxes

Movin units out the moms & pops

Rockin Roleys in 500's and keep the tires smokin

It's rough in the hood tryin to raise your seed
want to hide all your problems, blaze the weed
A lot of homies is dyin, boy, I gots to live
Before I go I better stock a grip for my kids
And that's all that counts to me
But what it amouts to be
Is who will look out for me

With whiskey on his breath

To figure out what they missed 
He went down that lost highway
Underneath the purple sky 
A legend disappeared before his time

Dressed in gold lame
The way he shook his hips 
Out there on that stage 
But before that faithful day 
He left Tennessee 
All of them were calling him the king

Well they like to call them hippies
Outlaws with guitars
But they brought a little poetry 
To the honky tonks and bars 
They might've got a little crazy 
They might have flew a little too high
Somewhere somebody's playing their song tonight

(Don't you know things change)

Now some say it's too country 
Some say it's a little rock n roll

O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine Blätter!
Du grünst nicht nur
  zur Sommerzeit,
Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.

Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit
Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut!

they see a bright new shining star,
they hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.

And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted

'let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace'.

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
they found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,
and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Where the treetops glisten, 
and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

how much longer dear angels
let winterlight come
and spread your white sheets over my empty house

summer move forward and leave your heat anchored in dust
forgotten him, cheated him, painted illusions of lust
now language escape, fugitive of forgiveness
leaving as trace only circles of rust

and the taste of dried-up hopes in my mouth
and the landscape of merry and desperate drought
how much longer dear angels
come break me with ice
let the water of calm trickle over my doubts

come let me drown
angels no fire no salt on the plow
carry me down
bury me down

and the taste of dried-up hopes in my mouth
and the landscape of merry and desperate drought

Vienna Teng,"I'm at your back door
With the earth of a hundred nations in my skin
You won't recognize me
For the light in my eyes is strange
It was years ago, god knows
When you strained to tell me your whole truth
That you were not mine to save
That you could not change

Would it be enough to go by
If we could sail on the wind in the dark
Cut those chains in the middle of the night
That had you pulled apart
Would it be enough to go by
If there's moonlight pulling the tide
Would it be enough to live on
If my love could keep you alive

I've built a lot of castles
Built a lot of blazing speed-of-light machines
But it doesn't matter, you know
They all crumble in the winds of change
So I turned back to breathing
I learned a few good reasons to cry
And I finally called home
Praying you weren't out of range

Carry the weight
I'll carry the weight of you, I swear
Carry the weight
I'll carry the weight of you

So will you let me come in
The mosquitoes have found me
And they're crowding 'round my blood
At least offer me a drink
Or a breaking of the ice
I'm wanting your anger
I only want to see if I can shake you out of sleep
And bring you out under this flooded sky
At any price

So carry the weight
Carry the weight of me in your heart
Carry the weight
Carry the weight of me",Enough to Go By,2002
Vienna Teng,"Strange how you know inside me
I measure the time and I stand amazed
Strange how I know inside you
My hand is outstretched toward the damp of the haze

And of course I forgive
I've seen how you live
Like a phoenix you rise from the ashes
You pick up the pieces
And the ghosts in the attic
They never quite leave
And of course I forgive
You've seen how I live
I've got darkness and fears to appease
My voices and analogies
Ambitions like ribbons
Worn bright on my sleeve

Strange how we know each other

Strange how I fit into you
There's a distance erased with the greatest of ease
Strange how you fit into me
A gentle warmth filling the deepest of needs

And with each passing day
The stories we say
Draw us tighter into our addiction
Confirm our conviction
That some kind of miracle
Passed on our heads
And how I am sure
Like never before
Of my reasons for defying reason
Embracing the seasons
We dance through the colors
Both followed and led

Strange how we fit each other

Strange how certain the journey
Time unfolds the petals for our eyes to see
Strange how this journey's hurting
In ways we accept as part of fate's decree

So we just hold on fast
Acknowledge the past
As lessons exquisitely crafted
Painstakingly drafted
To carve us as instruments
That play the music of life
For we don't realize
Our faith in the prize
Unless it's been somehow elusive
How swiftly we choose it
The sacred simplicity
Of you at my side",Eric's Song,2002
Vienna Teng,"Hey love,
Is that the name you're meant to have...
for me to call.
Look love,
they've given up believing,
they've turned aside our stories of the gentle fall

But don't you believe them.
Don't you drink their poison too.
These are the scars that words have carved
on me.

Hey love,
that's the name we've long held back
from the core of truth

So don't turn away now...
I am turning in revolution.
These are the scars that silence carved
on me.

This is the same place.
No, not the same place
This is the same place, love.
No, not the same place we've been before.

Hey love,
I am a constant satellite
of your blazing sun.
My love,
I obey your law of gravity.
This is the fate you've carved on me...
Your law of gravity...
This is the fate you've carved on me...

Though rain pounds harshly against the glass
Like an unwanted stranger, there is no danger
I am here tonight

Little child, be not afraid
Though thunder explodes and lightning flash
Illuminates your tear-stained face
I am here tonight

And someday you'll know
That nature is so
The same rain that draws you near me
Falls on rivers and land
On forests and sand
Makes the beautiful world that you'll see
In the morning

Little child, be not afraid
Though storm clouds mask your beloved moon
And its candlelight beams, still keep pleasant dreams
I am here tonight

Little child, be not afraid
Though wind makes creatures of our trees
And their branches to hands, they're not real, understand
And I am here tonight

And someday you'll know
That nature is so
The same rain that draws you near me
Falls on rivers and land
On forests and sand
Makes the beautiful world that you'll see
In the morning

For you know, once even I was a
Little child, and I was afraid
But a gentle someone always came
To dry all my tears, trade sweet sleep for fears
And to give a kiss goodnight

Well now I am grown
And these years have shown
That rain's a part of how life goes
But it's dark and it's late
So I'll hold you and wait
'Til your frightened eyes do close

And I hope that you'll know
That nature is so
The same rain that draws you near me
Falls on rivers and land
On forests and sand
Makes the beautiful world that you'll see

It was only meant to be an intersection
You kept fear of death in back pocket of your jeans
In the palm of your hand, affection 

It came like a sudden gust of wind
Leaving them, bewildered, to ask how
I recall last time we met you said we'd meet again
The irony is only bitter now 

These days everyone cries ""say uncle""
They want to touch your spirit lest it die
For this your sons and widow gather with us at the table
To form a healing circle for our new demise
These days everyone cries ""say uncle""
I retrieve the memories quickly as I can
Add them to the portrait we all draw in our minds
Your body gone, we shall keep the man 

I close my eyes and hope they do not fade
These remnants of a voice and of a smile
Images of landscape cloaked in forest green
Like your life unfolding mile by mile

Destination not you my one
And the driver doesn't know way down
How deep these bright-eyed feelings run

I've no intention of confessing today
I need to make distance awhile
But miles don't make your image fade
They don't erase this secret smile

Everything reminds me
Wet gray gold-lit street
Shop displays near-lovers meet
I feel the grasp of your hand still

This your face now in the glass
Breathing whisper what is this
Bent so close we nearly kiss
Although we never will

Strange that there's no hurtful need
Used to be my only sign
On my mind would make me bleed
Why is it that I'm feeling fine

Why is it this warmth within
No candlelight that causes burn
Memories of you begin
Well welcome friends, glad you've returned

Everything reminds me
Music surging bedroom dance
Crazy spinning sultry glance
I inhale your presence still

These your arms of daring grace
Encircle me what pact is made
Desire is your masquerade
Want me you never will

You gave me truth, I chose illusion
Now we are used to this confusion
But I know
Yes, I know this story has to end

Never groped for a connection
Never hoped for more affection
For I know
I know I am your friend, only your friend

When they pulled me from the gears
No one's fault, no one's bottle
No one's teenage pride or throttle

In a hurricane of warmth and word

Whose absence seems absurd

Through the cloud of crowd surrounding me

It grows but takes the winter hard

Says tomorrow comes, hold on a while

And dreams me holding my own child

Laughs as tears stream down her face

Just eight feet tall a pale and fragile thing
Bee stings beaches bright vacations
Sun burnt high-school graduations
A sparrow healing from a broken wing

Tiny apples on my tree's branches

And crawls blinking into the sun
My mother leafs through photographs
And thinks ""yes she was a lovely one""

Asks aloud what I might do

Been a decade or two or three

She's holding a secret that she'll never tell
Cause the myth is not supposed to retire
We'd rather it lit itself on fire
Or overdosed in a four star hotel

She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal
She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal
Cause truth this time is an ugly child
And mother and daughter may reconcile
But their faces will never heal

Don't go, she says, but he's sleeping
She says it to herself
Don't go, she sees herself rising
Packing her suitcase with all of her shoes
But something keeps you faithful
When all else in you turns and runs
Love turns 40

The morning comes

She's holding a secret that she'll never tell
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell
Because we were once cinema gods in the night
Now all we've got is lunch hour light
Where nothing photographs well

Don't go, she says, but he's sleeping
She says it to the dark
Don't go, she sees herself rising
Dressing in silence for nothing to lose
But something keeps you faithful
When all else in you turns and runs
Love turns 40

",Love Turns 40,2006
Vienna Teng,"It's the quiet night that breaks me. I cannot stand the sight of this familiar place. it's the quiet night that breaks me, like a dozen papercuts that only I can trace. all my books are lying useless now. all my maps will only show me how to lose my way. oh call my name. you know my name. and in that sound, everything will change. tell me it won't always be this hard. I am nothing without you, but I don't know who you are. it's the crowded room that breaks me: everybody looks so luminous, and strangely young. it's the crowded room that's never heard. no one here can say a word of my native tongue. I can't be among them anymore. I fold myself away before it burns me numb. oh call my name. you know my name. and in your love, everything will change. tell me it won't always be this hard. I am nothing without you, but I don't know who you are.

Dark water draining north, the heat 
Swells and bursts like plague. 

Sunday: 
Ever-so-faint slow tambourine 
Glides onward toward the grave. 

Who drew the line? 
Who drew the line between you and me? 
Who drew the line 
That everyone sees? 

Darling, 
Lake Pontchartrain is haunted: 
Bones without names, photographs framed in reeds. 

Darling, 
What blood our veins are holding. 
The overpass frozen, fires ablaze at sea. 

Who drew the line? 
Who drew the line that cuts to the skin, buries me in? 
Tell me who drew the line. 
Darling, don't close your eyes. 

(Lie as darkness hardens. 
Lie of our reunion. 
Oh lie if God is sleeping. 
Oh I believe you now.) 

Darling, 
Lake Pontchartrain will cradle me, 
And all you left behind.

Vienna Teng,"""It's so beautiful here,"" she says, 
""This moment now and this moment, now.""
And I never thought I would find her here: 
Flannel and satin, my four walls transformed. 
But she's looking at me, straight to center, 
No room at all for any other thought. 

And I know I don't want this, oh, I swear I don't want this. 
There's a reason not to want this but I forgot. 

In the terminal she sleeps on my shoulder, 
Hair falling forward, mouth all askew. 
Fluorescent announcements beat their wings overhead: 
""Passengers missing, we're looking for you.""
And she dreams through the noise, her weight against me, 
Face pressed into the corduroy grooves. 

Maybe it means nothing, maybe it means nothing,
Maybe it means nothing, but I'm afraid to move. 

And the words: they're everything and nothing. 
I want to search for her in the offhand remarks. 
Who are you, taking coffee, no sugar? 
Who are you, echoing street signs? 
Who are you, the stranger in the shell of a lover, 
Dark curtains drawn by the passage of time? 

Oh, words, like rain, how sweet the sound. 
""Well anyway,"" she says, ""I'll see you around...""",Recessional,2006

Vienna Teng,"He's a company man, your right hand, 13 years and counting.
No detectable ambition, a model of efficiency, far as you can see.
He knows every loophole, the art of fine print, massages the numbers 'til they fit.
And every time you ask him for another vanishing act, he half-smiles as if to say:

whatever you want, whatever you want, whatever you want is fine by me.
Whatever you want, whatever you want, whatever you want is fine by me.

Another late night. don't know if you're coming home or when. she's alone again.
But she goes on curating your domestic museum. she disappears in her loyalty.
She is a dress wearing a face in the doorway, opening her arms out to you:

whatever you want, whatever you want, whatever you want is fine by me.
Whatever you want, whatever you want, whatever you want is fine by me.

no one would dare to question you, oh no.
No one would dare to stand up.

but in the night she leaves the papers in a tiny pile: evidence for her reasons.
And in the night he takes the main accounts and pulls the files, detailing every treason.
I am the last one you'd ever suspect of setting the fire, of setting the fire.
But as you switch on your TV tomorrow morning, you'll hear me saying quietly:

whatever you want, whatever you want, whatever you want is fine by me.
Whatever you want, whatever you want, whatever you want is fine by me.

oh whatever you say, oh whatever you say:
I'll do what you ask me, I'll do what you ask me.

Vienna Teng,"In the fall,
We circle through the leaves
And talk about the little ones.
And we smile, but never say too much.
The moment always vanishing.
One by one the neighbors' lights come on.
Our October day is almost gone.

I know the border lines we drew between us
Keep the weapons down,
Keep the wounded safe,
I know our antebellum innocence
Was never meant to see the light of our armistice day.

In the spring,
We climbed the rolling hills
And talked about our budding plans.
And we smiled,
Our faces like a mirror
Showing us our secret sides.
But then the fights
The sharp words splintering the night,
How I couldn't be what you'd need
But oh how I could make you bleed

I know the border lines we drew between us
Keep the weapons down,
Keep the wounded safe
I know our antebellum innocence
Was never meant to see the light of our armistice.
But how much would I give to have it back again?
How much did we lose
To live this way?

And I can see those fighter planes

Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America, America

Across the field you see the sky ripped open
See the rain through a gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children
Who run
Into the arms

Walked out through the door

Voglio andare al cimitero e farci un rave
Voglio che tu sia un impero ed io sia un re

Voglio bere troppi cocktail
Chiamarti troppe volte
Amarti troppo forte
E addormentarmi un po'
Voglio non sapere niente
Parlarti inutilmente
Uccidere il presente
Tanto che male c'è
Perché non so se lo sai
O no mi sa di no no no

Voglio regalarti un figlio che non mi somiglia
Vivere nelle canzoni di Geatano e Dalla
Questa notte starò sveglio già lo so
Ma è per essere sicuro che domani ci sarò

Voglio bere troppi cocktail
Chiamarti troppe volte
Amarti troppo forte

Vijay Iyer,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,2005
Viji Krishnan,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""
Darling, I will understand.

Vika Bull,"In the morning we wreck the bed
You bring me coffee black and boiling
Then we start up again and the coffee goes cold
I wake up drinking from your lips
Kisses warm and tender
And I'd give up the word just to see you smile
One thing I will never understand (It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands (My hands are clean)
What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?
I went to town with a moody man, a handsome Dr. Jekyll
He was right by my side turning into Mr. Hyde
I ran for cover but I ran too slow; I was stitched by strangers
And they shook their heads that someone could do the things you did
One thing I will never understand (It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands (My hands are clean)
What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?
I must be mad, I must be crazy, everyone tells me so
Everyday I see it coming, now I'm facing the wall, waiting for the blow
In the morning you kiss my head
You say it was another
Now you're down on your knees
Begging me to forgive you please
I wake up aching from your touch
Every muscle tender
Then I look in your eyes, the way you smile
And I'm hypnotized
One thing I will never understand
(It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands

Drawing spiteful stares from the passerby

A mind divided cannot be blamed
For the torment caused itself
And for others
Still he is a man...

He knows not the cause
It is the furthest thing from his mind
Lack of thought is not a problem
For this man of straw
So named for his fragility of state

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels

Vikki Carr

This is the lesson taught to me
A long time ago at my mother's knee
She said, someday someone who loves you
Will make you cry
Though he loves you he'll hurt you
Till you feel you could die
But if he says forgive me
Forgive if you can
For you are his woman
And he is your man
When you're looking for roses
There are thorns you will meet
And remember my child
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
Well it's finally happened
Now it's my turn to cry
Oh my darling you've hurt me
Till I feel I could die
But you're saying forgive me
And I understand 
For I am your woman
And you are my man
Don't tell me about heartache
I've cried my share of tears
I've had my share of rain
But after the storm
No rain will appear
I just know when you hold me
My whole world is complete
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet

Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song (The Hand's of Time),1972
Vikki Carr,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
what will you lend on an old golden rule?

As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.

Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
and you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.",Alfie,1982
Vikki Carr,"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall, that's all.

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go.",By the Time I Get to Phoenix,1982
Vikki Carr,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

For once I can say
This is mine you can’t take it

As long as I know I have love we can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me",For Once in My Life,1982

But you just walk past me You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you

Vikki Carr

I tell myself what's done is done
I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool

I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares, let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

After a while, I'm myself again
I take the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore

I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings, and once again
I start to pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him , it must be him
or I shall die, Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

Vikki Carr,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello

Vikki Carr,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

You're not an angel
You're a woman
I'm not a king,
I'm a man,
Take my hand
We'll make a space
In the lives that we planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're diff'rent worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played
At the start like in a game
You could have stayed
Outside my heart
But in you came
And here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Don't ask why,
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever,
Love me now

Had no beginning
It has no end

Now I'm a willow
Now I can bend

You sign your name
Today at five 
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone
So alone

We can't find the love we once knew
If you think 
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow 
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire 
To kiss me
Or to hold me

And if you can forget 
The good times we had
If you don't think 
They out weigh the bad

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away

That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

Sabes convertirte en otro

No tienen ni un problema
Convencidas que la vida es así

Y si me dices que tu amor me esperará
Tendré la luz que mi sendero alumbrará

Verás que pronto volveré y me quedare
