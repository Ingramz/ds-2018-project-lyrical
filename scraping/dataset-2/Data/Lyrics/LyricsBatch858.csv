Pop Will Eat Itself,"1999 come knocking,
Time to get sensations rocking!
Peace, love and I know why
No hippy shit can try
To give you this tip,
Give you this sign,
DREAD ALERT!
I got mine.
Barriers crumble, empires fall,
The Karmadrome's inside us all,
For all...
CHORUS:
This is the time,
Don't be blind,
Blind to the signs,
Adapt to survive.
Never been in love with no one,
Sign up! Join the programme,
Within me, within you,
Feels like Karma.
Get your tiny mind round this:
Global warning, this is it!
Total wipe out, crack and fall,
When it all comes down who you gonna call?
Life is on the countdown
Time to get it slowed down
Before we get to meltdown-
The final touchdown!
Neighbor says he loves me,
Can't understand me,
Can't live with me,
Now he's gonna get me...
CHORUS

Pop Will Eat Itself,"Augusta, Georgia, late September,
One Mr. Brown's hot tempeed,
This man's possessed, he's restless,
Armed and dangerous, drugged and reckless.

Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely son
But he's on the run on a shotgun mission
""Listen here cocksuckers, motherfuckers, pay respect to my building.
It's JB property and it could be the one you get killed in.""

Cops arrive, ""What's this, what's happening,
What's what, where's the hot shot?""
James pressed his luck too far this time,
His pick-up truck's flat out and flying.

Cops get excited and grin with glee;
They got themsevles a celebrity!
7 cars give chase ""You're in the clear, this is the race of the year!""
""Faster Soul Master, they're coming at you from all directions,

Speed's your protection...Don't look behind you 'til south Carolina""
Cops spring a roadblock ""He ain't gonna stop!""
""He's gonna take a pop!""
Someone opens fire, the trucks front tyres are blown out

""Get the hell out!""
As six mile skid, trapped in a ditch,
In the lap of the FBI, the Secret Service,
The Russians, ""they're all in this, they're doing it to James

Like they did it to Elvis""
A ""good-foot"" dance in a dusted trance
Breath tested ""No Chance!"" Arrested!","Not Now James, We're Busy",1996

There ain't no pleasing me
No keeping sweeter

Don't fear the reaper",Me No Fear the Reaper,1997
Pop Will Eat Itself,"I just want somebody to love me
I just want somebody to care


I just want somebody to love me

I just want somebody to care
Oh, monogamy (x2)



I just want somebody to ** me
I just want somebody to **


I just want somebody to take me home
And to do the things that lovers should do



To never leave you is my ambition
To never leave you is my ambition
Oh, monogamy (x2)

To never leave you is my ambition

My ambition...

To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
 
I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me
 
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
 
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me
 
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
 
'Cause we all just want to be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won''t eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger''s
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
Hey hey I want to be a rockstar
Hey hey I want to be a rockstar
 
I want to be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
 
I think I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me
 
I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

Drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I want to be a rockstar
Hey hey I want to be a rockstar
 
I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills
From a Pez dispenser
When they ask why I drink all day
I'll say because I can
 
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Then listen to the fans tell me how damn good I am

Played the blues in England, I played 'em for the Queen
The Queen did love my style, but the Queen is not my thing
Goin' back to Dallas, livin' in the palace of the king

Couldn't play it in Moscow, you know that it was way too cold
Played the blues in Denmark, but women there they was way too old
Couldn't talk Italian, don't listen when they say
Couldn't find a chitlin Pizza, at any price I pay

Have the sun that would shine on my back door

I put it in overdrive, while you short circuit
Worship the ground that I walk on
I brought on, all the real niggas that you talked on
Blahzay Blah, so on, it's a done deal, don't even go on
Soundin nauseous, to choke on strong, to get my smoke on

[Chorus]
[Sic]
Talkin 'bout gats, ain't no bustin clacks, and ain't hustlin
Too many cats that want to rap, and ain't sayin nuthin
Foolin ya self, how let ya ass do it to ya self
When it comes to cash, we the ones doin it, who else?
Walkin our dogs, ya cats better beat yours
Hot heat reach why'all, before you even get a chance to recharge
You weak paw, me and my street niggas a' eat why'all
We all, guess they ain't no question that we sure
be	-song, soon as you throw the fuckin beat on
Dick riders ride, followers follow our lead on (you a fly guy)
I'ma have to air ya guys out
My shit is plat' before it even exit my mouth
S.I.N.Y. nigga, who wan' try?
Treatin a batty boy head, boom bye bye
I.Q. sky high, I flaunt why'all to hardcore
Conquer, why you frontin dunn? You don't want war

Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back

Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

And a hi hat with a souped up tempo

With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi

Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

Back again 
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case 
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything, 
But little boys 
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor, 
I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good God, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor 
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK 
Oops my C-D just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip,

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party 
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Everyday's just a holiday 
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy 
Get the top down, let my hair blow, 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body 
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah 
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah 
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty 
They said save it boy, we got you on tape 
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body"" 
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound 
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic

Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas

Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

Popeda,"I was a highwayman along the coach roads I did ride with sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side
I will find a place to rest my spirit if I can perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain but I will remain and I will be back again",Mä Elän Vieläkin,2005

I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside

That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be

Ready to flip when the heat is on
Hop in the Lac with Axl Foley
Presidential Roley make niggas want to hold me for ransom
And some bitches know me
My niggas told me
Them bitches love holding pockets
Get out a pocket
I'll knock your jaw out your socket
Then squash this
Fold up a little S-see
Best be on my see-H-E-S-T
If niggas test me
Let's see
Which nigga gonna meet Elvis Presley
Best be like what up my niggas let up like a Nestles Crunch
And start to punch niggas
Soon they gonna crunch
Fall on the dance floor
Haul off your ass into my hands slow
Get the show cancelled
No Hansel and Gretel in the ghetto just to let you know

Now what makes the motherfucking world go round?
You can sit back relax to my ghetto sound
This is for the hoes, niggas
Money and the yay
It gets mega trifling when your struggling and your striving
Surviving
I'm stuck to the strip for my grip
Penitentiary chances for my cash advances
What's my stances?
Brings this to your hood late night for the trip gold hund's
I want my fetty in tons
Gangs and guns
Five thousand stash what the sum
A nickel slick nigga and I'm up with the sun
So what you got for me cooking in the kitchen
Two birds hella sift got my motherfucking palms itching
So scandalous and my east coast dunns
Shit foaming and bubbling
For my money and the doubling
Respect that the Yak track got me caught up
All this ""D"" and the scrilla ain't never enough
I pop my title like cash I'm in this game for a Franklin
Serious rap shit got a young nigga banking
Street stanking
Motherfuckers know what I mean
Low-key
Plastered to the wall I'm behind the scenes

Started off that Crystal and budded
My neighborhood I love it
I'm never above it
I stays true to it
Better flew in like fluid
I'm knowing how to do it
And partner I've been through it
Sure I'm improving I'm the coldest thing moving
I had some confrontation with some cocky-ass Cuban
He said some black squabbling for some cheddar
And then he had to deepen and dict the vendetta
Well anyway I gave my baby mamma my Buretta
And told her that some Cubans might try to come get her
But meanwhile I'm a try to peel them first
But if they invade let your heater disperse
Cock it back bang, bang and do your thing girl
Let them know what's going down in your world
I want a woman with smarts
I want a woman with heart
That won't hesitate to blow your buster ass apart

Now who makes moves like chess?
Pack heat like a sauna
My bang bang clears your whole corner
Lights, camera, action
The bomb make my boogie make me hot like coal Braxton
I be taxing niggas like Uncle Sam
My red laser beam make you do the running man
A hundred miles an hour top speed you shouldn't of fucked with
The shorty lunatic
And fuck who you with
You should have came with your whole army
Now your duct taped buck naked walking home with no car keys
Yeah you're swoll like Lou Ferigno
But all that shine like glitter it ain't gold
See my crew laced in the finest
Matching Lamborghini and diamonds
I pack the jam
Make niggas say oh damn
Jiboh so cool

P-H-the-I-the-L-the-L-the-I-the-E-the-S.
We mess with phillies, we roll big phillies.

(I want to get blunted, my brother.)
P-H-the-I-the-L-the-L-the-I-the-E-the-S.
We mess with phillies, we roll big phillies.
(I want to get blunted, my brother.)

Suppress the brown bitch, up in the Crown Vic's.
Spread her legs and put the greenery lips around it.
Gets around it while niggas quit. (Woah!)
This bitch look better than Whitney, lick her titties,
'Cause niggas say the pussy be the stick-icky.
One puff'll turn your brain cells to dust.
Head rush, bound to fill your eyes up with the redness.
Suck her up, but there's a million bitches just like her.
Even dykes try to fuck her in the cypher, with the lighter.
Puttin' the dick on the ass an', everybody cashin, black 'n
Latino motherfuckers know they be mashin'
Nigga like whas' happenin'?
You can keep them sassy, the dickey used to.
Nicky Bone to top, to dump the hash in.
My partners, they be askin': Mr. Y-U-K,
Why you stay high off the hash and be smashin'?
With a hundred gun and a hundred click.
To the sto', they get phillies.
To we get blunted as we want to get.

[Chorus]

I takes my gat with a phillie, I don't need no quote.
Now boss player, this is how I like to blow my smoke.
I grab the phillie, cut the throat, jump to the back
Of a building, top player, makin' a little bits with a cup up of spit.
It makes me sick and upset when it's spit and silly.
Whenever you phillie, its all spitty and wet.
It doesn't matter, rich or po', I couldn't care less, bro.
It mixes when I'm out and let the motherfucker smoke no ho.
I shake the bud, mary-tramps, the one that tried to shove the weed up the fifth,
Without givin' up no cocker food stamps.
I know they want it, but smokin' for free, I don't condone it.
Don't put your crusty lips on it if you ain't got no chips on it.
I spent a grip on it, and girl, the cuffs out here.
And if you floss out here, you take a loss out here.
You're doin' too much catin' in the cypher wit'cha.
Lighter, tryin' to flick your big, if you ain't got no skits, you can't get hit.

[Chorus]

How many blunts do you blow on the daily?
Many money, I blow many, many, many.
I smoke plenty. (Well, won't your black ass quit being stingy?)
I'm not greedy. (Well, where's that weed fiend?)
(You better quit smokin' those beadys in my fo', hun.)
(Blow one for the po' one.)
(Nigga, don't you owe one?  Act like ya know one.)
No one does it better, break it down with my thumbs.
(Fuck the zigzags, and stack your lungs, make the runs.)
But no fund, no gas money.
(Well, even if a dummy has money.)
(He'll be a dumber dummy then bin his ass money.)
My blunt is my keeper, like cash money.
Blast money, stash money, the last money was considered.
Bombs, stick, green grass money.
Roll, but next time, I'm a put a little to the side. (Hash money.)

Hey nigga, I started smellin' weed and hella weed,
Then I started sellin' weed.
Bitch be tellin' me, they want to smoke.
To catch Mozik than a spellin' bee,
'Cause I smoke they ass under the table.
The hos' stable, pass me that cigarette or phillie.

I got that feelin' again, let's smoke that acrylin'.
Again, I said you willin' again, then we can walk the Poppa-ceiling again.
I storms in like a mighty blast of wind.
Inhale, exhale, the phillies rule my dome an'... (Aaahhh!)

(High powered shit, tell that nigga down the road to roll the shit up, man.)
(Man, why'all niggas need to quit this shit.)
(Nigga, you used to smoke too, more than me here, hit this shit.)
(Man, you already know do'.)

Fuck around and smoke the sprayed up.
Nigga be laid up, walk around like zombies, minds never made up.
Smellin' like ass hemp's and grine, cocky mouth.
Chap lips, fuckin' off all the poo-nanny.
If why'all gonna smoke, I'll be the designated weed roller.
Call me Numboy, the motherfuckin' seed roller.
But you gotta crack the window, though,
'Cause me and the lads like Whoopi Goldberg, in centerfolds.
Drink-a-lot, never like to think-a-lot.
Nigga, I don't smoke no more 'cause I don't like the stank-a-lot.

Nigga, I'm drink-a-lot, smoke-a-lot too, nigga.
Fuck, how you gonna say that shit, nigga, if you be smokin' cigarettes? (Fuck y'all.)

Poppa Wu,"These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me
Can you help me brother, please

You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking bout the love
The love of your own

But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand man, I'm all high off this shit man

Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other
Look at our children, what kind of a future

This is the training that's gonna be given to you by the Wu, brothers and sisters

The revolution, the revolution will be televised, televised

It's time to rise, and take our place so we can inherit the universe
The planet Earth belongs to God

This is nineteen ninety-seven

Every square inch of it
That he chose for himself
Is the best part
Behind every strong woman you'll find a strong man
And behind every strong man you'll find a strong woman
The universe is not completed without the sun, moon and stars
That's man, woman and child
To all you fake-ass niggas who think you gonna survive out here
Without your Black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
We are original man, the Asiatic Black man
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million
With the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million
All over the planet earth
Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war
That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality
Take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
That's the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through

There is only one God
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah

At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind
You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending, is about to come

If you take one step, I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know you got to be strong, gotta hold on

Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
Nor their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons
Peace we out

I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow,1999
Pops Fernandez,"Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you
 
Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you",Aray (Hurt),2001
Pops Foster,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.
 

",Farewell Blues,1996
Poptastik Karaoke,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road [In the Style of Bruce Springsteen] [Karaoke Tribute],2012
Poptastik Karaoke,"Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
Can do to you the things that I can't do?
I can take you higher
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire

Poptastik Karaoke,"I come from down in the valley
Where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride, yeah yeah

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well Mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight, yeah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride, oh

Poptastik Karaoke,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around 
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown

In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights between the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come 
To my hometown
My hometown
My hometown
My hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back 
To your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown

Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty five we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around

I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.

Poptastik Karaoke,"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

And she was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night

And all of my dreams, sacrificed

And all you knew was wrong?

Arriving somewhere but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams...

Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the end before the suns of mothers
Tearing you apart?

Porcupine Tree,"Something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifles through the cling and disappears
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare
In a dentist chair
Sucking in the air
Wire across the stair
Kicking down the door
At your local store
When your world of bore
Forces through the floor
Unexpected news
Wearing high-heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse
Paying all your dues
Tempering lullaby
Like a fractured tie
It's a worthless lie
To the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity

Yes I'd have to say I like my premise, see
Did you know you're on closed-circuit TV?
To smile at me

And a dream you had
Of your mom and dad
On a beach somewhere
And the boys aren't there
With the cancer threat
In a cigarette
Tempering lullaby
Find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A specter from the next life breathes his bargain of pain

Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for a name

I throw a window open wide and step through",Deadwing,2005

One hour after the participants have eaten sugar cubes saturated with LSD. 
We hear Brian and his fellow travelers observing their gradual transformation.

Brian has been amusing his friends by chewing on some plastic flashbulbs.

The time is now 1:00 A.M. 
Brian is unable to snap his fingers, and terminate the trip which continues.

He sobs, as his joy turns to fear.

Brian's rocky journey ended twelve hours after it so innocently has begin. 
He was shattered by it.

This young man never had a bummer, 
In some thirty-three LSD trips.

Porkpie,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Pormendade Country Band,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush

Them young triggers lose lives by the minute there
It might start but the fight never finish there
They all fucked up tryin' to get the gingerbread
A few stacks be the price for a nigga's head
Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians
Clips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's
A celebration of the loss of your innocence

Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet diabetic, big dog can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it then I fill it till it's pregnant
(Take the high back) face it everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
(And got right back) at it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down craft-matic, then I'm gone, black magic
(To the hideout) you don't want to gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy bluies got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo.

Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzi's cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you do the same shit to me
When you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mind set but still

Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is co-modified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get the itching man I got to get the calamine
Before I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

[Chorus]

One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Yo, so what you searching for? From birth
Born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy

[Chorus]

Life is fiction, competition, and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto; I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow--that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm going through things, headaches, abdominal pain
Tryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame; lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-train-wreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black dot gov like the government

Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit

Got immunized for both flus; I'm still sick

I'm so sick cause I'm infected but but I don't need a medic
Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet diabetic, big dog can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it then I fill it till it's pregnant
(Take the high back) face it everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
(And got right back) at it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down craft-matic, then I'm gone, black magic
(To the hideout) you don't want to gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy bluies got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo.

[Chorus]

[Dice Raw]
For the statements I'm about to make I will not apologize
Niggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies
Jewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic
Acting tough on TV but to me you seem a little timid
Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzi's cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you do the same shit to me
When you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mind set but still

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is co-modified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get the itching man I got to get the calamine
Before I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Didn't look it just jumped down my throat 
I was starting to die until I 
Took a trip to Bali 
Their eyes are god 
In a glass full of jelly 
Bali in my eyes 
My skin turned the color of the earth 
I felt like a tree 
People asked my name the next day 
They remembered who I was 
I took off my shoes 
And my feet they took root 
I've got Bali in my eyes 
When I opened up my eyes first thing 
Early light in Bali 
What a day it's gonna be I think 
It looks good already 
So hold me close before 
All the doors start knocking!

No one will believe in you
And all your friends are leaving you
And growing up
Moving on
Know enough when you were wrong
People might remember to call you and ask you how your goin'
And no one gives that theres no existing love for you
Maybe you'll believe in yourself
And you'll start loving too
Knowing this is the key to the treasure chest

The last place you look that you'll never guess
I cant ever stress enough now man
I pick up blocks of gold
Turn em to sand
Everything i seem to touch
Seem to turn to stone

Look back, I'm alone

Intro: see murder (talking) with Porsha singing. 
This is a story about my childhood years. 
For all my niggas. 
For my life as a ghetto child. 
. There's so much pain 

Verse 1: ???? 
I remember as a little kid. 
Growing up. Many of my friends didn't make it up to bricks. 
Punished for the shit that they did  it gets so hard to live. 
Mama cut the same tears  livin' in fears. 
Wondering if their son died or survived. 
But mama, I'm cutting the 45. 
I die, tell mama don't cry. 
Dry eyes, ‘cause how I live. I know to smile. 
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild. 
Try to make my money, pop. 
My eyes are getting slim. 
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near. 
And I'm hoping that the heaven's here. 
I cry, ‘cause the Lord knows how m! any years I've tried. 
But this life's a lie. It ain't not a hope unless a nigga die. 
Lord why!!, Lord why!! 

Verse 2: ???? 
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops weren't there. 
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share. 
These hard times, stressin' to sell nickels and dimes. 
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin' time. 
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years. 
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth. 
Who's the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga. 
Just a price I have to pay, nigga. 
My childhood years 

Chorus repeated once: see-Murder (Porsha singing in the background) 
My childhood years, got my shit in tears. 
It's hella scary. 
I'm trapped, and I don't want to die in a cemetery. 
This ghetto ties got me livin' in pain. 
Lord knows I don't want to die in vain. 

Verse 3: see-Murder 
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers. 
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared. 
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory. 
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery. 
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse. 
It's getting worse, until I'm covered up in dirt. 
The pain it hurts. 
That be the reason why my blast first. 
‘Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears. 
Memories up with child runnin' wild. 
I couldn't smile, because my motherfuckin' life was foul. 
A troubled child, stressin' from his childhood years. 
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears. 

Verse 4: Reginelli 
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick. 
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit. 
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick. 
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch. 
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did. 
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit. 
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills. 
Shading tills, ‘cause my brother got locked up for three years. 
After that a nigga start to grabbin' the mic. 
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight. 
Three years later, my brother came home from jail. 
Tellin' me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell. 
A week later, we was some No limit soliders. 
Gambino family, for all the readers and rollers. 
But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears. 
By the way I live. 
My childhood years.

Ha Huh man I'm tripping out right now 
thinking about my motherfucking brother K-L

and doin this and doin that nigga I'll never forget
  
Chorus:
I remember in the days how we used to dream
Now a days my life just ain't the same 2X
  
see-Murder:
I remember growin up, with 5 kids we ain't have nothin, 
but each other and i think damn i miss my brother
I give a shout to my mom she was there for me, 
even though sometimes i felt she never cared for me
Packin pistols wasn't even in my frame of thought 
We had a problem it was understood that we fought
And Money wasn't even on my most wanted list
It wasn't really necessary just to pull a check
And even though I didn't have a dad, 
I used to thank the lord everyday for everything I had
To all my lost thugs i miss ya well, 
I can't forget ya I got ya picture in my cell
and uh I never use ya name in vane, 
but its a shame how you'll never get to share my fame, my nigga
You never saw your son face to face but rest a sure that ya family straight
cause i remember
  
Chorus 2x
  
Magic:
I remember sittin in the hallways of school teachers lookin at me funny, 
""Magic why you ain't in class"", cause I'm tryin to make some money
Watchin koochie pass waitin for the bell to ring, 
cause i got a pocket full a dirt that I'm gonna blow on my friends
I'm headin straight to the streets where i learn the game, 
me and my niggas rushin home where we stashed our cane
I went from student to dope dealer hangin out with straight killers, 
i did better til i met the Millers
I remember livin lies slowly doin so bad so broke i had no where to go 
I was wearin the first pair a Jordan's after the fourth pair came out
I messed around and dropped out tryin to make me some clout
I never worried about my education I was confused 
I thought thugs ran the nation until I got on probation, 
I remember that's why i thank the lord every day 
took me out the game showed me the right way to get paid

See momma don't understand how you died in tha game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he's a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for tha rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said ""P be strong"" with out you we all alone
I know its been a few years you your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

I mean I'm hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
And when you left, part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin shhh ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember tha last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton 'cause on your birthday I go and put flowers on your
Grave
I still remember when P and see broke tha news to me at school about your death
Told me ""Silkk time would heal our wounds""
It's been oh five years and I ain't healed yet

A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take tha pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson, could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood don't show that man no love
'Cause kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of you're real homies is wit ya
And its sad can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up 'cause when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

My 'lil homie still incarcerated for packing a nine 
Now history repeat itself, there's black on black 
Check my background, there's evidence just hide it's back

Excuse me for my crime but in God I trust

I lose my cousin eight years for the time he spent

Try to make a change, they can't 
Cause they cuffs to tight

It ain't easy being me with my skin so toned 
The mother land ain't been the same since they took me from home

Porta,"Estoy en boca de tantos tontos y de muchos otros 
sudo por los poros, me la suda lo que hablen los foros. 
Estoy a años luz de tu crew de idiotas que me envidian, 
que me tienen rabia porque sus pibas me follarían. 

Sé que es duro, acepta el futuro y ya está, 
nadie me conoce pero tú hablas mucho y gastas saliva. 
Aquí no hay quien escriba, tranquilos, 
vivo entre palabras de verdad, 
el que se cree todo es más tonto que el que habla. 

Comentan mientras fuman petas-zetas, 
me quieren pegar porque no pueden con mis letras... pringaos. 
Soy mi fan, y hago rap porque lo siento, es cierto, 
es que soy experto en sacar fuera lo que llevo dentro. 

Y me divierte ver cómo está el panorama, 
los que acaban de empezar van de saber todo 
cuando no saben nada. 

Yo tengo algo que pocos tienen (¿eh?) 
fardar es hacer alarde únicamente de lo que se puede. 
Y cómo no, me envidia todo dios, 
intentan imitar mi voz, mi flow y copiar mi respiración. 

A ver, que no se me ha subido, repito 
tengo muchos clones pero todos salieron fallidos. 
Yo digo lo que pienso y por eso soy especial. 
No tengo ningún miedo aunque algunos me quieran apalizar, 
mis letras hablan de una realidad, 
vergüenza tiene que dar, amenazarme 
por no poder con mi rap. 

Asumo mi gran responsabilidad, 
influyo en tu mentalidad, 
haciendo rap 
tú no igualas mi handycap, 

Y es normal que rimar sea mi máxima pasión, 
porque vuestra envidia es la mayor manifestación de 
admiración. 

En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
cualquier mentira afronto. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
te crees todo lo que cuentan. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
no hay comentarios tontos. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
solo tontos que comentan. 

Y es que no puedes entender cómo es que aún sigo, 
si tantísimos me adoran y otros tantos se meten conmigo. 
Porta no se corta un pelo (¡qué va!) 
no saben por qué, pero yo sé que 
unos me tienen rabia y otros celos. 

Soy un producto de internet, 
es rap que va de boca en boca, 
mi nombre es Christian, 
pero tú mejor sólo llámame Porta. 

No juzgues si no quieres ser juzgado, 
¿decís que no soy MC por no llevar el pelo rapado? 
Pero llevo más de 6 años rapeando por lo menos, 
he aprendido a acelerar, pero jamás a echar el freno. 

Empecé grabando con un micro de mierda como todos, 
sólo que con 12 años no quise sacar mi promo. 
¿Crees que salí de la nada? (nah) 
yo escribía rap en el patio, mientras los demás niños jugaban. 

No me conoces, te equivocas del todo conmigo, 
yo no paso de los fans, más bien los considero amigos. 
La ignorancia es el mayor de tus defectos, (creo) 
si esto para ti no es rap, no sé cuál será tu concepto. 

Yo no elijo quién me escucha, así que 
que me escuche quien quiera. 
Que tú seas un raper cerrado de mente me la pela. 

Chapo bocas por norma y tengo el cromosoma rap, 
me graba Soma, pero eso sólo influye en la calidad. 

La fama no es como os pensáis, si os fijáis aquí hay 2 
extremos: 
uno es el de los que te aman y otro el de los memos. 

En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
cualquier mentira afronto. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
te crees todo lo que cuentan. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
no hay comentarios tontos. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
solo tontos que comentan. 

He aprendido mucho en estos años, más de lo que crees 
el respeto ya no existe en la cultura, así que olvídate, 
suicídate, ¿por qué? tú no vas a poder conmigo. 
Intentar ser el mejor no significa ir de subido. 

Ni me hacen las letras ni hago rap para ligar, 
pues tengo novia, la fama me agobia, y no es por fardar. 
Contradicciones no, ironías. 
Me gusta el sarcasmo, ingeniar, como muchos se rabiarían. 

Sé que tú la chuparías por contratos que he rechazado, 
hablaste de papá, y ahora tu pico está chapado. 
Dicen que en esto soy un monstruo y 
que por eso asusto. 
Mientras me guste mi rap 
seguiré haciéndolo con gusto. 

Hago rap porque lo siento, no para gustar, 
escuchen, no me culpen, escribo por mí y punto. 
Van de saber lo que no saben. 
Me escuchan niñas, pijos, emos, bakalas, heavys, metaleros 
y rapers. 
Góticos, skaters, y gente no identificada. 
Estoy aquí porque mi maqueta fue la más destacada. 

Seré sincero, odio la máquina y el reggaetón, 
esto es rap pasión, o hobbie, jodí a MCs con mi maquetón. 

¿Estás elevado al cuadrado? 
y yo estoy elevado al cubo. 
Tú llévame a tu ciudad, 
verás como el nivel lo subo. 

Perdónenme por hablar tanto de mí, 
pero es que me molo. 
Se me hace raro estar siempre 
en boca de todos. 

Mcs necesitan nombrarme pa' crear polémica 
y buscar la fama que no pueden ganarse con su maqueta. 
Aunque yo ya paso de tus gilipolleces payaso, 
lo mío es éxito, y a lo tuyo lo llamo fracaso. 

Gracias a los que me apoyáis y a los que no, 
pues hoy sé que sin vosotros no estaría donde estoy. 
La excusa que usáis contra mí es etiquetarme de lo que no soy.
Un consejo: infórmate mejor, B-boy.

Porta,"Es sólo una historia más
La bella y la bestia

Ella era bella
Frágil como una rosa
Él era una bestia
Esclavo de sus impulsos

Único día que les ataron esposas
Ya no eran niños
Crecieron,se hicieron adultos juntos

Todo marchaba bien
Eso parecía en su primera luna de miel
Juró serle de por vida fiel
Y ella a él
Una historia como otra cualquiera(sí)
Quién les ve y quién les viera

Pero el tiempo pasa
Y las relaciones se agotan
Se cansan
Ella ni lo nota
Porque esta ciega
Ciega de amor

Pero no aguanta la monotonía
Ya no quería ser dueño de una sola tía
O eso le decía a sus colegas de copas

Yo salgo con otras,pero ella ni lo nota

Bella estaba ciega
Pero no era tonta
Ya dudaba

Tantas noches sola
Cuantas horas de la madrugada

La primera vez fue la mas dolorosa
Te regaló una infidelidad por cada rosa
Y es que el perdón será tu debilidad
Pero lo que pasa una vez
Siempre sufre de una vez más

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo salir ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
Quiero vivir
Quiero vivir

Tantas cicatrices ya no puedo más
Me duelen las entrañas
De tanto sangrar

No existe un maquillaje que pueda tapar
Este moretón que es mi corazón
Ya no se cuánto más tiempo podré aguantar
Ya no me quedan lágrimas para llorar
El peso de estos años me doblan la edad
En cada rincón tengo un moretón

Dime que esto no ha pasado
Tu dime que el barrio ha olvidado
Mañana todo habrá cambiado
Y esto será sólo un horrible recuerdo

Sé que me quieres mi vida
Yo sé que no habrá más heridas
Mañana sera un nuevo día
Y otra vez seremos felices de nuevo

Empiezan las discusiones
Parece que a él no le gustan
Se vuelve insensible y agresivo
Y a bella le asusta

Lágrimas caían,tras un empujón
Y el primer puñetazo,
Te conformas con un perdón
Y un simple abrazo

No quieres darle importancia
Porque no quieres perderlo
Pero sientes impotencia
Y a la vez pánico y miedo

No puedes creerlo todavía
Después de tantos años
Te preguntas por qué te has caído en el puente

El silencio no te ayuda
Sé que no sabes que hacer
Sabes que fue la primera
Y no será la última vez

Créeme sé que no quieres más problemas
Pero no te quedes en silencio
Si tu marido te pega

Porque no le perteneces
Te mereces mucho más
Ese cretino tienen autoridad
Se la das y él se crece

No puedes detenerle
No puedes defenderte
No puedes hacer más que rezar por tener suerte

Cada día más normal
Pasar del amor al odio,
Se convirtió en algo habitual
Otro mal episodio

Bestia no te quiere
Pero quiere que seas suya
Para siempre

¡Si no eres mía,no serás de nadie entiendes!

Bella no podía más
El cada día era más bestia

Cuando ella quiso hablar
Ya era demasiado tarde
Se dio cuenta que vivía junto al mal
'La bella y la bestia'
Prefiero no contaros el final

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo salir ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
Quiero vivir
Quiero vivir

Tu final atravesó mi alma en sólo un compás
Callaste mis lamentos con brutalidad
Me has convertido en un triste numero más
Tu triste corazón fue tu perdición

Es demasiado tarde para ir hacia atrás
No volveré a tener otra oportunidad
Seré sólo un mal día en la prensa local
Pero mi dolor será tu prisión

Y si yo ahora puediera cambiar en algo tus miserias
Daría todo porque entendieras
Sólo un segundo de mi sufrimiento

Espero que al menos mi historia
No quede sólo en la memoria
Y traiciona nuestra trayectoria
Que no se repita jamás este cuento

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Quiero salir
Quiero vivir (trastorno bipolar)

Sé más fuerte que esa bestia
Debes salir
Vuelve a vivir

(la bella y la bestia)

Sé más fuerte
Camina hacia adelante

No te quedes en silencio",La  Bella Y la Bestia (Con Norykko),2009

Coño mirame, bueno mira da igual tu no lo entiendes. 
¿Pero que estas haciendo?

Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hara daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas

Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 

Gorda, se que te hace daño 
Pero es que la solución no es encerrarse en el baño 
Yo se lo que piensas cuando observas tu reflejo 
Pero tu enemigo son las personas no el espejo 
Ese complejo es el objeto de burla 
Meterse los dedos en la garganta no sirve de ayuda 
Si te hacen daño los demás porque tu también te lo haces 
Es darle la razón a los mas tontos de la clase 
Son espejismos fuera del realismo, 
Lucha por quererte a ti mismo o caerás en el abismo 
Eres el hazme-reír cuando sales de fiesta 
La gente te observa por la calle y eso te molesta 
Sientes vergüenza y al probarte vestidos te rallas, 
¡Harta! de tener que pedir otra talla 
En la playa no expones tu cuerpo por que te deprimes 
Tiras la toalla al ver esos cuerpos de cine 
Quieres perder peso a cualquier precio 
Se oyen las arcadas por el hueco de la puerta si están en silencio 
Tu madre se preocupa y a ti te da igual 
Sientes que va en decadencia tu paciencia para adelgazar 
No puedes parar de vomitar te sientes guapa 
Ves en la revistas los cuerpos que quieres y te atrapan 
Pero no eres tu, es solo lo que quieres ser 
Para que los demás muestren un poco mas de interés 
En ti, 
Pero es que la sociedad es así es triste 
No confíes en tu reflejo ni en lo que viste 
Acomplejada, lo veo en tu mirada 
Quererlo todo, todo sin tener que hacer nada 
Buscas una forma fácil 
Dentro de ese cuerpo se esconde un corazon frágil 
Se que es fácil de decir para el que no lo sufre y el que no lo siente 
Pero el ojo crea un espejismo que te miente. 

Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hará daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año.

No se, pienso que no deberías, hay otras maneras 
Cállate de una puta vez vale tu no estas en mi piel) 
Rozarte la campanilla es mas atractivo para ti 
Mucho mas sencillo y rápido que decidir 
Si hacer régimen o hacer deporte porque eso es duro 
Y ademas no te atreves a apostar si no es sobre seguro 
Solo quieres un cuerpo bonito 
Que te vean con otros ojos y reconozcan tu tipo 
Pero la belleza esta en el interior 

Aunque no te satisface que te digan que como persona eres mejor 
Te valoras poco y tu autoestima roza el suelo 
La moda es el señuelo y yo el pez que muerdo el anzuelo 
La imagen no lo es todo para todos 
Existen otros métodos pa' adelgazar existen otros modos 
Tienes un apodo que no nombran cuando estas presente 
Haces como que no te importa lo que comenten 
Pero quieres demostrar algo que no deberías 
Pero entiendo tu impotencia al ser solo una cría
 
Los chicos te rechazan por que no eres guapa 
Los días de llanto tu diario lo relatan 
Una forma mas cercana de la que pueda entender 
Cualquiera de nosotros al ver lagrimas caer 
Quieres saciarte y comer y devolver las calorías 
Te obsesionas con tu físico y te pesas cada día 
Cada hora notas sientes poca evolución 
Tu amiga llora por que no se puede creer tu situación 
No piensas detenerte hasta estar por fin contenta 
Y eso que tu peso debe rondar los cincuenta 
Autoestima baja y la confianza no la sientes 
Cero de personalidad y eso es deprimente 
No es necesario destacar estéticamente 
Siempre has sido totalmente dependiente 
Del pensamiento que tienen los demás hacia ella 
Su mente es débil tan solo quiere ser bella

Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hará daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 
Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hará daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 

Cada de día que pasa se te ve mas delgada 
Sigues viéndote igual aunque estas mas desmejorada 
Tu amiga te aconsejaba y no la quisiste escuchar 
Pides poca comida y dejas mas de la mitad(ahora) 
Pesas cuarenta kilos y te sigues viendo gorda 
Pero no es el espejo es tu mente que deforma 
La que le da forma a esa falsa imagen que ves 
Espejismos es lo que tu mente se quiere creer. 
Quien decide y quien le da significado a lo perfecto 
Si ser superficial para mi es solo otro defecto

Porta,"Despierto sin ganas de otro día, y será el último 
Pocos me creen, hoy llega mi edén 
Lo asumo y ni dudo, lo juro 
De corazón, advierte mi alma muerta 
No es una amenaza, es una mentira 
Que acabo siendo cierta 
Dejé la puerta abierta y una nota 
A medio escrita, se leía con dificultad 
Adiós mamá y papá, decía en ella 
Salí descalzo, sin fuerzas, sin ganas 
Me imaginé en el suelo, muerto, y nadie lloraba 
Paseo por una calle solitaria 
Todo está oscuro y llueve 
Las farolas me observan 
Y el paso en el tiempo me duele 
El filo de mi cuchilla me apreta, es ella 
Llegaré al final de la forma más fácil 
La vida no es bella 
Tan sólo busco estar solo ahora 
En un laberinto sin salida 
Dejé de pedirla ayuda a Dios 
Hablo con mi conciencia, a solas 
Ella me pide que apriete el gatillo 
Y tengo miedo de decir adiós 
Lo siento si he fallado una vez más 
He notado la vergüenza al mirarme en el espejo mamá 
Perdóname, te lo suplico! 
No se si me explico 
Estoy sentado en la varandilla de un séptimo piso 
Pero, ya estoy muerto, por dentro y estoy cansado 
Estoy harto de vivir huyendo siempre del pasado 
Fui cobarde, me rendí más de una vez estuve a punto 
Punto en mi libreta esta historia incompleta, ya ni lucho 
Páginas en blanco, tintadas del rojo de mi sangre 
No merezco ni una lágrima 
Mi nota de suicidio llegó tarde 
Firmé un documento con Satanás 
Para liberarme sólo tengo que saltar sin más

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Y siento como si ya estuviera muerto 
En un mundo de ciegos, rey tuerto 
Me paso por el forro el LP a puerto 
Es cierto, no tengo nada que dar ni recibir 
Sorrazos alerto, vivo boquiabierto 
Y apenas escribo, algo está jodido mi mente 
Me siento hijo adoptivo 
Demasiado impulsivo, me dicen 
Cautivo de lo negativo si volar es el fin 
Que alas se deslicen 
Calo mejor las mentiras, tras este intervalo 
Regalo rimas, con mi boca de escualo 
En forma de íntimas palabras sin pantomima 
Si no tienes el disco del Z, róbalo 
Pero yo ya no quiero vivir más 
Es demasiad duro 
Cuando muera, escupid en mi tumba 
Si apuro, he hecho el conjuro 
De la eterna estupidez 
Siento la rigidez en mis músculos 
Es liberador vivir sin futuro 
Sentir la traición hace que muera prematuro 
Es puro veneno lo que siento lo juro 
Con rabia la sangre sólo supe pedir perdón 
Cuando fui inmaduro 
Dile a mi madre que siempre la quise y que lo siento 
A mi bro que busque mis palabras en el viento, cuando sople 
A los que desearon mi mal, yo les deseo el doble 
Por haber hecho pedazos un corazón noble 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para

Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Estoy solo en un silencio que molesta y grito 
Escucha mi última palabra, léete mi último escrito 
Préstame atención, sólo pido eso, lo necesito 
Caen gotas de sudor y de mis ojos en mi nota de suicidio 
Siento no poder no decir mas, 
Pocos llorarán, pero cuantos se alegrarán 
Vi mi nombre en una lápida y ni se me hizo extraño 
Cuántas cargas he llevado para tan pocos años 
No hay nada que me frene 
Llevo tanto tiempo muerto dentro de mi ya no hay nada 
Tan sólo soy otro cuerpo, arrastrado por el viento 
Tan violento que sopla el destino 
No hay testigo, no hay amigos, no queda ningún motivo 
Solo recorro el camino, se que en las puertas del cielo 
No hay sitio para este peregrino 
Dios? parece ser mentira, hoy sabré si es cierto 
Lo de que tras la muerte, existe otra vida

Hoy es lunes, martes, miércoles quizás puede que jueves 
No se el por qué pero en mis ojos ya no llueve 
Puede que tu recuerdo me mantenga vivo 
Si el exilio no quiere mandarme directo al olvido

Son almas gemelas, separadas sin duda
Están pidiendo a gritos unirse y volver a ser una
Sienten algo y no saben porque, aunque las dos saben
Que es mucho mas fuerte que una amistad lo que les une
Y se puede ver a quilometros si te fijas
La vida nos lleva por el sendero que ella elija
Y yo llegue asta a ti sin ni siquiera buscarte
Solo con conocerme a mi podía retratarte
A ti, como un dulce sabor salado
Soy un amargado exacto cuando estoy a tu lado
Miraba tu melena dorada con cara de idiota
Te di mi corazon y sus instrucciones en una nota
De papel, quiero ser aquel que te tuviera
Si supieras algún día lo que siento
Si pudieras verte con los ojos que te veo
En vez de en el espejo no conocerías jamas el complejo

El calor de tus abrazos hace que cierre los ojos lentamente
Esto es para ti, escucha atentamente
Se cuando estas triste, y se cuando me mientes
Se que lo haces para que no me preocupe como siempre
Son imanes con igual polaridad por eso chocan al juntarse
Debe ser necesidad la debilidad del uno por el otro
El amor y el odio de los dos pudo arreglar sus corazones rotos
Una piel tan blanca no se olvida
Cruzaré los dedos de los pues po si se oxidan
Son almas más que cercanas, tu llámalo como quieras
Creo que algunos los conocen como almas gemelas

Querida alma gemela espero que me leas
Allí donde quieras que estés lucharé contra el viento y la marea
Yo se que es así, no espero que me creas
Busco mi otra mitad y no hay duda de que tu lo seas

Soy feliz así, con estas pequeñas cosas que me unen a ti
Como cada pétalo a su rosa
Tu perfume me despierta, pone alerta a mis sentidos
Conocerte fue casualidad? O causa del destino? 
Gracias cada detalle, por pequeño que parezca
Las almas separadas por el cuerpo necesitan estar cerca
Tu aura me da vida, te agarraré la mano si duermes y la dejas caída
Mi mirada sigue la perfecta forma de tus labios
No imaginas que sentí el primer momento tras rozarlos
El orgullo puede a la razón de ambos
Mataría por ti, moriría por ti, puedo demostrarlo

Se que no todo sera siempre bonito
Pero siendo solo tu, tu conseguiste ser mi tipo
No eres otra, lo repito, sabes que eres la única
Te necesito mas que al rap, para decir verdad, mas que a la música
Juré nunca decirte para siempre
La confianza que me haces sentir es suficiente
Yo un dia te soñé y hace tiempo
Sin buscarte te encontré porque siempre te llevé dentro
Eres de aspecto fuerte, aunque te dejas derrumbar
Te protegeré, no dejaré que la vida te vuelva a golpear
Ven conmigo, lo nuestro es correspondido
Si te vas ya no podré conformarme con ser tu amigo
Digo lo que tu pensabas, son dos almas conectadas
Tenemos lo que al otro le falta o necesitaba
Creo que eres la única persona capaz de entenderme 
Tu si puedes conocerme, la única persona que si puede tenerme

Over to my neighbor's house, knock on the door and they'd all sing out
Come on in, sit right down and make yourself at home

I sing their praises long and loud 'cause they're all my friends
And I'm mighty proud of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say in the good old fashioned friendly way

Well, they don't lock their doors at night cause they all know
They're a doing right and the good Lord's bound to have them for His own
If I'd go back to hear them, pray in the little fine church, they all would say
Come on in sit right down and make yourself at home

When I was a child of only three, I said my prayers at my mother's knee
And I knew right then from God, I'd never roam when I get the summons

When he picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel
This hammer'd be a death of me Lord Lord this hammer'd be a death of me
John Henry was a little bitty boy no bigger than a palm of your hand
When his mommy looked at him proudly and said
My Johnny'll be a steal drivin' man Lord lord hey Johnny'll be a steal drivin' man
John Henry was a steel drivin' man drove steel all through the land
Before he would let that steam drill beat him down
He'd die with the hammer in his hand Lord lord he'd die with the hammer in his hand
John Henry went to the tunnel drive steam drill was by his side
Before he would let that steam drill beat him down
He laid down his hammer and he cried Lord Lord he laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry went up on the mountain and he looked down on the other side
And the last words I heard poor old John Henry said
A cool drink of water before I die Lord Lord cool drink of water before I die
John Henry had a little woman and her name was Polly Ann
And the last words I heard poor old John Henry said
Polly drive that steel like a man Lord Lord Polly drive that steel like a man

Watched General Custer and the bloody masacre
There were muskets arrows cannonballs a flyin'
Yellin' screamin' a lot of men were dyin' there at the Little Big Horn

There were one thousand Indians standing on the river bank
Two hundred calvary waited there with pride
And I saw chief Crazy Horse leader of the Indians
Old Gneral Custer with his musket by his side
Then Crazy Horse started things with a yell
That shattered the quiet of the early morn
General Custer gave out a mighty mighty roar and they met at the Little Big Horn

And the sign read An Old Log Cabin For Sale an oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire and a light burning bright in the dell

Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more there's an old log cabin for sale

A welcome I read on the floormat an old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it with many a prayer prayed before

But now he was standing in silence too late yes too late he'd returned
And the sign read...

If you want to hear confessions of a broken man
Who once held a world of love right in his hands
If you wanna see a heartbreak right into the front of you
Just hang around my tears are overdue

When a broken heart and guilty conscience starts to worse

But he smiled in understanding though life to him had been so unkind

As I helped him across the highway
I cried oh Lord Thy burdens are much greater than mine
I can see the light of day and I need not feel my way
Yes Thy burdens are greater than mine
Just by chance I passed a graveyard saw a young man kneeling there
In his hands he held some roses on his lips I saw a prayer

How my heart would beat with joy to hear the old bells chime
Calling all the saints of God onto the house of prayer
Oh, such prayin', singin', shoutin' for the Lord was there

How I like the old time preachin' prayin', shoutin', singin'
How I like the old time reading of God's words
How I like to hear those glory hallelujahs ringin'
How I like the old time worship of the Lord

Preaching in the good ole days were filled with holy fame
Preaching for the souls of men and not for world acclaim
Under such old fashion preaching sinners knelt to pray
And the Lord would save them in that good ole fashion way

How I like the old time

Yes, they've all come to meet me
Arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home

Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At these four gray walls that surround me
And I realized that I was only dreaming

For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home

Skid Row Joe last night that's who I found in the dirty part of town
Lost forgotten with no place to go
Tormented with a bitter taste outcast by the human race
A mask of torture was the face of Skid Row Joe
He walked up to where I stood on the street
Said pardon me Mister now don't get me wrong I don't want your money
Though heaven knows I could use it
But you see this is my home and you see the other bar down the street
Well that's my home too
I noticed you starin' at me a while ago you recognized me didn't you
I said yeah Joe I know who you are
You was one time a real famous singing star one of my favorites
He said well I guess you heard they took my babies away from me
I said yeah Joe I read about it in the papers
Then he turned his head away and I saw the tears fall in the place
And he turned to me and he said you know Mister
This is the only place in the world that I'm not ashamed to show my face
But I'm gonna quit yes sir I'm gonna quit
And I'm gonna cut my hair and shave and get me a clean white shirt
Then I'm gonna walk up to her door
When she answers I'm gonna stand up real proud and tall
Then I'm gonna get on my knees
Then I'll say sweetheart if you'll take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life makin' up to you for what I've done
I'm so ashamed of myself and this I want you to know
Then I'm gonna take my two little babies and I'm gonna hold 'em so close to me
I ain't gonna never let 'em go
I guess I should've told him then that she'd already remarried again
But after hearin' what he'd said to me
Why there wasn't no way I could add to his misery
So I said good luck my best to you Skid Row Joe

And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin

Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

I can climb to the top of a cloud in the sky
I can soar through the heavens like a graceful eagle
I can swing from the wings of a butterfly
I can chase the wind down the canyons of my mind
I can catch it in the corner of my memory
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died
And I can stand and reminisce a while
In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you
I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow
I can go there and back and never leave my room

And I can take December and turn it into June

And sometimes I believe you love me

Porter Wagoner,"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures hang scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion and there's pictures of piece and of strife
There hung pictures of youth and of beauty and of old age and a blushing young bride
But the saddest of all they don't hung on the wall
The first scene is that of a gambler who had lost all his money at play
And he draws his dead mother's ring from his finger
That she wore long ago on her wedding day
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then he bows his head that in shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side
Now the last scene is that by the river of a heartbroken mother and babe
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver on an outcast whom no one will save
Now yet she was once a true woman she was somebody's darling and pride
But God help her she leaps and there's no one to weep
That's a picture from life's other side
Just a picture from life's other side someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide that might have been happy some day
There's a poor old mother at home watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear just a picture from life's other side",Picture from Life's Other Side,1969

From early morning until dusk we stripped away the blades of husk
Shuckin' corn shuckin' corn
I stood right along beside my two big brothers
And it got so we depended on each other

There was little time for fun underneath the summer sun
And it seemed to me like work was never done shuckin' corn, shuckin' corn

I've wasted so much time where the sun never shines

And I've cored many seeds from some mighty juicy grapes
But I've turned a lot of corners just a little bit too late
On my way through this world of mine
On my way through this world I had to pass your house

So part of my life was wasted there
And I've lived a lot of times on the thin side of a dime
On my way through this world of mine
But if I can crawl back in my cradle and walk this rocky world again

With shoulders stooped and heads bowed down and eyes that stare in defeat

Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts

Now you have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it'd be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passin' by

For it's written that the greatest men they never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts

Now you've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were propers and some were kings and some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts

Porter Wagoner,"(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)
If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor
Or would you need to change some things before you let him in
Like burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know that you'd give your nicest room to such an honered guest
And all the food you would serve to him would be the very best
And you'd keep assuring him that you were glad to have him there
That serving him in your home was a joy beyond compare
But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on
Or would you sigh of great relief when finally he had gone
You know it might be interesting to know the things you'd do
If Jesus came in person to spend some time with you

Saying catch me if you can. He led them down the streets of town 
Right to the traffic cop, And he only paused a moment, when

Made their plans for the bells to ring they would wed on the first of spring
So this man of wealth and his true love dear named the wedding hours
They would wed in the little church the one that had no towers
But he was the kind and generous man he told his true love of his plan
How to build a steeple for these good people
Yes they'll have their steeple the bells there will ring
They'll ring for our wedding on the first day of spring
But they say death comes like a thief and soon his heart was filled with grief
One week before the wedding day he learned his love has passed away
in spite of his grief and broken heart he kept the promise given
I'll build the steeple so my love can hear the bells in heaven

I smiled and said, I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone, I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life

I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured big champagne by candle light
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life

A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said, ""I'll take two bottles of your best""
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winkled as if to say you know the rest

I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life

I drove around the block till I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in

Lord, you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried, please put away that knife

And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the Amen Corner of that church sat Brother Ira
And he insisted every Sunday on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he'd get behind and miss the words
Well at last the storm cloud burst and the church was told in vine
That Brother Ira must stop his singing or the choir was gonna resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
And they got their big fine car and drove up to Ira's door
They found the choir's great trouble sittin' in an old arm chair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow white hair
Said York we're here dear Brother with the best res approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now it was our understanding when we bargained for the chair
That they were to relieve us that is they'd do the singin' for us
Now we don't want no singin' except what we've bought
The newest tunes are all the rage the old ones stand for nought
And so we have decided are you listenin' Brother Ira
You'll have to stop your singin' it's messin' up our choir
The old man raised his head a sign that he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I've sung the songs of David nearly eighty years said he
They've been my staff and comfort all along life's dreary way
I'm sorry if I disturbed the choir I guess I'm doin' wrong
But when my heart is filled with praise I can't hold back a song
I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
Yes I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
I wonder if they'll kick me out up there for singin' in Heaven's choir
A silence filled the little room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ira was dead
Oh the choir missed him for a while but he was soon forgot

I put a pistol in my jacket stumbled out and hailed a taxi
I told taxi driver to take me to her home
I remember walkin' proudly everybody said I yelled out loudly
Come on out or I'm gonna come in Mrs Jones
Then next thing I recall was walking to the forest
Lookin' for a place to hide her bones
I dug and dug for hours and then I planted flowers
Right on the top of the First Mrs Jones
Did my little story scare you oh I can see cause I'm so near you
Little beads of perspiration dot your clothes
Aren't you sorry now that you left me
Really now doesn't you want to come go with me

Porter Wagoner,"I WON'T HAVE TO CROSS JORDAN ALONE
Writer Thomas Ramsey and Charles E. Durham

When I come to the river at ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way
For I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died for my sins to atone
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone...



",I Won't Have to Cross Jordan Alone,2003
Porter Wagoner,"(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)
If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor

Or would you need to change some things before you let him in
Like burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know that you'd give your nicest room to such an honored guest
And all the food you would serve to him would be the very best
And you'd keep assuring him that you were glad to have him there
That serving him in your home was a joy beyond compare

But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on
Or would you sigh of great relief when finally he had gone

You know it might be interesting to know the things you'd do

Where the angels wait to join us in God's praise forevermore

But unless you've made no mistakes in your life be careful of stones that you throw

A neighbor was passin' my garden one day she stopped and I knew right away
That gossip not flowers she had on her mind and this is what I heard my neighbor say
You know that girl down who lived down the street she oughta be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
But she knows not to speak to my child nor to me
My neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse

A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes a sound that made my blood chill
My neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path and saved by a girl lying still
The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out oh who was that brave girl so sweet
I covered the crushed broken body and said

Porter Wagoner,"While resting the other evening by the side of the road 
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold 
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind 
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend 

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet 
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it 
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty 
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy 
Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high

If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry 
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful 
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful 
You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent 
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent 

Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy And that good 
Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy 
And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man 
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man 

Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord 
I won't take no more your time I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line Evening to you Lord and watch us over tonight Don't you worry about us now

Porter Wagoner,"Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening shadows come
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I heard my mother call at set of sun
(Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last)

You know some of the fondest memories of my childhood were woven around suppertime
When my mother used to call from the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home now son it's suppertime
Oh gee but I'd love to hear that once again
But you know for me time has woven a realization of a truth that's even more thrilling
That's when the call comes from the portasls of glory
And we'll gather round the table with the Lord himself
At the greatest suppertime of them all
(Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last)

I said I've found someone I love better but I still hear your voice call my name
I thought I heard you calling my name funny I still feel this way

Porter Wagoner,"How many times have you heard someone say
""If I had his money, I could do things my way?""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

My friends and my loved ones, I'll leave, there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind",A Satisfied Mind [DVD],2004

I'm tempted, my darling, to steal you away
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way

And I'm faced with heartaches that love's cheating line

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and could never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I've tried to forget you but what else can I do

WITH PAMELA ROSE GADD
Writer Shel Silvertstein
Copyright 1972

She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters, they flock around her, and they fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She arrives in all her splendor every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is a cross-town bus that stops right down the block
The ol' piano minstrel plays a song as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar, she's home again
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Her royal gown is a satin dress, that's stained and slightly torn
And her sparkling jewels are rhinestones, and her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's travelled and the wonderous sights she's seen
And I watch her and I pray God save the queen
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
The queen of the Silver Dollar is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But I found her and I won her, and I brought her to this world
Yes I'm the man who made a queen of a simple country girl
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom.......

Porter Wagoner,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way

Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Help me Jesus I know what I am

From the start I gave Julie all the love that I had
But everyone told me that Julie was bad
For Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight
Drinking and dancing and out late at night
She was everything evil with the face of a child
And I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild
I built an empire with my own two hands power and money to break any man
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't control
Though I gave Julie all my money could buy
And begged her to love me but she wouldn't try
For she'd only laugh as she'd walk out the door
And each time she'd hurt me made me love her more
I couldn't sleep until Julie got home last night she came in but wasn't alone
The things that I heard I could hardly believe
As her and the stranger made plans to leave
Without my Julie why I just couldn't live

Will never be useless for he's part of God's plan
Did you ever think of life as just a shop along the street
And yourself as a product displayed in easy reach
And you laid there for some quite some time now and pondered at your fate
Then you begin to wonder if maybe you'd hit the market late
Wealth had looked you over once and seen you at your best
But somehow you didn't fit his needs so he took one of the rest
Love had read your label and you lingered in her mind
But the competition caught her eye and she left you there behind
Fame had brushed the edges or the counter where you lay
And she pondered for a moment but then she walked away
Lady Luck had even picked you up but then you heard her say
I just can't afford you so I'll have to let you lay
Then one day they marked you down put you up on sale
And you got looked over once again but all to no avail
Now stained with yellow marked with age you heard a salesman state
Boss I guess I'll throw this out it's old and out of date
The keeper of the shop came then and he seemed to understand
He smiled and looked you over and out a caring hand
Give me that I'll take it home don't throw it on the street
It's old and gray but in its way it'll help my shop complete

Porter Wagoner,"Our first affair was just too dared to tempt our patience greed
I slipped around with you and found the kind of love I need
Now on the sly both you and I are deep in love somehow
These things they are we've gone too far to ever turn back now

We've gone too far to tell our hearts that our love was reckless fun
If we'd made a bad mistake I'm not sorry it was done
Though you belong to someone else and another has you now
Yet here we are we've gone too far to ever turn back now

We've gone too far when I can't sleep because I always think of you

Who turned their head for a moment
Who told you that my heart was broken
And who left the door to heaven open

And, tonight, I know the angels all will miss you

You asked me not to call you on the phone

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

Looked up in admiration
You painted schemes and lovely dreams
With all your temptation

For no cause at all you let her fall
And now she's yesterday's girl

You think it's smart to lure the heart
Of a girl whose lips you kissed
Is it just a game to add her name
To your broken-hearted list?

You've loved some long
You've loved some wrong
You promised each the world
Each game to be just a memory
And another yesterday's girl

Don't you sometimes feel that love
Is real the greatest thing in life?
Not one romance you gave the chance
To be your cherished wife

You cheat and lie you make them cry
And promise each the world
And one by one they each
Become another yesterday's girl

When autumn falls and you recall
The things that might have been
Then you'll pause and see your cause
The greed that's deep within

But unless you've made no mistakes in your life be careful of stones that you throw

You know that girl down who lived down the street she oughta be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
But she knows not to speak to my child nor to me
My neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse

Who lives by the river so wide 
And I guess my mommy's feeling bad 
And perhaps she won't be home tonight 

So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy 
Perhaps he has stopped at the store 
It's a great big store full of bottles 
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore 

So out in the night with the baby

A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly 
Down into her face sweet and fair 
And as the demon possessed him

A moment a second was over 
He lifted her fair golden head 
A moment the baby's left trembled

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

I pictured big champagne by candle light

That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

It's true

Who am I, what and why
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me

Of innocence decent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide

And catch a R.O.R. on some Jena six charges
Nah I put the thing away

But in the bing for days show you how I'm real
Come home to the truck with the Optimus Prim grille
Handin' out crack got the scene poppin' off
They not sleepin' on 'em the fiends is noddin' off
For real tell me how you a thug and you Superman (Nigga)

Major paper cake by the layers
If these dudes is live I'm the created player
They callin' 'em kings when they so so hot
Somethings wrong wit that picture must be photoshopped
I don't promote violence but when sparking the flame Blam
Arms start waving like the Carlton Banks dance
When them tools go pop it move whole blocks
Come around wit cha dog or get Kujo shot
