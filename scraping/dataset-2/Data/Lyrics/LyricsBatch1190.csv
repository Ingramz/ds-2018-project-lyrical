Rolling bones 'til the foreman comes back.
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about,
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out.

Everybody's scrambling and running around,
Picking up their money, take the teepee down.

Trying to get the workers out the way of the train.

Trapping evil if he can,
I tell you now his greatest plan.

Invented when I cannot tell,
Defied the thoughts of man so well.

But soon it sows its evil seed.

Unhappiness it only brings,
As man wants more and better things.
If not enough the evil lies,
But soon you'll find somebody dies.

Power and richness have been the cause.
Trapped in money's evil net,

For the very first time.

Hope it's not all mine.

I woke within my house of stone.
I ventured forth unto the day,
These things I saw upon my way.

Trees and flowers were wrapped around,
With people's castoffs on the ground.
Roads and noise of glass and steel,
And people snared within the wheel.

Tuesday looked into the sky,
Where birds in peace were left to fly.
Thunder rolled and lightning flashed,
I watched the world as people dashed.

Friday's sadness began to creep,
Upon me like the deepest sleep.
It seemed that only I could see,
Just what my world would finally be.

I draw the blinds, 'tis afternoon.
I let my mind find its own ways,

And ten-cent red roses from department store counters
Watching the moonlight reflect off the river
Beside where the trains cross the bridge and slow down
Trains with white letters on black iron sides
And white rushing water that all rolls away
And Little Miss Someone does not want to stay
Everyone's moving, with places to go
And Mr Zero - he sadly stands still
As the water goes one way, the train goes another
Mr Zero stands still, and Miss Someone don't bother

Yesterday's kiss will be cold by tomorrow
As campfires of midnight dissolve in the darkness
The room is deserted, the blinds have been drawn
Little Miss Someone has packed up and gone
Fast moving cars disappear down the highway
With signs that say: ""hitch-hikers: do not disturb""
Mr Zero looks quietly up from the curb
Morning has faded, and shadows have grown
And Little Miss Someone is on her way home
Mr Zero stands watching - her plane flies above
And with frost-bitten hands waves goodbye to his love

Walks through the park on a bright summer Sunday
And tapestry kittens that hung on the wall
They all die in the air like a soft minor chord
A vacancy sign, and a bulletin board
Mr Zero is wrapping his jacket around him
Speaking kind words that should have been said long ago
But Little Miss Someone does not want to know
The night is deserted, there's dust on the shelf
Mr Zero sits lonely and talks to himself
It's too late to change, the fine line has been crossed

To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...

First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

But you don't know how funky that I can get

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Man women I put a lot of fear in em
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

Yeah so what's the problem

Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

Yeah I admit you can flow

Well that's true

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

Yeah I can see you got it good

Oh that I know

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

The Young Dubliners,"While in the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

The Young Dubliners,"As down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I,
Their armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipe did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its loud tattoo
But the Angelus' bells o'er the Liffey swells
Rang out in the foggy dew.

Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through;
While Brittania's Huns with their long-range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.

The bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter-tide
In the springing of the year.
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.

And back through the glen I rode again
And my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see more
But to and fro
In my dreams I go 
And I kneel and pray for you
For slavery fled 
Oh, glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew",The Foggy Dew,1995

Wish that I knew what I know now

They steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
Love is blind and you will find
You're just a boy again

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
Wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
And if you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars

Have to learn just like me and that's the hardest way

The Young Dubliners,"It starts with one thing 
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme, 
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

The Young Unknowns,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California,2005

The Zen Circus,"Cammino 
Travolto dal mattino sul marciapiede 
Abbandono i sogni che non ho finito mentre da una radio echeggia una canzone 
Il cantante dice di non preoccuparsi che andrà tutto bene 
Fischiano le orecchie 
Ho voglia di scopare
Il bar pieno stivato 
La barista niente male 
Mi brucio col caffè e sfoglio un po' il giornale 
Mastico una gomma e ritorno a camminare 
Cammino 
La sera nei polmoni 
Il traffico violento 
Il cemento ed i mattoni 
Le luci dei lampioni 
Le merde di cane 
Dei lavori in corso e l'odore di catrame 
Non so cos'è che non va in me 
Sarà che dormo poco e ascolto musica sbagliata 
I miei cantanti 
Ti giuro tutti quanti 
Sono bugiardi 
Falsi infantili ed arroganti 
E nelle vie del centro esplode la rivoluzione 
Fra un aperitivo e i saldi di fine stagione 
E tutti ascoltano dovunque sempre la stessa canzone 
All'unisono, alla radio e alla televisione 
Ripete un ritornello e dice che andrà tutto bene 
Ma tu com'è che stai tu 
Nessuno lo chiede più 
Quello che dalla musica la gente vuole 
È sentirsi dire che andrà sempre tutto bene 
E che l'amore vince ancora 
Che c'è tutto da scoprire 
Che la vita va vissuta nella gioia e nel dolore 
Ed è tutto quanto vero 
Hanno solo che ragione 
Siamo noi quelli sbagliati 
Che hanno sempre da ridire 
Che hanno voglia di fare male 
Che non vogliono star bene 
Ma tu come è che stai tu 
Nessuno lo chiede più 
Si chiudono le palpebre 
I sogni ricominciano 
C'è un buco dove cado giù 
L'oscurità mi chiama a se 
Fa male ma illumina conforta la mia anima

Non voglio ballare, io mi sento male, devo vomitare 

Ricordi si parlava anche per sette ore 
Qualche sigaretta, nudi sul balcone 
La perfida Albione, il Marocco e l’henné 
Adesso il fumo uccide, nudo prendo freddo 
Parlo ancora molto, solo un po’ più calmo 
Non credo più tanto alla collettività 

Sono io, sono io, che ho sbagliato tutto 
Scuole superiori, i conti dell’affitto 
Ed il tuo compleanno non lo ricordo mai 
Sono io, sono io, o forse eri tu 
C’erano le elezioni, non ricordo più 
Votai il conte Mascetti e ti incazzasti con me 
Sono io o sei tu, dentro a questa prigione 
Sono io o sei tu, disteso sul bancone 

Non voglio ballare, voglio farmi male 
Non voglio ballare, voglio farmi male 
Non voglio ballare, io mi sento male, devo vomitare

Non si può parlare e non voglio ballare

Well my sense of humanity is going down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain

She put down in writin' what was in her mind

Where nothing comes up to the top

Nothing too very scientific

Where the time and the tempo fly
And there's no exit in any direction
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
Wasn't making any great connection
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Unless they're from another world

In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb

Not going to any great extremes
I'd already gone the distance

Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust.""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Come up and getcha, saved up for the train fare money
Kiss and make-up and it will be so nice

Just drifting slowly through a crowded street
With neon darkness shimmering through the haze
A sea of faces rippling in the heat

And from that nameless changing crowd
A sweet vibration seemed to fill the air
I stood astounded staring hard
At men with flowers resting in their hair

A sweet confusion filled my mind
Until I woke up only finding everything was just a dream
A dream unusual of its kind
That gave me peace and blew my mind

And now I'm hung up on a dream

They spoke with soft persuading words
About a living creed of gentle love
And turned the arm to sounds unheard
And showed me strangest clouded sights above

Which gentle touched my aching mind
And soothed the wanderings of my troubled brain
Sometimes I think I'll never find
Such purity and peace of mind again

Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'ma inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Fuck, shit up on the hurry up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowin' niggaz back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill

Hit you with the blast

Had surely come to blows

And had a drink instead

Big booty, thin waste 
Breasts so pretty they can't be real

Engaged in conversation yo and listenin to the radio 
Give it to em ruff, they say but treat em like a lady tho 
She never kissed a girl before 
But fantasized bout girls before 
Imagine havin sex with women, jus don't want the world to kno

Big city, long nights 
Pretty women on site

Radio killer
Yea,
Y'all think they can handle this one man
Alright
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song 
(This your song, this your song, this your song, this your song)
Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,)
Cause I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride Mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle

[Chorus]
Shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

She likes Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy

[Chorus]

(Cause I'm your baby)
You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
Cause he ain't nothin' like me (no)
You can search but you never gone find
A love thats quite like mine (no)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cause I'm your baby

In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know I'm a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't care
She all in the rear-view doin' her here
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhere
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even tho I had to pay

The way your lip looks after you apply the gloss

Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Cardash and be a lady addict
You know whats a crazy thing
A girl would make you wait longer than ac green

Dashiki kimono or turban

I need help tryin' to solve it
Cause meeting after meeting and I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide them, I'ma find them, on the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it with my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth, that'll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is.

I'm a beast for they're treats
An animal for they're crackers
Head to feet they so damn sweet

Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection

She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye

Still fucking with them hood superstars (superstars)
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar like pimping ain't easy

Well it ain't
All them faces in that Laker paint
Casa by the lake
Make a little nigga faint
Balling is what I does
I ain't messing with you cant's
I'm a can do negro
A real life California hero
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account
Nigga ain't ya mad at me
I'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine
Yeah you see it fool
Snoop's everywhere, Italy I'm heavy there
Did a show in Rome like hoe say you ain't never there
Talking 'bout you popping bottles
I don't see none
You made it rain where?
I don't see a wand
Go on get it off
That's what they like to hear
It's your money pimp
We don't fight it here
It's hard enough to be me
Not trying to be you is something I got to see
Until then I'mma

[Chorus]

This ain't a joke a loc' made it look easy to you
I been through some shit
I made it easy for ya
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies
Tell 'em what she want to hear
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here
And Snoopy is your homie
Nah nah girl he out of here
Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here
You a fool Jack
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch
Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool
I pop cause I'm the man
Now watch me and Kells

[Chorus]

I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag
Pimping in my cup
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause that's how I does
Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

[Chorus]

To all my honeys in the club getting money with the thugs
Keep it pimping baby
Keep it pimping baby
Southside, westside, eastside, northside
Keep it pimping baby
Keep it pimping",Pimpin Ain't Ez,2009

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight

Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child

Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (uh, that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies

Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin'
Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew
I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too

And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe
So come on ladies let's get up out of this club
Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party come on fuck with us

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby
So tell me that you want me, baby, baby
And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine

Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks
And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid
Sounds like heaven's callin' us
And girl, well, it's about makin' love

If you choose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up
Somethin' about being with you make me wanna, baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby

You can play all you want but I know you feel it too
For 3 weeks you been talkin' about extra bedrooms
In New York meetin' with the realtor
There somethin' you wanna tell me, just say it, I'll pay it

Oh girl, I'ma take care of you
And I'ma still hold you like we brand new
So don't get it twisted for 30 somethin' weeks
I'm still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Take you out to eat uh-uh
Wine and dine uh-uh
Shoppin' spree, uh-uh
You sexin' me uh huh
See, I'm not cheap
Or selfish babe (no ah)

Her phone ringin' off that chain, she just hit ignore and say

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go 
Let me go 
You've got to let me go 
Right or wrong 
Let me go 
I'm on my path 
Let me go 

My mama loved me more than I do 
She said you Pop was jus' like you 
Trapped in a vicious circle 
Jesus youngest disciple 
Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me 
Make it the bible 
Start calling myself the king 
For lack of a better title 
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment 
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities 
Like a choir recital 
Now while I do not care who telling 
Meanwhile selling powder puts food in the bellies 
Well it's, unfortunate 
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages 
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it 
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar 
Mixing at ton, a balloon 
Consumed with the same way of life I left 
Everything I know now learned by myself 
All you see are the whips 
The Maserati's Ferrari's 
So they don't sympathize 
Don't nobody feel sorry 
No mercy 

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go

Everybody's standing and waiting an they're hating 
Gospels say they should forgive me 
They'd rather hand me to Satan 
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy 
Boy you got to be kidding 
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me? 
Remember that 
When he was here 
And when he died you realized you need him here 
God with me partner 
Ain't no one for me to fear 
Hindsight twenty twenty
Future not as clear 
But I'm a rider till I die 
Put bullets 'tween my eye 
I just ask that I can make my peace with god and say goodbye 
Fuck up the world like Lady Di 
One the day he died 
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried 
To be a person all they wanted better verses 
They could market to the merchants 
But when they closed curtains 
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect 
But when you're rich nobody gives a shit 
No mercy 

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go 
You've got to let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go",No Mercy,2010

Climaxing on my hand, she runnin it back, workin it
Like you don't understand

She wants that old thing back
That ride it like a pony
That ""get up in the morning and put it on me""
She's so horny, she wants that old thing back
That ""mm-hmm, gimme some""
Rocket shit, that rocket ship don't stop til I'm done

[Chorus]
She want that ghetto, ghetto, and I got that ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, and I got that ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, and I got that ghetto
She want that ghetto, she need that ghetto
Like ghetto, ghetto, and I got that ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, she want that ghetto
She need that ghetto, she want that ghetto
That ghetto, ghetto, that um-hum ghetto

She said ""Dream do it to me like this
Why can't you do it to me like that?""
For the last forty eight months, you can't front
I put that ass on the map
See I created this sound, yes sir I shut it down
There's only one #1
There other niggas my sons
And you can never be, be like me
And you can never do it, do it like me
Ain't none of these niggas seeing me
Ain't none of these niggas repeating me
Ain't none of these niggas defeating me
Unless they get me to murk myself
I just murked myself

She wants that old thing back
That ride it like a pony
That ""get up in the morning and put it on me""
She's so horny, she wants that old thing back
That ""mm-hmm, gimme some""
Rocket shit, that rocket ship don't stop til I'm done

She want that
Real nigga on the wishlist, used to blow me off
Now she tryna blow me kisses
Walk into the room, tell me how could I miss it?
Girl, you working like you need assistance, tipping
Girl you workin' like you need a pension
Bent that thang over, let a nigga pinch it
Rich nigga shit: I could put you on a boat
Popping champagne, now you look like its Big Pimpin
I work all day, fuck all night, finna to make you cuss all night

Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, but you're patient with me, babe
Wanna to show you how much I care about your heart
Show you how much I don't like (like) being apart

But now you on that bullshit
You used to sex me crazy
You used to call me baby
Now all you do it nag me like a 5 year old from the backseat
You used to be so confident
But all that shit came and went
Used to be anti-internet
But now you constantly blogging and shit!

You used to strip for a nigga
Now you ain't got nothing but lip for a nigga
Halfway decent for me, but you dress up for your girlfriends?
Listening to what they say god your ass w/out a husband
Put you in a Benz, you did everything to get me

And scream out fuck me, but won't fuck me
Oh Hell to the no! Now I'm all up in the clubs
Now I'm all up in the mall

Yesterday you didn't give a fuck, now you asking where I been

Talking about: ""where she think she going in that outfit?""
She don't even love me, she loves the competition
Every man out there: I hope you're listening

There's nothing at home, so I'm searching for love
Tried to get through, but you don't give a fuck

'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Yeah, feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

This the feeling though that I been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one-way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Tim's, in the Lamb, mixing it with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah
Lately I've been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see that Lysol, Dijon and Parmesan
Funny thing about it you always act like you knew
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast-forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me how of we always used to dress up as a family
And go to Sunday service, and being in church, singin'
Ain't been to church in awhile
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building
It's about how you praisin' him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all-time-low self and throw me a jetpack, whoa
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone
Or any other girl looked like Lisa Bonet
Who was jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise with me being away
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess the time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of you 'til I see you myself

Praise, so many times I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise, for all the times that you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried and all the days I coulda died
Because of you I survived, because of you I'm still alive

Thank you God for all my setbacks
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back

Bbeen a while since we spoke but it's hidden fo'

Sad it had to be at another funeral
That was a wild summer, same one that took Rod from us
When I heard they stabbed him in his side
Swear to God I could feel that shit in my stomach
Yo I heard it was some niggas from the wild hunnids
That sneaky bitch set you up man
Fuck man that shit was tough man
Over some petty ass weed
I was like anybody but Cam
I called Autumn immediately
Needed someone to feed it to me

I think about bullet holes runnin through your dome
I just saw you that week on 53rd
I'm tearing up man it's hard to put this shit in words
It's like Macklemore at the Grammys, man
I just feel like you got some shit you didn't deserve
You was a good nigga, but the good niggas always die young, fucking with them hood niggas
I know you had your hands in that dirt, but
They ain't have to end you out outside that Kenwood Liquors

You were just a little bony homie
To see you in front of thousand of people
Screaming my name, man that shit did a lot for me
Sometimes heaven gets lonely
I talked to your grandma, she said ""tell Vic I'm proud for me""

What up young vic?
You don't know my name
I'm just another nigga caught up in the street game
I been through things, seen things
I know this was might sound crazy but let me explain
It was a dark night, I got call from this broad right
She said I'm hittin you about this shit
Because I know you got stripes like off white
I got a lick for you, you got a car right?
You'll need it for my crib in an hour
Hold on one second, he just got out the shower
Who you talkin' to, nothin' I'm talkin' to my momma
Now listen close, I can't talk any louder
He got 10 pounds in his trunk
He's bout to take it up north from my crib to drop it off to the plug
You could get him raw for the cash if you quick
And I know he ain't strapped because I just hid his gun
I asked her who the nigga was she ain't say a name
I just had a baby man I had to make some change
I was hurt, how could I turn away a stain
So I called up my brothers like Damon Wayans
We piled up in my Monte Carlo, pulled up to the bitch crib
Seen a white Ford Explorer shorty just told me to follow
He was sittin on 75th, he bent on stony and made a stop at the Kenwood Liquors
He ran inside to get a drink
When he stepped out he had a bottle of Hennessy in his hand
We rolled up and put that banger to his face
I told him give me everything in the car, nigga everything
He start stumbling like ""I ain't got anything""
I said ""shut the fuck up man, open the trunk up fam
Before I gotta let this hammer bang""
He reached for the keys and put him in
The trunk popped open I saw the weed in saran
I told him step the fuck back, he ain't listen though
His hand move he started reaching again
I was scared, I ain't gon lie
That's what it was
I thought he had a gun, my eyes went black
I let two shots go
Before I knew it he was layin' in the ground in a puddle of blood
I know it ain't right
I think about it every night
I ain't even mean to take his life
We livin' in the streets where ain't shit free and your man just had to pay the ultimate price

Youngin' in the ninth grade, he got a Smith and Wesson
Grew up with the goons, now he need protection
He dropped outta school, then he got arrested
Lord with a blessing, I just hope he learned his lesson

They told us, if we make a sale, we would run a check in

The powers that be, out by the river, are shuffling their feet
But the night is full of car alarms and sideways glances
In this land of milk and money you don?t get your second chances

Cars are burning on the slip roads, the bars are full of sailors
Spent a long time trying to fathom which were trips and which were trailers
England has been bleeding into every police station
Into every schoolyard, every war and every state occaision

We?re the gun cotton
They?ll blast us all in line
This time

Children in the boxes paint the underpass red
The graffiti on the park bench, the faded A to Z
They?ll make you fat with dreams and sequence on the silver screen
?Til you?re full of hope and tragedy and crash-site steam

We?re the gun cotton
They?ll blast us all in line

Said, we?re the gun cotton
They?ll blast us all in line

England has been bleeding, she can?t leave it at that
She?s waiting round the corner wit a switch-blade in her hand

Take your time and take a bow; this place is gonna blow

Some little joke of chemistry 
With all our sun bleached history 
Fading as the light gets strong and 
We are brave and we are fakes of 
Tortured art and higher stakes 
And winters knocking at the gates 
But the clocks are wrong 

I am the steel, I am the dare

Setting off those warning flares 
Till the sky got light 
And you are the seasons, you are the free fall

Here's the reasoning behind it all

A funeral pyre for the wise and the clowns 
A little drunk this time around 
But the feeling's there 
They're drawing out their pocket knives 
Till just the singular survives 
For all the currency it buys 
They don't much care 

'Cause I've struggled for directions
A blank page as far as I can see 
But I'm open to suggestions
So you tell me 
You tell me

Now colours blazing through the sky 
With autumn fury in our eyes 
We'll gather every battle cry 
And lay them at their door

To turn poetry to self defence 
I guess that what I really meant 
Was that's what it's for

And I heard the radio sneeze into the evening 
And all the bat-squeak singers selling fake hope to the sleeping

Burning acid holes in the magazine racks 
I saw Jenny have a baby in the street 
Where they're playing blind mans bluff between the dying and the concrete 

I've seen a paper corpse holing up a doorway 
I heard the lonely voices singing “yeah I did it your way” 
And I held the future up to a looking glass 
It bears a striking resemblance 
To the embers of the past 

I've seen the chorus-girls the ribbon and the rot 
Seen electoral debates on the glass-rim of a whiskey shot 
And I caught the glimmer in a hurricanes eye 
I've seen these AK-47's with their noses to the sky

And outside the all night in an orchestra of rain
You fell in love with a hurricane
You were torn like a road map and lost in the crowd
And the dirt is your lover now

Fingernails, thorn trees, my fickle heart too
So many things in this sad little world grow back
Except for you

The streets of my home town still look the same
But behind shaking fingers they're whispering your name
It's funny the tears that time will allow

And the small time pushers predicting snow again

Behind the leading voices and behind the drunken sailors
Put our hands together, pray for these drowning men to save us

About the strength of the equation
Before it finally chalked up on just one more brick wall

She shone just like a crucifix, an instrument of grace
And they got on like children, they got a hotel room
They got a new religion, a needle and a spoon

And they gave thanks to the heavens, but the devil held their hands
And they walked that great divide between Disciples and partisans

And the brown and the Bible, they were never quite enough

And the honeyed breath of summer is sweet and overgrown
But its always autumn sings ""its not too late To find your way back home""
To find your way back home""

And a bell sometimes reminds them, or the singing in the wind
The striking of a match, the smell of Paraffin
And some folks are drawn to the flames, and some just want to hide

They burn from the inside
Yeah, the lonely are the prettiest of all, they burn from the inside",The List,2006

Loudly, I chanted my praise.

And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.

I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:

Behold! - 'tis not the rain; thence me it has to be -
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear;
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocence, yet thou let'st thy lass into peril -
Thou let'st me be parched;
My heart is of frailty, my pale skin is hued damask.
When thou thy tears hast hidden, ""Come back!"", thou sayest -
There I soon am to be - but how am I to run when my bones, my heart!
Thou hast me bereaft? -
But run thou sayest; I run -
And there and then I behold that a time will come when I again dead will be.
Thou tell'st me to leave without delay -
I leave with my bodkin and my tears in my hands;
Lo! - the shadows, the sky - descending;
So by a dint of smite I gait ere I run and melt together with dusk.
In my mind in which is this event,
But it seems as if naught is to change anyway?
After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths -
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me,
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world:
All the beautiful moments shared, deliberatlely push'd aside -

Theatre of Tragedy,"This interference's shifting
A soft accent cascading
A second glimpse of falling TVs
Draws me in too easily
Some kind of nonchalance
Contains my will to chance
The avidity of youth
The naivety of you

Somewhere where silence ended is where I reassemble
My lens to take your photograph
Which I throw away autographed
And there's an illegal tender
And there's a senseless sensor
And there's a notion we don't need

And they leave just like you
Never come undone
You deceive just like me
Next to me
Though I'll never even see you
Next to you
Never seen such beauty

The third one says she's hollow
A moist and lashing spoken tongue
The words silent since I was young
In the flicker light we're interlaced and face to face

And there's a soft surrender
And there's a stark contender
And there are notions we do need

I will never come undone",Silence,2006

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

Seht uns hier zugleich, nur noch Fragen, die blieben
Für die Komödie gezahlt, aber für das Drama geblieben

Quando sotto casa gli hanno sparato
Ma quanta violenza che passa in tele
Però meglio in tele che dentro casa
Frate, lavoravo in un ufficio
Giuro stavo diventando pazzo
Ci pagavo a malapena l'affitto
In Italia non funziona un cazzo
Sognavo nella tasca i contanti
Ho vomitato le rime più crude
Che brutta vita fanno i cantanti

E questo è il ricambio generazionale

E le ventenni vanno a letto con i vecchi
Per pagarsi una borsa di Gucci
A Milano piove spumante
Perché lo Champagne è francese
Un matto gira in centro in mutande
E uccide i passanti con un machete
La politica ci vuole divisi
In TV sento parlare di Isis
Su nel cielo, guarda, volano missili
Fuori fighe da sfilate Intimissimi
Droga gira in questi party, unisciti
Ogni tanto vedi c'è chi collassa
Gli adulti che si fanno selfie in crisi
Non trovano parole neanche per gli hashtag

Thelma Carpenter,"Sweet thing, let me tell you 'bout
The world and the way things are
You've come from a different place

And I know you've traveled far
Now that you've told me what it is
I'd better point you towards the wiz

He's the wiz, he's the man
He's the only one
Who can give your wish right to ya
He's the wizard

He'll send you back through time
By running magic through ya
All of the super power's his
Listen and I'll tell you where he is

He's the wiz and he lives in Oz
He's the wizard
There's the way to Emerald City
That's not too far, is it?
He's the wizard

Just take your dilemma, child
And lay it on the wizard
He'll fix you a drink
That'll bubble and foam
And in a flash you will be home

He's the wiz, he's the wiz
He's the wizard of Oz
He's got magic up his sleeve
He's the wizard

And you know without his help
It would be impossible to leave
Fantastic powers at his command
And I'm sure that he will understand

He's the wiz and he lives in Oz

Sweet thing, let me tell you 'bout
The world and the way things are
I'm gonna point you towards the wiz

And I'm sure that he will understand

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You,1997

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Thelma Houston,"How many of you people out there
You've been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear
You'll never love again?

How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies and how many fights?
And why would you want to put
Yourself through all that again?

Love is pain, I hear you say
Love has a cruel and a bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith
You ever had in your brain

How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of him smiling at you
When you was still together

You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile
That you've been thinking of all day

Turn the clock to zero, honey
Sell the stock, spend all the money
Starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock all the way back
Wonder if you'll take me back
Thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero, mister
Never never know how much I missed you
Starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day

It can happen to you, just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity, there's no guarantee
I say love is such a force that if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
But baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

Turn the clock to zero, honey
Sell the stock, spend all the money
Starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I'm begging him to take me back
Thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
Starting up a brand new
A brand new, a brand new day

I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm a bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave

You're the plow and I'm the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm a flagpole to your nation

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up, stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up, stand up all you lovers in the world
Starting up a brand new day

I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
I'm the magnet to your pole
I'm the Devil in your soul

You're the pupil, I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower, I'm the rain
You're the tunnel, I'm the train

Stand up, stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up, stand up all you lovers in the world
Starting up a brand new day

You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion

We can turn this ship around
We'll go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle

Stand up, stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up, stand up all you lovers in the world

Thelma Houston,"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
He'll find the note I left hanging on his door
And he'll laugh when he reads the part that says, I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that man so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque, he'll be working
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But he'll just hear that phone, keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma, he'll be sleeping
He'll turn softly and call my name out loud
And he'll cry just to think I'd really leave him
Though time and time, I try to tell him so
Oh, he just didn't know I would really go
I would really go

Please, please baby, think about me sometimes
Think about me here, here in misery, misery

The promises we made, all the daily letters
Then, all of the sudden everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window, sugar, down a lonesome road

Once in a great while
There comes a man that's truly worth waiting for

And though it may take some time to trust
That he really is as great as he seems
And he treats you just like you deserve

And you know?
Just like you're worth all the love he has for you

I can't prove myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you

I still remembering the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming, planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to

Come on in
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
And I just don't wanna stop

A million days in your arms is never too much
And I just don't wanna stop
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)

I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, I can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'

Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you, you make my heart scream and holler

Won't you make them happy before they pass away?

Thelma Pelish,"DORIS DAY: Love, are you nuts?
GIRLS: Some people can't tell when it hits them! 


DORIS:
All you gotta do is say hello to a man
And they've got you whispering in his ear


All you gotta do it seems is work for him
And they've got you going beserk for him


If there's a guy you merely have a bicker with
They've got you setting the wedding date


It seems they've just gotta have some dirt 
To bend your ear with


So before you start, I herewith state..... 


I'm not at all in love, not at all in love, not I
Not a bit, not a mite
Though I'll admit he's quite a hunk o' guy
But he's not my cup o' tea, not my cup o' tea, not he
Not an ounce, not a pinch
He's just an inch too sure of himself for me


GIRL: Well of course you've noticed his manly physique and that look in his eyes
GIRL: Say, I'm sure he can cut most any man down to size
GIRL: He must he as fierce as a tiger when he's mad
GIRL: And I'll bet he cries like a little boy when he's sad


DORIS:
But I'm not at all in love, not at all in love, not I
Not a straw, not a hair
I don't care if he's as strong as a lion
Or if he has the rest of ya sighin'
You may be sold, but this girl ain't buyin'
I'm not at all in love!


GIRLS: She's not at all in love, not at all in love, oh no
DORIS: Not a pin, not a crumb
GIRLS: Must be the summer heat that gives her that glow
'Cos she's not at all in love, not at all in love, she cries
DORIS: Not a snip, not a bite
GIRLS: Must be the light from the ceiling shining there in her eyes


GIRLS: He's young and handsome, and smart, and we can't get over it
DORIS: But this lady's heart he doesn't effect a bit
GIRLS: It's easy to see that her daffy grin is the grin she always wears
And she's breathless because she ran up a flight of stairs

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Prone to be unkind then
Wish they'd turn back time somehow
Then I was audacious
I ignored what was precious
How I wish you'd ask me now

I thought then I'd always be
Footloose and fancy free
How could I have been so blind
What I once made light of turned out to be true love

Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Hold thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

I send an 'Airmail Special' too

Thelonious Monk,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)

Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

Thelonious Monk,"You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1996
Thelonious Monk,"I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

[Chorus]
Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

[Chorus]",Indiana,1997

Placed no one above me

Prone to be unkind then
Wish they'd turn back time somehow

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way

And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly

Thelonious Monk,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2001

Thelonious Monk,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
