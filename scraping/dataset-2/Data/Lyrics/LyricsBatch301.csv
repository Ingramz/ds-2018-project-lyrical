George Maharis,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you",I'll Never Smile Again,2000
George Maharis,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2000
George Maharis,"You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes 
As they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh! You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now 

Does your dad appreciate 
That you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
You're such a treat for the eyes? 

You must have been a beautiful baby,

George Maple,"Touch of your skin, blurring my vision,
Seeing the same film again.
Closer you pull me under the table
Sign of how this might end.

But if you don’t want to hold me,
Maybe I could change your mind
‘Cause I’m waiting, hesitating.
And there’s not a waste to leave you
But I only ask for you
As you move your body next to me
There’s so much more to lose.

When you talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was,
All I wanted was,
All I wanted was your reckless heart

Leaning to kiss you, push me away
Carving my name on the wall.
Words are like weapons, cut through the truth
I won’t remember anything at all.

Maybe I could change your mind

I saw the photograph.

Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

We have already come.

And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1997

With your wings near fire,
But confess when your tire,
Is the candle worth the flame?
Your Queen of the Night
But with morning's early light
There's not a hear to really call your own;
So before it's too late, 
Change your ways and repent,
Take my love that was meant
For black butterfly along.

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Twenty five years living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep
She needs her mother but her mother is dead
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget
Just another hooker
It happens everyday
She loved her little baby
But she couldn't bare to see her living
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

I believe in the gods of America
I believe in the land of the free
But no one told me
(No one told me)
That the gods believe in nothing
So with empty hands I pray
And from day to hopeless day
They still don't see me
(See me)

Everybody talks about the new generation
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation
Like to help you buddy, but I haven't got the time
Somebody shouted save me
And everybody started living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

There's a big white lady
On a big white doorstep
She asked her daddy and her daddy said 'yes'
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get
Has to give a little
They say it's for the best
Somebody shouted
Maybe
But they kept on living from hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

So she ran to the arms of America
And she kissed the powers that be
And someone told me

That the gods believe in nothing
So with empty hands I pray
And I tell myself
One day
They just might see me",Hand to Mouth,1987

George Michael,"You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find
Peace of mind
Til you listen to your heart

People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them
Steal your heart from you
People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart

You are far
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces
And mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to stars
But I'll never find
Peace of mind,
While I listen to my heart

People,
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them
Steal your heart

And people
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all

But remember this
Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you
Like I always do
There's something there
That can't compare with any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too

You must have been kissing a fool",Kissing a Fool [Remastered Version] [Version],1987

I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine

Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us

Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, ohh

Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
I'll be feeling fine, the way you heal me
The way you thrill me, keep me comin' to you
For you to sexually fulfill me

You're my medicine, open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate, baby
I can't wait for you to operate

And baby, when I should be asleep at night
I stay up and read
And baby, baby, baby, I can't help but feel uptight
For my passion needs

And when I get this feeling
I want sexual healing
When I get this feeling
I want sexual healing

Baby, I can't stand it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
Ohh, when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing

And I need sexual healing, darling

If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

I say it could be the price of love
Could the price of hate
What am I guilty of
Why do you make me wait
So long I don't know your intentions
Look to the sky's above
I am in the hands of fate push till it gets to shove
I have got to know for heavens sake
Is this love, (is this love) is this love or invention
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy

Give you all the love that your heart, oh yeah
Give you all the love that your heart
Give you all the love that your heart desires  
(Baby I can't) baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy

I can make you happy if only for a while
Little baby oh, oh little baby
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart  desires
Give you all the love that your heart desires oh yeah
(I'm gonna make you feel so sexy) if only for a while little baby
Oh little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

(You take, you take) you take someones heart and you kick it around
Keep on picking it up
So you can watch it come down
I don't know what I am suppose to do
Why I wait for you to make up your mind
Could you please be so kind
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day (Hmm)

You can't make your heart feel something it won't

I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
And I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes and then I won't see
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then, to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!

No way

What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys at MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show

There's someone I forgot to be

I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind

She takes his hand
And prays the child will understand
At the door they watch the men go by
In the clothes that daddy wore

Mother's pride
Baby boy
His fathers eyes
He's a soldier waiting for war
Time will come
He'll hold a gun
His father's son

And as he grows
He hears the band
Takes the step from boy to man
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye
Like the man she did before

Mother's pride
Just a boy
His country's eyes
He's a soldier waving at the shore
And in her heart the time has come
To lose a son

And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone

No difference in the end
Still hear the woman say your father died a hero

Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say, ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate

Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to every-body
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain

It's that
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay
Send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round
Breaking many hearts
Stop it please
Before it's gone too far

The force of evil plans
To make you its possession
And it will if we let it
Destroy ev-er-why-body
We all must take
Precautionary measures
If love and please you treasure

Would I have to let you go?

I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know ?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame ?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
'Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find - no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah

I was crippled emotionally

I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me
Uh huh

With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes

I wish that we could lose this crowd

That you let me know
So if you love me
Say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh so I don't want to learn
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy

George Michael,"Five o'clock in the morning
You ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
Baby I just want you to know
I won't go through it again
Yes, those clouds are closing in

And I will not accept this as a part of my life
I will not live in fear
Of what may be
And the lessons I have learned
I would rather be alone than watch you
Spinning that wheel for me

You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
One of these days
You're gonna bring some home to me

Six o'clock in the morning
You ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
It seems that everybody takes their chances
These days
Oh yeah we're standing in the rain

And I will not accept this as part of my life

How can you love me
When you are playing with my life
You say give me time and I'll do better I swear

Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I hear the sound of the memory
Maybe time will tell

Suddenly my life is like a river
Taking me places I don't want to go
But like all good men who swim too well
It takes all that I have just to cry for help
Then that voice in my head tells me no

I'm going down 
Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I hear the sound of the memory
Maybe, who can tell ?

Let me live my life beside the river
Take me to places where a child can grow
And then maybe the boy inside will forsake me
Maybe the child in me will just let me go

Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be

Take back your singing in the rain

Is that I don't belong to you

What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be

Don't think that I'll be back again

I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand

Why tell me you don't understand when you do
I thought I had something to say

But it doesn't really matter at all...
I changed my name to be rid of the things that I want from you
It's strange but the name is a name and the truth is a truth

Oh, there is always, always someone there to remind me
So I learn to live with shame
I tell myself I feel no pain
But I do and if I have to tell you

Then it doesn't really matter at all...

Because time is a thief and I believe that I'm too old for that

You heard me cry 
You smiled at me

And Heaven stole

Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all this pain 
I thought I'd never feel the same 
About anyone 
Or anything again 

But now I know 
When you find your love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

Sadness 
In my eyes 
No one guessed 
Or no one tried 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

Loveless and cold 
With your last breath 
You saved my soul 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
And just when it began 
He took you away 

But I still say 
When you find love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 

For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be 
My love

I have had enough of crime
(Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time

That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong, baby

I will be your father figure

Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me

Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes, baby
And love can't lie, no

My love is always tellin' me so

Never had a chance to see him, no
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
My mama just hung her head and said

Yeah, wherever he laid his hat was home
And when he died
All he left us was alone 
Then my mama she said
(Papa was a Rollin' Stone) oh, my mama said

No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee

Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell

And then change that truth into love

And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,1998

George Michael,"The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I've seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way

Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door",The Long and Winding Road,2002
George Michael,"I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal",Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me [Live][*],2002
George Michael,"In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling, we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
Still ahead
Pity me",'39,2002
George Michael,"The grave that they dug him had flowers
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone
He's gone
When the wars of our nation did beckon
A man barely twenty did answer the calling
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation
He's gone
But eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done
And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry
And deep in the trench he waited for hours
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die
But the silence of night was shattered by fire
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there
He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear
""They can't let me die! The can't let me die here!
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave""

A man barely twenty did answer the calling
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation
He's gone",The Grave,2003

Maybe luck is a lady

I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

George Michael,"My mother had a brother
They say that I was born on the day that he died
Someone to cling to, she said
When all the noises and the shame came calling

My mother had a brother
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew
But she lied
I said, ""Show me his face again, tell me again why he died""

She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine

My mother had a brother
Over-sensitive and kind
Seems it all became too much for him.
It seems he took his own life
Mum, I can't imagine the joy and pain in equal measure
Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure

I guess he had to wait until my momma had me
I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free
In endless sky

But mama will you tell him from your boy
The times they changed
I guess the world was getting warmer
And we got stronger
Mother will you tell him about my joy
I live each day for him
The sun came out, yeah, and I'm just breathing it in

My mother had a brother
Same desire, different time
Seems the empty spaces tortured him
Until he took his own life

I don't know why I waited so long for love
I just don't know what I was thinking of
All that wasted time

But mama will you tell him from your boy
The times they changed
I guess the world was getting warmer
While we got stronger
Mother will you tell him about my joy
I live each day with him
Your son came out, yeah,
And I'm still breathing it in

And I swear now that freedom is here
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn
I'm making so much love

So those of us who have nothing to fear
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned
I'm making so much love

I was a prisoner, but he saved me
Broke into my dreams and said, ""Who cares?""

And I don't believe they care.",My Mother Had a Brother,2004

It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe
Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?
Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand
No time for introduction
With all that money changing hands

And the satellite says, ""Take a look at all we have""
But the old man says,
""You want my family, for your liberty, I can't do that.""

Look into the eyes of any patient man
Whether they be amber, green or blue,
There's a piece of God staring back at you
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves
They see our broken women
On imaginary shelves

But the satellite says, ""Won't you people look at all we have?
Don't you want it?

Can't you see the things that you lack?""

George Michael,"In my house there's a circle, where the life comes in
From the stars to my home, down through the stone,
I could have been so alone,
Without my precious box
Have I a family? I guess not
I've never seen a lot of beauty
In my life.

Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim
Such a beautiful home, your agent's on the phone, they never
Leave you alone
The party never stops!
You say that's fantasy, I say ""So what, I need a little
Beauty""

So let me in,
You know you've kind of got under my skin
You know we never see a lot of the action round here
My dear
You may want to strip again

And you look so fine in your Gucci suit
And you're making more money than your daddy
Could have imagined
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time

So take that picture, stop acting so dumb
Don't you know that the moment will come
I will find someone like you
But with something extra, I'm sorry baby
I don't know why
I don't know why that is

The systematic breakdown of my community
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God
There's just never enough
Switch on, the pressure, stops
You know the one for me, she's on Fox
And she's a little beauty

Give me your life, give me your life, I want it
Because lately, it's so freezing out here
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass)
In so many ways, but you make it good
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could
(This side of the glass)

So take that picture, stop acting so dumb
Don't you know that the moment will come
I will find someone like you
But with something extra, I'm so sorry baby
I don't know why
I don't know why that is

Precious keeps me company
Keeps me from being alone

Because no-one comes in the morning
No-one comes in the evening time
I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring
I could be waiting my whole damn life

So sick of the same old faces
In this street, where nobody talks to me
And the funny side of the situation is
I don't care, I'll always be there

When you come down from the sky
And make yourself at home
In my house

Because these days it's the money the money
The money, honey, or your life
I said don't you know you can't have both

Stop acting so dumb
The moment will come
I will find someone like you
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby
I don't know why (something)
Said I don't know why that is

You may want to strip again
You may want to let me in
You may want to sacrifice

You may want to change your mind
You may wish you could turn back time.",Precious Box,2004
George Michael,"My daddy got here on the gravy train
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game
They went walking and she took his name
Round here

There was dancing in the afternoons those days
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same

Frightened little girl, she makes a break
Into the arms of, something better
Round here

I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark
Waiting patiently to make my mark
Round here

And I remember my first day at school
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool
I remember it all, like yesterday

Don't you

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside says, ""You can do better""
Round here

So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
I want to put my hands in this earth again
Music fell like rain to the streets
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat

I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth

When all that I wanted, was to be someone.

Two little Hitlers in an old church hall
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls
Andy says it's time to show them all
Round here

Please sir, we two have other plans
Please sir you would not understand,
What's going on
Is magical, can't you see
That some of us do more than dream

Something inside says, ""Keep on keeping, on and on....""

I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth

In this town,
Yes I guess I got to be someone

To be somebody

How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away.

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it,
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
The sun that didn't shine,
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.

Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you,
But, words won't come for me to speak.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
That didn't fill the sky,
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.

Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,
But, my heart blames it on me.

No sign of life since '75
Then one day he just, what do you know
I guess God just called his number

He called me up he called me up and said
""I've been awake about a week
I'm thinking about asking the doctor
If he could put me back to sleep""
Then he laughed and said
""Hey all the girls they look the same""
Don't they know just what their mothers
Paid in blood, and tears to change

But the words that made me cry
The thing he softly said
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head
He said, ""If Jesus Christ is alive and well
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?""

Youth, beautiful youth
We walked through the walls until we found the truth
And said ""Change it, it's ugly just change it""
Everyone we used to know
Must have given up, so long ago
You can see it, it's written on their faces
And the inside of their clothes

But the words that made me cry
'Cause I knew just what they meant
He turned to me and said
""Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?""

""Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?""

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 

For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be 
My love 

Well, I've been loved 
So I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed 
Is always by my side

George Michael,"Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
May your every New Year dream come true

Sweet December song
The melody that saved me
On those less than Silent Nights
When snow would fall upon my bed
Like sugar from Jesus
And take me to the day
She could always smile
The Virgin Child would always show you see
Just to save me (just to save me)
There was always Christmas time
To wipe the year away
I guess that Mum and Dad decided
That the war would have to wait
 
There was always Christmas time
Jesus came to stay
I could believe in peace on Earth
And I could watch TV all day
So I dreamed of Christmas

Maybe since you've gone
I went a little crazy
God knows they can see the child

But the snow that falls upon my bed
That loving I needed
Falls every single day
For each and every child
The Virgin smiles for all to see
But you kept her from me

There was always Christmas time
To wipe the year away
I guess that Mum and Dad decided
That the war would have to wait

There was always Christmas time
Jesus came to stay
I could believe in peace on Earth
And I could watch TV all day
So I dreamed of Christmas
Yes, I dreamed like you

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
May your every New Year dream come true",December Song (I Dreamed of Christmas),2010
George Michael,"On the floating, ship-less, oceans
I did all my best to smile
Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving into your eyes.
And you sang ""Sail to me, sail to me,
Let me enfold you.""
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you.

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was full sail?
Now my foolish boat is leaning,
Broken lovelorn on your rocks.
For you sang ""Touch me not, touch me not,
Come back tomorrow.""
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow.

I'm as puzzled as a newborn child.
I'm as riddled as the tide.
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or shall I lie with death my bride?
Here me sing: ""Swim to me, swim to me,
Let me enfold you.""

Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you",Song to the Siren,2012
George Michael,"I’m back
I’m back
Prouder than ever baby
Louder than ever maybe
One more pill
Just one more beer one less star
In the atmosphere for us
But maybe she just wanted to be free
Heartless pictures on TV
Change that channel
That could have been me I said
Maybe she just wanted to be free

I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no

With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment, no, I don't

Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons

But don't bet them
They can't take him
To the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I want to watch them

'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
Oh he's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before

He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized in the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes

But don't pretend
That it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share

Oh he's not the same no more

No sign of life since '75

I' guessing God just called his number

He called me up he called me up and said
""I've been awake about a week
I'm thinking about asking the doctor
If he could put me back to sleep""
Then he laughed and said
""Hey all the girls they look the same""
Don't they know just what their mothers
Paid in blood, and tears to change

But the words that made me cry
The thing he softly said
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head
He said, ""If Jesus Christ is alive and well
And how come John and Elvis are dead?""

Youth, beautiful youth
We walked through the walls until we found the truth
And said ""Change it, it's ugly just change it""
Everyone we used to know
Must have given up, so long ago
You can see it, it's written on their faces
And the inside of their clothes

But the words that made me cry
'Cause I knew just what they meant
He turned to me and said
""Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?""

""Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?""

Past the school that has not changed
In all this time

All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only god knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms 
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose

So if it's god who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, she said

But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And I'll be fine (and I'll be fine)
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use in pressing palms

It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove
And heaven help the ones who wait for you

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm

George Mileson,"In my dream our love was lost, I lived by luck and fate
I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late
Now I'm standin' on this empty road where nothin' moves but the wind

Once I was your treasure and I saw your face in every star
But the promises we make at night, oh that's all they are
Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as the howlin' wind
And honey I just want to be back in your arms
Back in your arms again

You came to me with love and kindness
But all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness
I met you with indifference and I don't know why

George Mileson,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard

Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss

One, two, three, four

Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul

We're gonna get to that place

I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done

Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us

I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man

Oh, your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way
There's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

George Mraz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2009
George Mraz,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Bring happy times

Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Give me her name
But who would have thought I would be crying here
With all this pain no no


Hold me close one more night baby
Hold me close one more time (just give me one more time my baby)
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

Now there's nothing I can do and
There's nothing I can say
About losing you
I wish that I could find a way, wish that I could see you again
If only I could turn back time

Hold me close one more night...
Hold me close one more time.. 
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside (dying on the inside)
A butterfly....

George Nozuka,"Can't Stop Loving You Lyrics
Artist: George Nozuka


Since you let me go
Every single day seems impossible
Just can't get you out of my mind
Everything I see brings back memories
Of you and me
Left me on my knees
Even though its been hell
I'm still begging please
And I really just wanna why

babe if you're home please pick up the phone
'cause I'm incomplete.. without you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up

I know you hate girl
And I know you're only doing this to
Hurt me, girl, and I'm dying inside
Tonight, I got no other choice, I need to hear your voice
To get goodbye,
If were meant to be just thought I should be happy
And I'm saying it straight from the phone
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
Guess it is what it is I..

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you (cant stop, can't can't stop)
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up loving you

there's are times I don't know what I'm suppose to do
'cause I don't like to be alone (don?t like to be alone)
Lookin at all the pictures that I have of you
I'm listening to sad love songs
Where will I go, what will I do
Who will I be if I can't be with you
Here I stand, half a man
And I'm givng my all in my hand

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
(cant loving you, can't stop loving you)
'cause I'm all torn up baby and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up loving you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up 
(all torn up, can't give up)
(all torn up, can't give up)

George Nozuka,"In the middle of the night,
No one heard the boy
Who cried himself to sleep
Didn't care about himself 'cause he
Hurt too much, he was hurt too much
And the burden of the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,
Hurting child
I sing for the hurting child
I sing for the hurting child

In the middle of the fight
No one saw the girl who thought it
Was her fault, didn't know about her pain
Though it was right there
No one said they cared
And the burden of the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,
Hurting child
I sing for the hurting child

I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Cry for the children now
So I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Smile for the children now
Said the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,
Hurting child
I sing for the hurting child

I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Cry for the children now
So I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Smile for the children

George Nozuka,"I'll tell you all something man
This girl man
I used to love we was together
She left, She with this other guy
Its really blowing my mind right now
George man I gotta tell you about it

I was up in the VIP section
I've seen her with her girlfriends dancin'
With her tight blue jeans and stilettos on
I thought about our last convo on the telephone
And I said girl I'm going on a tour
I'll be gone for 4 months
So why don't we just break it on off for 4 months
She said boy if you leave you so nuts
'Cause Imma just move on
And you gonna be so crushed

Never thought I'd bump into you
With another guy under your arm
Now I know that I was a fool
Fool of my girl, fool of my girl
The whole time that you were with me
My friends said I did you wrong
And now it's easy to see
It just took too long

That was the last time
'Cause the last time
I said goodbye to you
(said goodbye to you)

You may scroll down and join the discussion
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time

You keep on blocking my calls
So now I know how it feels
And it hurts
What goes around comes around
The pain is so real
I see you two so happy
Don't know what to do (Oh)
I'm lost without you (Nooo)

It was the last time
'Cause the last time (Ohhh)
Don't wanna say goodbye (say goodbye)
Don't wanna say goodbye to you

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time

Jeah, momma said
Boy she with a keeper
But now I understand
Why I'm sick with a fever
That's why I run around
With the models and divas
Drinkin' away the pain
With the henni and tequila
If I could take it all back I would
I'd take it back to the days
Where our love was all good
When I used to have you
On the bed, legs spread
Instead, I'm listening to the words you always said

On the real
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
How I feel
Don't you know that your the only one
Last time,
I took you for granted
When you were mine
Please forget about the last time
Let's talk

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
Last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth

There she is in the club on a Friday night, 
With her back against the wall,
Somethin' about this girl I can't describe
But I know that I want it
In a crowded room she stands alone 
With her back against the wall 
Biggest eyes I've ever known
Yeahh
She knows that I'm watching 
She's right were I'm walking
Every five minutes Its the second yeahh
She knows what I'm doing its no mystery to her

There's that girl with the soft as sweet 
Just like sugar and she's higher then me 
Somethings going down that somethin' somethin' now 
There's that girl with the softest smile 
Ain't gonna stop till the somethin's mine
Stand up baby please
And drop the somethin' somethin' on me
Drop your pants if you feel right 
Because you know were going to rock through the whole night
Drop your pants if you feel right
Does it feel right
You...
Gotta see this girl with your one two eyes
With her back up against the wall
Its the way she moves from side to side 
She's got me hipnotized
Its hard to focice 
Not to notice
When her backs up against the wall
She's all up onto me
Yeahh you know that's cool with me

Before the club we're hanging out until this girl walked in
Caught me by surprise when she didn't say hello
Had an attitude, why be so rude I know just what to do
Pulled the girl aside and politely gave my name
Told the girl don't act this way
I see right through your game
What he did was such a shame
Don't be living with his pain

So let it go tonight
I see the beauty within your eyes
So let it go tonight

Oh sing me to sleep,

Over the hills there is a way I know it, over the hills

You can't bring all the gloom
(Your heart is frayed and so empty)
You glorify the future
(Living in a different world than me)

The journey ends in death
(You are giving up so easily)
You are the other half of me

Over the hills, over the hills
Over the hills, over the hills

We are drifting apart
(Chilled to the marrow 'cause you don't want to go)
'Cause we've got a different wish at heart
(The amulet guides us to the other side)

When I go down it's you who'll bleed
(I'm not scared to die, as long as I'm with you)

Over the hills there is a way I know it, over the hills

Becomes of the contemptible

Closest to pure perfection

The chain of strength it holds

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

I know the croaking chorus from the Frogs of Aristophanes,
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.

Then I can write a washing bill in Balylonic cuneiform,
And tell you every detail of Caractacus's uniform;

When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,
And when I know precisely what is meant by ""commissariat"",

When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery:

Truth and life and what love means, my son
Remember, you said you'd always believe

When will you remember
Call my name, I'll come

From near or far to where you are
You'll find me there from anywhere

You will be heard

Say the word
And I will be with you
Until forever is only the beginning

It doesn't matter that you walked out on us
I don't care about what, when, where, why or who
It doesn't matter what you've said or done
You thought you'd run like everyone

And do the stuff they said was fun
To me that could never be an issue
You never have to wonder if or when my love will end

'Cause I will always be here
Waiting for you

From near or far to where you are
You'll find me there from anywhere
With no restraint just whisper faint
You will be heard

And I will be with you
Until forever is only the beginning

Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is

I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me

Without you life will never begin to be

George Shearing,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

George Shearing,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

George Shearing,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

George Shearing,"What is so rare as a day in June?
'Till now we have never been told
The old question's answered by one that is new
What is so rare, dear, as you?
 
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me

George Shearing,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,

Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak

And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!
