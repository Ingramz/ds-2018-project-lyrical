Lil Mama,"[Chorus:]
In the mirror I'm lookin' at the shadow
If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep fallin' from my heart
In the mirror I'm lookin' at the shadow
If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my mind
Broken pieces keep fallin' from my heart
Cause I know what I'm feeling
And I know what is real
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep fallin' from my heart

[Verse 1:]
Everyday when I wake up
I wanna see yo face and I
Realize that you'll never apologize
For yo lies and all the ways you hurt me
And I know in my mind that you ain't worthy
But when I look in the mirror
I see this girl who keeps cryin' she's cryin'
She still in love with you
But I tell not to cause she's wildin' she's wildin'
I don't know what she's thinkin' about
Get it together or I'm gettin' you out
Of the mirror
I'm gettin' you outta my system
My vision premonition
And I listen to my answers
And free my soul from prison

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My patience a plastic bag
And he kept fillin' it
Carryin' baggage of others
Is where I emptied it
Played the fool before
I'm not about to let you enter
My mind for my heart draws the bigger picture
His presence embrace me
His lovin' so greatly
I miss the way we
Use to sit up all night
And talk about nothin'
On the phone
Please how could you be so weak
When you know you deserve so much better
And rather than settle for less
Just let the best play catch up
When the time is right they'll find you
If you choose to
Do not do
The best I could do
Is warn and inform you
The mirror

Lil Mama,"[Random Talking]

Random person: What does the voice of the young people mean?

Lil Mama: ""It might not mean something to someone else but it means a lot to me""
""If y'all see eye to eye, you have something to accomplish""
""I don' think that parents should sugar coat information from kids because you're going to get it raw in the streets anyways""
""So VYP, to me is just sharing that voice, that real voice of life experiences, covering the youth and me, and there is a youth in everybody""
""I'm keeping it strictly 100 % real""",Intro,2007
Lil Mama,"[Chorus]
L-is for the liars that had surrounded me
I-insecurity, My head down in these streets
F-my future, there isn't one
E-ternal Hope and this is my life

[Verse 1]
I wake up everyday to the same ole' foster motha
I ain't got no pictures of my mother
She was a crack fiend, nothin' like Pac-mother
She didn't make a difference
Even doe she could've Momma
Shame, shame on my life
Popa tried to sell me twice
On the stop by
Look in my eyes, bags from the tears that I cried
And the people who lied
Telling me that this was my place
Fony tried to smile in my face
But I shoulda knew somethin' was rare
Smile on her face when she open the mail
Kept a nice mink on her back
Meanwhile I gotta goose and my gooses got patches
I'm so mad, this is me
I'm so hurt, this is me
So why should it be, but I'ma be alright

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm pregnate by a dude and he's not 16
But, I like his style, his whip is mean
Momma told me to find a man to take care of me
And he does buy me things but he beats on me
I come to her for a little advice
She told her... Up
with a black eye, Telling me to know my place
So, I stay, wait for my body phase
Telling myself that its just a pregnancy phase
When all, in reality I'm being discouraged, and disrespected, and under depression
And i don't really blame the man
I blame my mother for not teachin' me the different types of man
Life neva understood its stand
My side of the story being that it's so consistent
18 yrs and 9months developing raisin' in prison I guess I'll neva make a difference

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
On,ON from a nothing to Orphans, the least of my problems
Appears like Deja Vu, stomach starvin'
Free lunch, breakfast, evenly i departed
Ao ashamed of a life that was started
Ask God if, he could take the pain away
He made me in denile of every word I pray
Everyday it's the same old no talent
I'm feelin' like my life is unbalanced
No tellin', what tomorrow gonna look like, yea rite
Wrapped up in a fast light for suicide act
Why, is my life set up for failure ya'll
I can care less what the people say to ya'll
We break out in rage, ventin' all the hurt inside
Who am i, to tell you what u failed 2 realize
The voice that you hold within you, the voice that you are, the voice of the young people

Come around my way

I'm from a place in Harlem
Where the streets they look like Africa
And the trees are in better condition than the homes so abandoned
P S 197
Where I study my academic stare run
And the books so worn and torn I can't think
How they tried to cripple me
Understood the lost side of me
Thank god I had a good teacher on the side of me
Showed me the right things to do
Overcame these obstacles
Haters stand up for the things that we've been through ooh

[Chorus]

Here we got these buildings called projects but they ain't three stories
They fill about ten on the block April flow go up by twenty
Stories I tell be true story kids cut school and watch Maury
Like if they ain't intellect in what's affecting my life I can't respect them
But that's just they way of the ghetto
People who come from where I'm from get it
But we still gotta make a difference
Stand up tall so the world can get it
Teach kids pride instead of ""Outside""
Show another side and they show goin' rise
Stop letting responsibility fall
I can tell you ain't been around my way at all

Why don't you come around(way)
So you can see what my(way)
Eyes been seeing why(way)
Why don't you come around
Where we need directions(way)
Respect in every lesson(way)
Way, why don't you come around

Straight out of the ocean I was raised in the water
Find my way to swim shore to the boy with two legs me I'm a mermaid
Different lifestyles and?
He wanna swim...
And I don't mind that
But I don't know if can keep up with where I'm at
I'm surrounded by sharks and they all bite
And quick to attack if they sense what they don't like like
He can't swim with me
Cause if I walk with him
He gon' still my speed so I can't talk to him
But if he keep up and fight through the waves
Fight through the pressure and the gust of your days
Test water with toes and dive in brave
You better follow your nose cause I'm so hey hey
Hard to catch up with so he can't fit
Threw his life jacket on and still can't catch this

More money, more money
More shine
She the princess of the city
I'm her son boy shine
Top the dime
Shorty got cake like (uh)
Duncan Hines, come on G-slide

They be callin me T in the hood
'Cause I bring the pain daddy
And when it's time to hold it down
I make it rain daddy
And then you got to feel me
'Cause I might make it flood
And if you G-slide slow
You better pick it up
G-slide with me
Be shy do it
See shorty lookin over from the side viewin'

And show him how to do it
Slide right, slide left
Take ya time (do it)

Lil mama get it poppin' (yeah)
Stand on the streets so the people yell
Just lookin' at me like

And my heart for none of you girls
I bet you girls live no losses
I switch verses like sauces
That prego sauce be poppin'
She so hot
When I bubble I'm down to pop
And if you tip and try to touch
You might end up with red spots
When it's hot, then it's hot
If it ain't, then it's not
No wait, you won't convert
This numero uno spot
'Cause I spot little creatures trying to turn beast
Go feast (feast)
They like the terriers, I'm red meat (meat)
And it's no way they can see me (No)
WHile I do it for tv (Yes)

Are ya gon' play it? Are ya gon' move? 
The party ain't gon' start if ya don't dance 
I don't care if you lead, but you still be my man 
I don't get mad over silly pettiness 
I say to hell with it, say oh advocate 
Timbaland is known watch him make ya move ya feet 
Make dope beats, rhyming a song so unique 
His beats are like shine, aren't cha, and the cast is true 
Ya need the same identity, define how he soars

Call him Timbaland the resurrection

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk

We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

We got too much money, too much cash

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

I got my name on a candy blimp, I got a drop top six on chrome rims

I got cash like Baby and Slim, but I'm a juvenile with a lot of gems
And I'm still a baby gangsta, with a AK and a nine double M
I'm Lil' Flip and I'm living lavish, I got a lot of homeboys that live in Dallas
I got partnas in Kansas City, I got partnas that gangbang down in Cali

I got hoes that be tossing salad, I got hoes that steal out shopping malls

My blades gon' chop and my pop trunk low
I chill wit my boys I might ride tan
I'ma H-town playa and ya'll can't stand me!
When I'm at school I make good grades
Ya know I'm Sucka Free and we all playa made
Chop chop twist twist I got rocks on my wrist
I'ma million dollar balla wit a million dollar kiss

[Verse Three: Lil' Flip]
Well...
I got rocks on my wrist head lights on my fist
Wit all dis platinum in my mouth playboy I'm da shit!
I gotta Bourbon, a Jag, and one Durango
If you lookin at my watch you might see a rainbow
And when I pull up on da scene I'm hangin out da sunroof
Fo' 15's in my trunk kick like kungfoo (hhhuuwwwhhhaaii!)
You say you ballin like me what you gun' do
What you got on yo' watch I got on one tooth
I like to spend 50 and ball in da mall
Go to Gavleston and crawl on da wall
Me & Duke spend money and roll on 3's
I spend money like it grows on trees!

[Verse Four: Taz]
If you ain't a millionare you can't ball wit me
Girl if you ain't a star you can't get caught wit me
Ain't nobody gon' represent the south like me
Ain't nobody got rocks in they mouth like me
I'ma shine no matter what the cost
Maybe I'm da boss nobody play the flaught wit me
You claim you ballin hard you ain't spendin G's
We only roll 20-inches on our Bentley's
T-A-Z ballin is what you hate ta say
Twenty D's in my rang can you pay da fee
Wit out money I don't know how my day would be
It's Hill Wood puttin it down playa we Sucka Free, that's right!

[Chorus 4X: Lil' Flip]
Everyday I'm ballin (ooohh da way y'all ball)

[Verse Five: Lil' Flip]
Look everybody in my click got Ninja bikes

And you always stood by my side
And I'm sorry I never told you
If I love you or whatever but
This song's for you

When I look into your eyes
It makes me feel real good
It's like mija now you wonder why
This crazy love will never die
We can find any  ?  Damn right you'll Still be forever mine
I'll wipe those lil tears from your eyes
Please don't cry with only you will stand beside me
When I was torzido you were the only one there for me
I thank you for your time and your love
Damn you mean so much to
And there's no other hyna in this world to take me away from you
This I know its true you're my love bird
And without you I'm through
So I wrote this song  just to let you know what you mean to me
Me & you
You & me
Fulfilling each others fantasies
This will never die
I'll promise I'll stand beside you
Forever I love you baby
Forever mine

Oh you still don't believe me
Mija I told you I'll be there for you don't worry
I don't gotta have to... You know
I don't have to show it to you  every single time
You know what I mean
But just know that I do love you baby
You know what I mean
At night I always look up to the stars you know  what I'm sayin
There beautiful... But you know what there not as beautiful as
You

Till death do us part thrill me with all of your charge
You're my latin queen never leave you lonely
You mean so much to me
When we make love we make all the birds
Forget the bad things only the good times we share
Can make us happy
why mija tu sabes whenever you need me I'm here I'm not
Like those other vatos who left you alone
I won't disappear
Tu eres mi mami, mi angel, mi amor
why tus besos bienen with sabor
Baby don't think I'm only trying to waste your time
Your nombre is on mente till the end of time
Forever mine

So tell me what's on your mind now mija
Now... you know I love you right?
And like I said I'm sorry for not telling you before
But I know you knew
Know what I mean
I know there's gonna be like a lot of ... 
A lot of trouble in our relationship
But I promise you one thing
No matter what I'll never let you down

Them broads try to fuck i'll get that bitch

And when I hop out in a bentley then its got to hurt
I drop the top on you boys until the dances shirt

What you know about going over seas main
Blowing trees and the bricks pushing v's main

You got to love it Ipushed and shoved it just to get in the doe

To the boys talking bout you gon wet Lil' O
So I ain't playin games no moe
And that's for real

[Chorus]
Verse 2 [Big Moe]
As I sank back to the days of struggle
Life has been tussle but I always had a hussle
Sippin gallons of tussen Ain't no time for discussion
All theses hatas mad cause they gals be lusting 
And my gator on buttons popped up blowing doz{doza}
Foe foe in my lap make her drop and hit the floor

Verse 3 [H.A.W.K.]
Back Back playa raise up off me
Shit that a stick is hotter than a cup of coffee
Your mistakes a cost me when you messing with my stash
Sixteen[16] get crush if we're on the same track
How you feel about that it's not fiction or fact 
When I add or subtract comes back plus tax
Your minor setback leads to major combat
Improper contact leads to mortal combat
Hole in your starter hat and your skull gets cracked
Now I walked all on you like you're a doormat
Two hataz I break half squash why'all chit chat
If your patna is real he'll never turn his back
I know this for a format add needs to teachings
Mess with my stash and you gon be a quadrule preaching
You better believe it don't mess with my fade
Or you gon to feel the wrath of the H.A.W.K.

Lil O,"(Lil' O talking)
Say girl, I'm just here to let you know whatever you need
I got you, youknowI'msaying
And that ain't because I'm a trick
That's just because through all the hard times you stayed down for a player
YouknowI'msaying, so I got to respect you for the queen you are
YouknowI'msaying, and I'ma treat you like a shining star
That's for real, coming from Lil' O

[Lil' O]
I'm thinking about the hard times I had boo
Like when I had to borrow change I had to ask you
See when a player had nothing I still had you
And you stayed down and it wasn't cause you had to
That's why I'm glad to, buy you things like diamond rings
Take you to the market to design your jeans
Expose your whole world to the finer things
Or put you in a drop benz sticky lime green
And that's all because you ain't do no popping
Girls hate you like bad food I got this bar rocking
But fuck them broads tell them we goin shopping
And when they see you 'sachi'd down, don't start jocking
See when I was down, where was my pals
They didn't come around it was me and my gal
That's why I don't hang it cats, niggas play it foul
But for you, I'll do anything just ask, that's my style

(Chorus: Lil' O & (Big Moe)
So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You want to chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Big Moe]
When the going got tough, you got tough with me
Through the thick and thin you stuck with me
And even though we're not living in luxury
Stay bubbled a player to come up with me
And I remember all my days in jail
Running my business from outside my cell
Look in my kitchen and try to use my scale
You even caught a case trying to make my bail
I don't want another woman cause you're all I need
When I post up my script you break down in greed
And I always appreciate your love
You even let me run the streets with my thugs
Even went to hit the streets with my drugs
Penitentiary chances, anything you need
Baby I can provide, all of these circumstances

(Chorus)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You want to chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Dirty $]
From the start you were my one trusted, much repect
It's amazing how we connect, I'd be a fool to neglect you
I'd do whatever it takes to protect you
If you ever need me call and I'll be there in a sec., boo
When I was flat on my ass you gave me your last
When your people talk trash, you take it in stride
And just reply with a laugh, this hater on enhanced
Still thinking that a player spitting game trying to stab
Trying to slam couldn't create demonstrate between you and me
Now my glass half full no longer half empty
Boys envy, chicks just might tempt me
But I see, his and her plates on bentleys and jewels
In our future, tell me baby boo does this prada suit you
Then pack your shoe, till the virign not last
Anything you want, I'll do it cause of the past

(Chorus)
So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)

[Verse 1]
Hey here's a little story 'bout a nigga like me
I fuck bad broads live large and drive V's
Some say I'm cocky and rude I might be
But nigga fuck you, you ain't got to like me
I'm at the bar taking sips of long island ice tea
Wrist looking' blue or icy I'm pricey
Bitch niggas mean mugging' and starin' all shiesty
Don't make me pepper spray your face have you lookin' all spicy
Cause I know you niggas hatin' and want to fight me
Thinking I'm all Hollywood like Spike Lee
Thinking I'ma steal you and fuck up your white T
When I catch you in your jaw I'ma fuck up your white teeth
But nigga I be ready to scuffle like dice peat
And ya'll walkin' outta this tussle ain't likely
I hope you boys ready to rumble I'm quite deep
And I ain't friendly but I'ma tell you politely

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Say I'm the type of cat  when I pull up in the place
you hatas like a blow job put it in they face
I buy the goochie shoes matching belt lookin' great
Dubs sounding cool you can tell I'm pushin' weights
Courtier full of flakes snow storms in the peaks
Hoe taming nigga keep my bitch on a leash
You the typa cat that'll chase a chick for weeks
Then try to box a nigga when you hear he hit your freak
But playa don't you know you outta line that shit is weak
And fightin' over broads will get you killed up in these streets
You running round here plexin' always thinking shit is sweet
Then have the nerve to wonder why them bullets hit ya cheek
Then want to step to me talkin' but (Oh you foul!)
All up in my face talking bout (You hit my gal)!
I'm looking at him stupid like man this shit is wild
You better give me space asshole I ain't ya pal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I keep my game on face when I'm riding on chops
Straight gorilla pimp don't even wave to the bops
Lookin' like a snail crawlin' slow through the lot
Fist full of grain other hand on the glock
Cause when you want fee jackers want what you got
That's why I stay ready with the inferred dot
The first one to jump is the first getting shot
Put the beam on his head then I take off his block
You love to rob O like take off you rocks
Take off your shoes playa take off your socks
But I'm the type of cat before I take off my watch
Aim at your chest and try to take off you heart
You know how I do playa shake off tha marks
Hit him with the big guns that take off a part
Chest lookin' like he been ate by a shark
Bitch you better mind stay in line play it smart

How many 19 years old got this much ice
How many 19 years old ride around this nice
Not too many I used to get treated like a penny
Now cars closing doors I got plenty
I ain't broke no moe

[Chorus 2]

[Verse Three: Lil O]
I hit the scene coupe lit with screens
Twenty inches sitting on a six machine
Hop out super clean like Listerine
From my wrist and ring I'm glistening
And the way my chain glow u can't miss a thing.
I told you I'll come up you wasn't listening
From the jump I had a dream like Mr. King
That I would hit motto cock till its blistering
You can lick my thing freak me in ways that sickening
They licking my ass til its blittering
They thinking I'm a trick you can't hit your thing
Girl you tripping I kick broads out my car tell them get the stepping
When they try to jump fraud like Pippen
Yeah I fell but I'm back I bled my block from a rock to a chicken
Yeah on my note baby no more slipping
Its going down

H-Town niggas stay paper-chase-on 
All that ""What's up kinfolk"", we ain't no relation
I got my dough, you want to play you get a game station

The fat rat with the cheddar
When I blast my Barretta, slugs smash through your sweater
And if you come, I'm show you if I mash it's whatever
I spin a nigga hot and turn his ass into leather
Two bricks in the dash, fifty g's in the fender
Throw stash spot from my glock, I call it blender

You know when Fat Rat hit the club I always ride through stuntin'
There's somethin' big and wide, and it's glidin' on buttons
'Cause the wool lookin' phat my insides like a glutton
And I don't say hi to these hoes that ain't fuckin'
And if you want to check, go head and try it ain't nothin'
There's killers on my side, just dyin' to spray somethin'
Paint somethin' wrap up the tape somethin'
That's what happened to the last niggas came through frontin'
Now I'm in the field arms in the Lexus
In the bitch like they mommas keep they heads put away
Every soldier on my team all about gettin' cake
And the ones get out of line, we do 'em to set 'em straight
Now it's the thug ones (yeah) who snatch your loved ones (yeah)
And call you for the ransom we want it in all ones (for real)
Debatin', we all dunns (get money)
Them niggas alright, but me, I'm awesome

I'm still a vida-loca (yeah) slangin' coke-a (yeah)
Block leadin', tryna get money like Op-rah (whoa)
In the kitchen cookin' these chickens like okra
I can get it raw, white, yellow, tan, or moca (for real)
Ain't no game is over, it's just a lot of new heads
Now a niggas winnin' wars, giving game to the Feds
That's the type that cats that get found with a brain full of lead
In the living room, tied up and gagged, laying in red
Laying and dead, 'cause playa if you mention-my-name
I will break, every bone and every inch-of-your-frame (what)
When I throw you off the roof and have you wrenchin' in pain 
There's nothin' in the world like the stench of remains, 
'Cause when I throw ?em I don't play no elementary games 
Not when he drunk, ice grill, catching a flame 
He could bust, anything, tryna get at my change
I got the streets on lock like penitentiaries, man, I'm the

Nigga, Nigga, Nigga that's me! (That Mike D!)
On the trill you dummies!
Froze up the whole block on dots and a hummy
Young mommies want a hog that ain't cuffing the puttee

They want a jigga with figures sittin' swole with them goodies
So follow me now to the land of the brick lick hitters
Go getters and wig splitters and a little game that gives shivers
Playboy how you figure you can step to a hog

Let off a hundred rounds drums punishing you and yo dogs
My platoon issue wounds that don't heal up
Nigga when the Mack-9 reel up you better throw your shield up
We dope runners and cake runners 

All out big head hunters three glots and sixin it off the chain young stunners
Better slow down lil daddy before you fuck around and get pegged
Run you off like a scared dog with your tail between your legs 
want to be a baller when this G-shit go down
This my time when I clown that yo click out in one rhyme

[H.A.W.K]
I'm a outlaw (outlaw)
I'll bring it to you raw
Southpaw (southpaw) bone knuckles to the jaw
Above the law and all military forces

A hustler run the block like obstacle courses
I stand taller than Sasquatch
Rolex my wrist watch
And when the gloat cock it's strictly head shots

If a nigga got beef I knock out teeth
Steal you like a thief make the asswhippin' brief
Bring your family grief if the situation is getting sticky
My trigger fingers itchy cause my business is risky

You better not miss me (don't miss me)
Or you ass is history (Bye-bye!)
Yella tape the lot on an unsolved mystery
I can't deny pull more stunts than fog eye

Snitch and you'll die like bacon you will fry
My alibi ""I wasen't even on the scene""
But bullet shells left a trail from the M-16

[Chris Ward]
I'm one of the ones (that's me)
That's an usual suspect
A thug that hang on an infested drug set
And stack chips, stay strap and pack clips

With hollow tips that will make you niggas do backflips
And If we go toe to toe I'll break your jaw
In three or four places like I break the law
Ghetto dope man yellow stone smokes man

Got killers and dealers on my team from here to Oakland
That's movin' more powder than Johnson and Johnson
I'm a death wish to niggas just like Charles Bronson
I'm uncut and lethal like LSD

Cocaine mixed with acid and PCP
Rap game assassin 
If I raise I blast and bury niggas six feet deep in the grass
So if anybody ask
Tell Chris Ward is dangerous

It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him
Bury him, I know one day they gotta bury him
But I lock my casket tight baby so I don't let the devil in
N****, it's just me and my guitar
Yea, b**** I'm heavy metal-ing
You can get to f***in' Led Zeppelin
N****s is b****es, b****es, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court, take your life for the settlement
Yes, I'm the best. and no I ain't positive, I'm definite

And I stay on my flow and Cash Money like a rug
Tied to the f***in' Birdman like a log
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a billion
Cash Money million, hier to the throne
Going at the head is like hair and a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the stone
Knowin' I might get through it like hair and a comb
Know money over b****es, my n****s trust my sisters
And I will take or trash it with the lord as my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

I'm a monster I tell you monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
F*** with me, I will peel like the house's pain
Let's go, n****s don't see me cause I'm better than both

I'ma maintain, all about fortune, not the fame
Feddy, cold cash and a diamond ring, it's all about feddy when I
Rap sing
I'm sick of this struggling all damn day
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray
This for the little kids that can't go play
Cause everybody outside playing with an AK
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost
Better not set trip, fuck around get tossed 
I be a fool with that break them off 
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off
Yeah I'm living a sin when against the grain
You don't know Z-Ro you don't know my pain
Tears be coming on down like rain
It's a full time job, trying to maintain
Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with
Dreams and hopes
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from
Songs I wrote
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill
My shoes
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill 
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way

But one of these days gone be out there
It's a bitch took a ball, ball and parlay
Until we make it we mash together
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together
South sive for live, S.U.C. for life, nigga we get cash forever

(Chorus - 2x)
Maintaining, hustling struggling but I got to survive
Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying
Alive

I'm a real hustler stacking funds, riding around with a loaded
Gun

Some of my niggas that's on the run, with all that weed up in
Your lungs
Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em
Spread
Me and my niggas we break bread, until the whole family's fed
You heard what, I said, in this, over bull
All that, I say, I speak, the truth

Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never
Did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime, and I know I'm wrong, but I
Got to get mine
Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay
Broke
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when
She come home
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome 
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick
Give me a couple of zeros on a check
I might sweat, but never gone let up

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.

I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates

I didn't know why
You didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings
And I missed you, but what we talked through
All them grown folk things, separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show
Because you loved me enormously
And so much more then to say

Lil Rob,"I want you to sit back, close your eyes
And think about all those wonderful times that we used to have here
Now I know things aren't the way they use to be right now
But they are going to get better some day
And I know that

Ever since I was about 12 that's when they documented me
A gang member let me tell you my autobiography
Ay I can't let it to be frenetic, it must have been genetic
To get in trouble with the law take when I break
I'm strapped from the balls that's what I use to do
Smoking a joint or two Lil' Rob getting a little blaze
Welcome to my concrete maze, remember the days
I remember going to school, we meet by the track smoking a sack
With the vato I sold it too, get him stoned
Then I jack it back, remember the guero use to look at us all
Funny and strange, cause my pants was bigger then theirs
But now they all wear them the same
I used to get jealous, wondering why I didn't have the same rights
Is it because I'm running up and down, eating Menudo, frijoles and rice?
Someone explain to me, all of this insanity
I'm not understanding you, never understanding me
When a minority, gets their priorities straight
We become the majority, inflate
Incredible rate, controlling our fate
Controlling our states, and I can't wait
Remember you told me I would never amount to anything
That I'll probably be on the streets sellin mota or methamphetamines
So what? It made me an extra buck when I was shit outta my life
You'd do the same thing homie if you were stuck

And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

And I remember!
Remembering the things we used to do
The places we used to go

And I remember kicking under the street lamps, smokin a J
Hearing my Homie say, Homie pass the joint this way
And this was everyday and every night was the same
We didn't call each other by our first or last, but by nicknames
Dreamer, Peewee, Oso Negro to name a few
One passed away, rest in peace
The others locked away in prison blues
One of the things we use to do
Can't nobody take it away from us
We used to live life dangerous, time flew away like angel dust
Never known as presentado levas
Stay away from metiches, and chepas
Talking mentiras, cause they can't beat us
Mira Lil' Rob on his lowrider bicicleta
Looking for muñecas, beautiful like aztecas
But when it comes to love, before the agony for the ecstacy
What comes around goes around
So baby don't mess with me don't be testing me
Cause Lil' Rob be one of a kind original individual
Unforgettable memorable indelible incredible inferable

And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

And I remember!
Remembering the things we used to do
The places we used to go

Give all of my love to mi madre padre brother and sister
And all of my sangre
Enemies? Chale me vale verga estas afuera mirando padentro
You wanna come in but you can't
Cause we're not in love with no mensos
Figuring it out like a pencil
Treat one like a stencil
Just when you think you've got a grip on life
That's when you let go, ready set go
It's a race to the finish and only the best gonna win this
And I'm prepared to take it to outer limits or until it's finished business
What is this? Gente becoming witnesses
I don't know nothing, I don't hear nothing, I don't see nothing
Something I learned as a kid
Along with respect those who respect you
Forget about the ones that will forget about you
My recollection is a collection of a big section of mi vida
Memories I need ya, like a junky needs his chiba
I wish that I could go back and do it all over again
But I know that that ain't happening, so I sit remembering 

And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

And I remember!

Dealin with your life I took your strap, your price is right
Could tonight be the night that I feel some thing come over me

And I know you like it like porn treat the streets like hors leave em torn
In drop my rhymes like the storm when it rains it pours
I take form and I...
Hit the streets looking all nice and neat top fully creased
One hell of a looking beat the least of my feats from west to east
From north and south not knowing what it's all about top me on scout
Looking for my new recruits to follow my foot steps down my route
If you're not in you're out, to know what I'm feeling
I'm beggin you to stay and if you wanna come play
But if not your better pray cause I'm coming your way
TRUCHA

[Mr. Shadow]
Krimes pays when ever the fuck I inflict pain with pick
And I'm coming to stick you let satin be with you
Nobody will probably miss you when I diss you
If you want to fuck around with these two blad headed mothafuckas
That'll leave you in the mist when I clutch my fist
I'm pist you missed Apocalypse, I can't resist the bloodyness
The mess ain't over on 31st of October, I toldcha
The Virgin Mary won't hold, I'll scoldcha and moldcha into a deamon screamin

Now we be ducking and bucking and picture girls while they're sucking
I'm coming harder than fuck and other putos be rocking
Up on the mic it's cracking, I'm Maniac while I'm rapping
The fattest Philly I'm packing while all the Low Pros is jacking
In my neighborhood it's all good, the homies are deep
I got a four-o and more, I'm getting high and it's all on me
Gangster'd out, no doubt, mobbing saying fuck it
Still rolling hella deep with the homies in a bucket
I ain't giving a fuck, I started with the gang
My homies are here and they got my back
I'm drinking a brew, I'm smoking a sack
I'm blowing to the brain and I'm sporting all black
Ese don't you know I bang Sureno, I'm a fool too
Mobbing with the homies loading cuetes saying fuck you
Drinking, smoking, and busting lines of coke too
Dancing, freaking, and fucking all night long
On a regular basis, all to the grill, fuck at the pad then off to the hood
Drinking a brew and acting a fool, once again ese I thought you knew

[Chorus: Royal T (Lil' Rob)]
Keep it gangsta homey, keep it gangsta
(Spanish Fly tell it like it is till the day we die)
Keep it gangsta homey, keep it gangsta
(Spanish Fly tell it like it is till the day we die)
Keep it gangsta homey, keep it gangsta
(Spanish Fly tell it like it is till the day we die)
Keep it gangsta homey, keep it gangsta
(Spanish Fly tell it like it is ese)

My life is quicker than ever to grab the mic and deliver
Up on a regular basis is how we're handling cases
See me disfiguring faces on fools who tripping in places
I flash my nine in the sky, I'm getting high till I die
I let a shot in the air, 'cause where it falls I just don't really care
I ride till the wheels fall off and they ain't gonna fall off
Rolling with a pistol grip sawed off
Bang once and my name's been out
Crazy gangster representing the South
Westside what I'm talking about, Old Town what I'm talking about
Kill him and I'm finna bust that shit
Coming through with fifteen and a clip
You thought that Maniac would slip
Never me, and life's a bitch
'cause strapped with extra clips, air fifteen with a grip of Smiths
West on mine, six to the spine, aiming to delete on mines
619 down to bust a rhyme
Rest In Peace Speedy, I keep you on my mind
It was no doubt your cats are in the mix
Leave us two alone and we're coming up on shit

[Chorus]

[Silencer]
The magical thug with the magical bullet
And I'm coming around with a magical spell so
Get away, keep away when you see Silencer coming out to get ya
What you want to do, I got the cross-bow
Enemies are gonna die and I kill them real slow
Picture any toon blazing up at the moon
Your time is up, now you die from a bloody wound
That's what's gonna happen everytime I come attacking
I'm thinking of the weapon and the bodies I be stacking
On a mission, I'm packing my ammunition
I'm sticking these sons of bitches for snitching like bitches motherfucker
What you want to do, are you afraid
It's all about the Silencer, that's the name
We're some crazy motherfuckers from the West Coast
Smoking Mary Jane and we pimp hoes

I don't give a fuck and I'm here to blast you

Don't know when it's gonna end
Just like a puppet on a string he'e controlin me
I try to be cutting those string but like smokey he gots a hold on me

That's the fool that rolled on you
That's the fool that stoled on you
What the fuck you gon do
Fuck it I'll do it for you

[Lil' Rob]
I'm having a conversation with somebody who's not even there
Hearin the voices inside my head saying you'll get no where he you care
I be the Lil' Rob going insane when he calls me name
I'm hearing voices in my head and every night I do what said

[Demon Voices]
Lil' Rob... tonight is the night
I better listen to my master
It's good bye, tonight is your night
You should of never messed with me
Never mess with, maricon

[Lil' Rob]
It's the satanical, magical Lil' Rob and The Shadow
We're coming at you like horns my mother regrets I was born
And I know you like it like porn treat the streets like hors leave em torn
In drop my rhymes like the storm when it rains it pours
I take form and I...
Hit the streets looking all nice and neat top fully creased
One hell of a looking beat the least of my feats from west to east
From north and south not knowing what it's all about top me on scout
Looking for my new recruits to follow my foot steps down my route
If you're not in you're out, to know what I'm feeling
I'm beggin you to stay and if you wanna come play
But if not your better pray cause I'm coming your way
TRUCHA

[Mr. Shadow]
Krimes pays when ever the fuck I inflict pain with pick
And I'm coming to stick you let satin be with you
Nobody will probably miss you when I diss you
If you want to fuck around with these two blad headed mothafuckas
That'll leave you in the mist when I clutch my fist
I'm pist you missed Apocalypse, I can't resist the bloodyness
The mess ain't over on 31st of October, I toldcha
The Virgin Mary won't hold, I'll scoldcha and moldcha into a deamon screamin
I'm leavin you sufferin wonderin why
I have a tail a pair of horns and glowin eyes
Baptisted in boiling water fuck the father I fucked his daughter
I got her under my wing, it ain't no thing now let the Devil sing

[Devil]
I'm back
So now you know that you're gonna fuckin burn in hell
Tell what you think then I will meet you at the crossroads

Lil Rob,"Love problems Money and drug problems
That's all some shit that brings you down

My life couldn't get worse, I wake up with a curse
It's like, fuck, I woke up
Me and my chick just broke up, and I was broke up
I just lost trust for people all around me
Not just friends, not just acquaintances, but also family
And it's sad to see family be like an enemy would be
You're no longer family, now you're just an enemy to me
Don't speak to me, I'm high
Not high enough to not feel the pain
Of being betrayed, played, portrayed for a fool
That shit ain't cool, we ain't in school
I quit school because of the playground
Now my homeboys that have been down and stayed down
Well now they get around
They do what they do, do what they did, had kids
And that's all good though
It's not their fault I'm all alone, in my lonely little hood Holmes
Behind the smile theres a frown, sad enough to bring you down
Hey there Ms. Brown, I'm feelin' down
Hey there Ms. Brown, I want you 'round

Hey there Ms. Brown
I want you round
I'm feelin' down
Hey there Ms. Brown
I need you round
I'm feelin' down

I see you kickin back with the homies all the time
And I wanna try you, what would you do to, me
Is it true what they say, you could take my pain away
Leave me with nothing but sunny days, and take my rain away
Right away, what am I missing, how could I miss something I never had
Are you, really that bad, don't even know you, but I want you so bad
Guaranteed to make me feel good, I wish you would
Should I introduce myself to Ms. Brown, I think I should
Mucho gusto, such a sweet love
Sweet like chocolate, make me feel higher, than weed does
She does things to me, that make me see things, in a whole new way
I'd pay any price to feel this nice
You're priceless, make my life timeless
Thank you for your kindness
I just, can't get enough of you
You're so addictive, and I'm so addicted
Hey there Ms. Brown
I need you 'round

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' to say I'm not perfect, you see we all make mistakes
I'm far from perfect, my heart aches, my heart breaks
Wish it didn't, but it does
Wish it wasn't, but it was
Try to look you, in the eye
But I can't see, through the fuzz
It's cuz of this, it's come to this, the, loneliest loneliness
I thought two times, when my primo told me this
He said, slowly she becomes you, 'till you become her
Then your life becomes a blur and you forget who you were
I guess he's right, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I am
I'm lost, don't even know what direction I'm in
Hey there Ms. Brown, come paint a pretty picture again
I'm feelin' down, Ms. Brown make me feel better again I'd like to thank you for your, kindness
I just, can't get enough of you
You're so addictive, and I'm so addicted
Hey there Ms. Brown, I'm feelin' down I need you 'round

Lil Rob,"Hi this is Steve Austin
Reportin' live from San Diego, California
I'm here wit two controversial rappers from the city
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow A-K-A The Mayhem Click
And we're talkin' about rumors
Now Lil' Rob we understand you have an album out entitle the Crazy Life
Can you tell us what kind of rumors have you murder sense the release of that album
And some of the things you been through

Well let me put it like this
All this fools talkin' shit all the time
I was sixteen wit the bullet representin' the 6-1-9
But this fools couldn't take it, they didn't want me to make it
And so they rather hate it because they just can't fade it
Gang related, situated, now I'm back
This putos talkin' smack but I kind of like that
In a way, in one day, I might say that the ones who helped me do this
Had it any other time and I knew this I'm still foolish fools are clueless
To what I can do wit my ability thought of myself as a cholo not a real MC
And so I did what I did, I'm so glad that I did it
Because it put some chips in my pocket when I finished
Using words like Homes, Simon, and Leba
People try to put me down but end floatin' on the river
See I told you twice before but I'll say it one more time
You do your thing Homes but I'm gonna do mine

[Chorus: x2]
Look at all this rumors
Started by jealous people

And basically that's what I think
All this fuckin' fools can talk all the fuckin shit they want about me
'Cause I can give a fuck you know what I mean
It proves that I'm above their level, You Know

So Shadow we understand you havin' similar problem as those of Lil' Robs
Is there anythin' that you would like to say
To them Player Haters and if so what would it be

Man I gotta give it up to the punks tryin' to diss me
Talkin' mad shit 'cause they miss me
Reminisce me because they use to talk head about my rhymes
And when they heard me in the radio they requested till I die and I must admit
That I love you yappin' lips
'Cause it makes me ride my rolas amd my music stacks my chips
Mr. Shadow the crazy vato that fools wanna battle
When they end up undergravel when they act like who's in tattle
Now Why would you want part of this truthfulness
Don't get caught up in the mess
'Cause I hate them phony putos dippin' all up in my business ese
Got hate straight for all the fools that player hate
'Cause ain't no punk chavala stoppin' me from makin' bake
I don't need to take it to make it like claus I brake it unfaded
I be remainin' like say it I'm servin' hate to those perpetrated it

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel
Gotta tell them haters that ah
You can only witness what you see not the things you hear
Remember that

Sense we're talkin' about rumors
I heard that Lil' Rob and Shadow weren't always the best of friends
So Shadow can you clear that up for us and tell us what's really goin' on

Simon, we had some problems like a dose we had to squash it
We're from the Mayhem Click (WHY?)
'Cause everybody wants it
The baddest mother fuckers now together no one is ever gonna
Intimidate us, just imitate us player haters
Don't bother analyzin' anythin' we do
'Cause the shit we kick is tight and you know that this is true
Mr. Shadow and Lil' Rob makin' heads bob and it don't stop
'Cause we're about to keep on flowin' 'til you see our caskets drop

It's the one lil' cholo, back before I go
Just thought that I let you know that you can never stop my flow
So I suggest you put that shit to rest, quit talkin' all the mess
You're talkin' about the best and you're just wastin' your breath
As sit here, thinkin' neva thought it would be you
The city that I represent talkin' all that shit
Because all we do is kick it and mind our own business
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow scratchin' fools off the bitch list

[Chorus: x4]

So now you know where we're comin' from
And wit that it concludes the story for today
I hope you mother fuckers learned your lesson
And learn how to keep your fuckin' trap shut
And quit spreadin' rumors that ain't true
'Cause that shit be gettin' mother fuckers in trouble
And believe me, you don't want part of that
You don't want none of this The Mayhem Click

Lil Rob,"Yeah 
I used to ride my bicicleta 
Down the calles of my town 
Oldies everyday,thats the way it was 
Those were the days, the crazy ones 
A lot people died that summer 
Its a bummer but shit happens 
Or rob them in a day and see ambullences from a distance 
A place where you'd find seringes 
And the drug use was tremendous 
Some say my town was surrendous 
Until the drug use was off the hinges 
My boarder brothers would have to run fast, dash 
And hop the fences 
Dont take that out of content homeboy, 
Cus we're all gente through my lentes 
But the migra would creep down, and sweep hard 
And take them all back to tj if they didnt have the green card 
The parke was the spot, it was hot 
And it was dealin in the street 
The heroine was a killer homeboy 
It had seven killings in a week 
It was a bad bash but they still had to have that, 
So it didnt stop me 
I'd come to the pad 
And sells all the merchandise til the jura cought'em 
We used to get shit for cheap homes, like 90% off 
Give homie a little feria for his fix 
And then he sped off

[Chorus]
I was brought up, (i was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets, (where the shit goes down homes) 
Than you learn in school

In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets,(where you don't fuck around homes) 
Than you learn in school

It was cool walking to school 
See the vatos and the gatos itchin and twitchin, scratchin 
Havin a conversation with satin 
On the good one (on the good trip) 
I mean loaded off some good shit 
You might not believe it 
But ey homes this aint no bullshit 
My town was all brown man, 
The gente and the drogas 
People walking around fucked up, druged up, lookin all sucked up 
But thats where I was brought up 
Where a lot of people shot up 
Got caught up and locked up 
Its not just sumthin that I thought up 
It was somthing that was happenin 
And I seen it with my own eyes eh 
La colonia, eden gardens californ I a 
Got a little older 
And my blood got a little colder 
Started taggin up my plaquaso up on my barrio 
Up on my folder 
Me and homeboys we would walk the calles 
Lookin like soldiers 
With the chip on their shoulders 
The size of bolders,little lokesters 
Down to get down with the next town when they came around 
We be throwin chicasos, 
We be spittin balazos

I was brought up, (i was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets,(where you dont fuck around homes) 
Than you learn in school

It wasn't long before I got mine 
See I got shot at the stop sign 
Took a bala to the boca 
Got blood all over my ropa 
I lost a couple of homies 
I got some friends up in the pin 
But when they get out 
It seems like they go right back in again 
It all started out with crazy situations 
Juvinall hall and probation 
Then get busted for violation 
That leaves a lifetime incarcaration 
But my town went through some changes 
One thing will never change 
It made me who I am 
And I remain to stay the same

I'm feeling good now, Its all good in the neighborhood homes

I feel good, I feel all right
Cruising through the neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good
That's right
I feel good now, summer nights

Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Call the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone, Its
Seven thirty and the sun is going down, Its a
Summer night and the fun is going down
I picked her up and she looks all dolled up (She looks good)
Sitting passenger in my rag impala (yeah)
I let her know she looks beautiful to me
The world is an ugly place but she's such a site to see
The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants to spend summer nights with me
The temp was eighty and I'm cruising with my lady
Playing some Ralphie Pagan, ""Oh Baby Baby""
I see my home boys and they're cruising in their rides (Hey was up homes)
With their ladies sitting by their side
People think we look crazy, but I think we look classy
But then again that's only if you ask me


Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party

Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

My homeboys throwing a back yard boogie,
So every body gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time
The DJ is spinning so I grab the mic and be like
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
The party is packed with beautiful woman and
A gang of the homies that want to get with them
And they'll say anything just to hit em
And its usually a nice summer night when they did em
I don't know, it must be something in the air
Can't help but have a good time, because the feeling is there
To some people the feeling is rare
They're at the pad saying God dam I wish I was there
To have a drink, have a tok and hook up
With some one fine but the kind that looks up
Got to keep some pisto in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up

Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time with your life otherwise it's just a waste
Either way I'm gonna party just in case
Like prince partied like it was 99, in 87, 88
I couldn't ask for no better weather, I'm right next to the Pacific to be specific
The candy paint job glows under the moon light
As I close out my summer night and say good night
Its time to put the top up and park it, drop it
Unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
Walk into the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long
From dust til dawn
But its not the quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when they're gone, it won't be long
Eight more months and once again its on

Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light

Lil Rob,"[Steve Austin]
Hi this is Steve Austin
Reportin' live from San Diego, California 
I'm here wit two controversial rappers from the city 
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow A-K-A The Mayhem Click
And we're talkin' about rumors
Now Lil' Rob we understand you have an album out entitle the Crazy Life
Can you tell us what kind of rumors have you murder sense the release of that album
And some of the things you been through

[Verse One: Lil' Rob]
Well let me put it like this
All this fools talkin' shit all the time 
I was 16 wit the bullet representin' the 6-1-9
But this fools couldn't take it, they didn't want me to make it
And so they rather hate it because they just can't fade it
Gang related, situated, now I'm back
This putos talkin' smack but I kind of like that 
In a way, in one day, I might say that the ones who helped me do this 
Had it any other time and I knew this I'm still foolish fools are clueless
To what I can do wit my ability thought of myself as a cholo not a real MC
And so I did what I did, I'm so glad that I did it 
Because it put some chips in my pocket when I finished
Using words like Homes, Simon, and Leba
People try to put me down but end floatin' on the river
See I told you twice before but I'll say it one more time
You do your thing Homes but I'm gonna do mine

[Chorus: x2]
Look at all this rumors
Started by jealous people

[Lil' Rob]
And basically that's what I think 
All this fuckin' fools can talk all the fuckin shit they want about me 
Cause I can give a fuck you know what I mean 
It proves that I'm above their level, You Know

[Steve Austin]
So Shadow we understand you havin' similar problem as those of Lil' Robs
Is ther anythin' that you would like to say 
To them Player Haters and if so what would it be

[Verse Two: Mr. Shadow]
Man I gotta give it up to the punks tryin' to diss me 
Talkin' mad shit 'cause they miss me 
Reminisce me because they use to talk head about my rhymes
And when they heard me in the radio they requested till I die and I must admit
That I love you yappin' lips 
Cause it makes me ride my rolas amd my music stacks my chips
Mr. Shadow the crazy vato that fools want to battle 
When they end up undergravel when they act like who's in tattle 
Now Why would you want part of this truthfulness
Don't get caught up in the mess 
Cause I hate them phony putos dippin' all up in my business ese 
Got hate straight for all the fools that player hate
Cause ain't no punk chavala stoppin' me from makin' bake
I don't need to take it to make it like claus I brake it unfaded
I be remainin' like say it I'm servin' hate to those perpetrated it 

[Chorus 2X]
[Mr. Shadow over Chorus]
Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel
Gotta tell them haters that ah
You can only witness what you see not the things you hear
Remember that

[Steve Austin]
Sense we're talkin' about rumors
I heard that Lil' Rob and Shadow weren't always the best of friends
So Shadow can you clear that up for us and tell us what's really goin' on

[Verse Three: Mr. Shadow]
Simon, we had some problems like a dose we had to squash it
We're from the Mayhem Click (Why?)
Cause everybody wants it
The baddest mother fuckers now together no one is ever gonna 
Intimidate us, just imitate us player haters 
Don't bother analyzin' anythin' we do 
Cause the shit we kick is tight and you know that this is true
Mr. Shadow and Lil' Rob makin' heads bob and it don't stop 
Cause we're about to keep on flowin' 'til you see our caskets drop

[Verse Four: Lil' Rob]
It's the one lil' cholo, back before I go
Just thought that I let you know that you can never stop my flow
So I suggest you put that shit to rest, quit talkin' all the mess
You're talkin' about the best and you're just wastin' your breath
As sit here, thinkin' neva thought it would be you
The city that I represent talkin' all that shit
Because all we do is kick it and mind our own business
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow scratchin' fools off the bitch list

[Chorus: x4]

[Mr. Shadow]
So now you know where we're comin' from
And wit that it concludes the story for today
I hope you mother fuckers learned your lesson
And learn how to keep your fuckin' trap shut
And quit spreadin' rumors that ain't true
Cause that shit be gettin' mother fuckers in trouble 
And believe me, you don't want part of that 
You don't want none of this The Mayhem Click
And we're out",Rumors,2007
Lil Rob,"Ese Lil Rob
We go through them hard times man
Just gotta keep our heads up
Keep on walking

[Chorus]
These Cortez Shoes know all the hard times that we had been through
All the crazy things we used to do just to get by walk in my shoes and you
Will see why these cortez shoes try n walk in these cortez shoes betcha could'nt
Walk in a mile in these shoes but we get by and we got to keep on walking

Let me take you back a way homie back in my day before that I figured
Out that crime doesn't pay I was ont the streets every night and everyday out with
The homies hanging out having a good time hey but sometimes a good time ended up
Jump in a ride and go blast on the vatos from the other side my uncles did it my
Brother did it and now so do I no need to wonder why I was a victim of a drive
By it turned into a shoot out but they ain't getting away hell no not with out a bullet
Wound ay that was my state of mind all the time don't cross the line and believe me
When I say that the line was fine you might catch me in a bad mood with a bad
Attitude a lil homeboy who hates to loose or you could be talking shit about me right
Now but you could'nt walk a mile in my shoes ya feel me homes come on

[Chorus]

My homeboy called me up said turn on the TV that's when I got the news
Of my homeboy peewee rest in peace to the deceased beneath the barrio streets
When I saw him on the news he had cortez on his feet we went through it some of
Us made it some of us blew it who would of knew it I remember crazy times in the

Buick crazy shit we were likely to do it I wasn't really serious about music it's just to
Easy to loose it and a lot of us do it itchy finger on the trigger easy to pull it we live
Our life by the bullet we either die or get locked up make a mess to big to be
Mopped up behind the smile there's a frown sad enough to bring you down a lil
Homeboy who sings the blues because he had no clue what to do in his life walking
Around in his cortez shoes that's what I used to do

[Chorus]

I got shot down the block at the spot ran from cops never thought it
Would stop never hit the county or Juvenal hall but that's only cause I didn't get caught
An I can only imagine what would of happened if I continued scrapping n capping
Blasting an laughing I'll prolly be dead or in jail then I wouldn't be standing here rapping
About my cortez shoes

If I could go back I would slow it down
If I could turn back I would slow it down

Do it again
Do, do, do it again
Oah

Ain't got no time for no bullshit
Gotta make moves quick
If you snooze then you lose it
Lay you down like my cheverlet
After a day of play
After i juice it
Get stupid
Hit the corner crooked
Don't remember how i took it
Don't remember how i made it
I remember being faded
Remember when i had more than anticipated
Got intoxicated
I almost got incarcirated
Put my petal to the metal
Hear me screechin' down the pavement
I'm messy lil rob
And I'm back up on the block
In a rag top with a back drop not knowin' when to stop
So i'ma keep on rollin' till the wheels are fallin' off
And it might get a little crazy but nobody call the cops
We got it under control
We're on a gangsta stroll
Watchin' out for the pigs on patrol
'Cause my homboys on parole
My little homboys on probation
Still gots a chance to change his life
But right now its incarciration that he's facin'

Slow it down
If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again
Do it again
Do, do, do it again
Oah

See homboy vato down the block 
He told me vato got shot
In the parking lot of the taco shop
The towns been hot
Been full of cops 
Been full of blacas
I told them i don't really understand it homie
Bumpin' this is for la raza
Hit the switch like this
Its your big end of the street
Where i keep my cuete under my seat
Where i keep on the creep
Where we go to the grave with the secrets we keep
And i'ma always keep my word so that i'm able to sleep
I'm bumpin' the beat when i heard her body talkin' to me
I like what its sayin' and i love what i see
You're comin' with me
Her body's cold and comfortable the whole
So magicly now she's sittin' in my passenger seat
We got it under control
We rollin' low
It's so slow i 
Hit the land yo and live my life in slow mo
If i could do this one more
Time again just tell me when so i can do it again

Slow it down
If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again
Do it again
Do, do, do it again
Oah

See one of my homboys he's doin' good
He started life over
Another homboy not so good
He slid now life's over
He was supposed to be gettin' married
In february
Now he's in the coffin being carried at the cemetary
Getting burried
Take a hit of the joint and keep it cherry
'Cause this shit is gettin' heavy
Like the chevy on 5 twentys
And that's pretty heavy
Tryna make that pretty penny
Where there's plenty
And i'll be damned if i ain't makin' any
Comin' out stronger than many
Many bolder than most
We get sick with it
Sicker than my flows; fuckin' gross
The products was where i was brought up
It's the bomb like a feline
Tag my name on a street sign
Throwin' up the peace sign
Lookin' for a feline
That's bad enough to be mine
Fuck ya homboy; she fine
So we gon' keep on rollin'
Even if i don't know where i'm goin'

Slow it down
If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again

I could spend all day watching you
Girl I'm just a man I'm not stalkin' you
I've had many conversations with many women
But for some reason I can't talk to you
You don't wanna hear them lies
Sure it happens a lot
You probably hear them all the time
But I bullshit you not I like you a lot
And I just really wanna be on your mind
Maybe I can head to your spot
And pick you up around seven o' clock
And we can do whatever you want, however you like
And we don't ever have to stop
Your smile brightens up a room
And I don't think I ever get enough of you
But I just really wanna fuck with you
And I really wouldn't mind being stuck with you

I'll do anything you ask me to

Fool around, Fall in love and crash
But anytime with you would be worth it
A lifetime with you would be perfect
You're beautiful and intelligent too
The last thing you need is an arrogant foo
Who don't know how to treat someone like you
It's lucky for you that I do
Hey don't let no one get you down
Not even me but I won't let you down
Smiles on my face when you come around
But when you leave it turns upside down
You could be my confessions to my expressions
My expressions will answer any questions
I only have eyes for you
I only want you and I won't except no exceptions

And there ain't nothing that I won't do
I'll pull a star from the sky for you
if you ask me to
I wanna be more than just your friend
ill only stop to start again
If I could talk to you what would you say
What are the chances you feel the same way
Would you say you're in love with me
And that you want nothing more than to be stuck with me

I've been, detonatin equivalyrical exposives 
Rambo soldiers deep like the black trials of Moses 
Madness and wisdom accelerates my pendulum 
No attackin my forces of life, cause I got ten of em 
Dangerous, disciple killin images 
My warfare dreads be just like Nemesis 
Infiltrates, holy massacres like ?tnakarid? 
My religion break down prisons for missionaries 
In it to survive, so enlist, in strategies 
My non-exist thinkin only lead, to casualties 
I'm battlin, invadin, interceptin 
Makin sure don't nuttin move in your section 
Don't misinterpret my threats as just talk 
and the raise of a hand can make, worlds start haltin 
The almighty, leavin Gods and nations lost 
Cause when my shit hits I leave holes like sawed-offs 



Yo, it's the Mad child layin verses like tile 
Niggaz go impotent, when I kick these potent ass freestyles 
Wack MC's get mad and look at me hard 
Cause they used to be the shit, like McDonald's on Broad 
It's odd, how niggaz try to bomb 
Then I be fadin more motherfuckers than AIDS story harvest 
Throwin niggaz away like apple cores - I don't want to see shit 
but some hits and Ed McMahon at my front door 
I'm rippin tapes, niggaz still makin SHIT cakes 
Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin to get they shit straight 
I'm tryin to get paid troop -- I want more G's 
than a girl named GiGi gaggin on some gin and garlic glue 
Niggaz think they hype, but they ain't touchin these 
Their styles plaid out like stripe cuffed Lee's 
Please! In ninety-five, I'ma be straight 
Stealin MC's like DJ's be stealin milk crates 
Ask Dre, can't nobody hack it, they ill Dre? 
You get beheaded with a motherfuckin hatchet 
Haste makes waste and taste the bass 
When you see me - you don't see me get the FUCK out my face

To them heads Raw Deal, rock the spot 
To Mike the Merciless, rock the spot 
To my brother Danja Mowf, rock the spot..",Unseen World,1995
Lil Rod-D,"I thought I heard your voice amid the noise on the street. 
I imagined it at best, but the knot in my chest still skipped a beat. 
I cannot concentrate or think at all of late for the thought of you, 
Though it's been so long since the day I found you were gone when I came to. 

Llast night, I saw your face. but something was wrong that I could not quite place. 
Suddenly I began to realize: the eyes I did not recognize. 
I woke up with a start and a pounding heart, gasping for air. 
I thought you were a ghost, or a dream at most, but you're everywhere. 
Was that you just then, calling me again?","Out of Sight, Out of Mind",2000

If you gonna rap about it be trill about it
And don't say shit if you can't be real about it

Comin' up as a child my city was hell
My moma was the best soldier, dad stayed in out of jail
I came robbin' and kickin' in doors then on my behalf and 17 old
But ya see shorty, My mom was a G
She made it real easy for my sista and me
She did what she had to do, 
And got out the damn crowd like a nigga would do
Talkin' about pimpin', o she did that too
I got robbed and this old nigga took all my loot
And I was just twelve years old on thirteen skin and bones 
That's why I thank my heart to sell dope
I gives a fuck about none of you hoes
All you fake thugs think about is grills and gold, 
And pressin' these doors
(shorty) and cakin these hoes
I'ma pimp, I spend my time makin' these hoes

Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Moma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, don't be askin' me why
Ill rather hustle in the cold 'cause niggas sprayin' wit' fire
All the childhood fixin's wit tha devil inside the kitchen
Got my mind on my gun and I'm finna pull a pistol

You see the streets, 
They'll shallow you whole, mind body and soul
And leave you in a ditch wit no shoes and clothes
Waitin' for the trash collector
Follow me mind selector to the ghetto sector
They'll kill you over thirty dollars
I seen a man cut wit a dirty bottle blood squirted on his shirt and collar
I heard him holla a sound that I can't forget
Ran home, watched cartoons and ain't said shit
And to this day moma thought I was young, hungry, and poor (par)
While she was at the church praising the lord
I made through amazingly unscarred
She had to be praying 'cause I made it by the grace of the god
I'm proud of my hard times, I spit hard rhymes

Dreaming of naming streets and boulevards mine
Grab yo piece of the pie, the other parts mine

If you a thug my nigga be a thug
If you sell drugs my nigga then sell drugs
If you gonna rap about it be trill about it
And don't say shit if you can't BE REAL about it

Comin' up as a child my city was hell
My moma was the best soldier, dad stayed in out of jail
I came robbin' and kickin' in doors then on my behalf and 17 old
But ya see shorty, My mom was a G
She made it real easy for my sista and me
She did what she had to do, 
And got out the damn crowd like a nigga would do
Talkin' about pimpin', o she did that too
I got robbed and this old nigga took all my loot
And I was just twelve years old on thirteen skin and bones 
That's why I thank my heart to sell dope
I gives a fuck about none of you hoes
All you fake thugs think about is grills and gold, 
And pressin' these doors
(shorty) and cakin these hoes
I'ma pimp, I spend my time makin' these hoes

[Chorus]

Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Moma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, don't be askin' me why
Ill rather hustle in the cold 'cause niggas sprayin' wit' fire
All the childhood fixin's wit tha devil inside the kitchen
Got my mind on my gun and I'm finna pull a pistol

You see the streets, 
They'll shallow you whole, mind body and soul
And leave you in a ditch wit no shoes and clothes
Waitin' for the trash collector
Follow me mind selector to the ghetto sector
They'll kill you over thirty dollars
I seen a man cut wit a dirty bottle blood squirted on his shirt and collar
I heard him holla a sound that I can't forget
Ran home, watched cartoons and ain't said shit
And to this day moma thought I was young, hungry, and poor (par)
While she was at the church praising the lord
I made through amazingly unscarred
She had to be praying 'cause I made it by the grace of the god
I'm proud of my hard times, I spit hard rhymes
Bible in one hand, the other hand nine
Dreaming of naming streets and boulevards mine
Grab yo piece of the pie, the other parts mine

Lil Scrappy,"Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin' a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin' y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin'
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin' for a livin'
It's, mo' because of what I do and how I'm livin'
Not to mention when I'm rappin' I'm just hurtin' niggaz feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin' on somethin' that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin' it pimpin'
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Chorus]
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

I'm the prince shorty don't get it twisted
Been callin' shots simpin' 'fore my flows existed
And still find birds in my momma kitchen
You might see me burnin' purple in the subdivision
I got soldiers on deck, babyface pimpin'
Whatchu' know 'bout dat, I get a bad Brenda
With that vert' top back, my jeans feelin tight
Cause my pockets stay fat, playa better know that
My neck got so much shit, danglin'
Big dick, big chain, we just keep on hangin'
Got a Hollywood ho, and a broad that be sangin'
They be hatin cause I'm famous ? what I was thankin'
And this for every don nigga thankin he passed me
Y'all just thank that you gone and the shit'll be nasty
I'ma stay ballin', ballin' off my old school classic
Lil Scrap got big bank, now see if you can match it

Shorty I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number one hustler, I keep the street blazin'
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry pickin' hustlers out here slavin'
That king shit nigga runs deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne
That's pimpin! My gas is premium like octane
Can't tell me nothin' 'bout stackin' these Benja-maynes
I'm the king of the Dirty, see me seated in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a prince that's so demandin' and an aura so strong
The South ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin' on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'ma blick 'em 'til I get you plain and simple

Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong

Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolinas, Virginia to David Banner's home
I'm well connected, haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38 but hey, the hammer chrome

And it shine like ya should set the phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like the saxophone
Hey shawty, spit the shit, it takes to cut a candle on

And don't let it alarm ya when ya leaking then the reapers upon ya
Speak on me and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't tha King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya

All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya

Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates

I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate, who in the way?

I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state

Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me
Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt
Gucci so gutter he'll steal money out ya purse
Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt
Black tee, black beat, trapping on the front street
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me
Bubble gum wappin' ass niggas can't smoke me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It's Bun B in his black tee & G in his black tee
Repping UGK and BAT in his black tee
Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee
Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee
Gucci chain swinging on the front of his black tee
Cadillac swinging, smoking blunts in his black tee
Stunt in his black tee, Ball in his black tee
It ain't just me pimping we all got a black tee

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
And I got a 1-2 Bun
Got 36 O's for the 2-1
Jeezy bout them green guys
Got H-town going for the ten or fives
I'm talking cornflakes
Black inner tubes wrapped in black duck tape
Say it again dog to make sure that you heard me
Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I got the all black Chevy on all black rims
Keep a small black gat in my all black Tims
On the all-black leather there's a all-black mack
Trying to snatch get ya black ass blowed the fuck back
44 to ya torso 4 in ya hat
Kick doja to ya house n put it to a cataract
Gorillas wit banana clips going monkey in the back
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze]
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee
Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street
Chilling by a black Cadillac on sum black feet
Scrappy in a Chevy watching Scarface on the flat screen
Told y'all constantly, ride wit the pump wit me
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath
I ain't gotta keep telling y'all niggas I'ma G
I'ma just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: 4-Tre]
I'm s-stainless in my black tee
Remaining in my black tee
On the grind cause I like to shine in my black tee
Diamond glistening cross plus the background is a black tee
Thieve then come back spraying rounds in my black tee
4-Tre, I want war in my black tee
Fuck them, probably never wore a black tee
Working in my black tee, smoking purple in my black tee
I'm looking for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee

[Verse 7: Lil Scrappy]
Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on
Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm going straight for the bread home
I don't know why y'all niggas dropped move b
Cause now Raheem'll show ya punk ass a tree
Bust nuts in my black tee, sluts in my black tee
Now I'm smoking nothing but blunts in my black tee
Saw me in Valve then tried to fight me
Just the same monkey shorty don't take me lightly

Lil Scrappy,"Hey how you doin lil mama?
Lemme whisper in your ear
Tell you sumthing that you might like to hear
You got a sexy ass body and your ass look soft
Mind if I touch it? and see if its soft
Naw I'm jus playin' lets just say I can
And I'm known to be a real nasty man
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So I don't mind asking for head
You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed
And you can start using yo head
You like to fuck, have yo legs open all in da butt
Do it up slappin ass 'cause the sex gets rough
Switch positions and ready to get down to business
So you can see what you've been missin'
You might had some but you never had none like this

'Cause I'll beat dat cat with a dog
And knock da walls of a broad til she scrawl

A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Momma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, dont be askin me why
Ill rather hustle in the cold 'cause niggas sprayin' wit' fire
All the childhood fixin's wit' tha devil inside the kitchen

Remember back about 10, majors wouldn't let us in
Servin' school is a lifestyle, but they treat it like it's a trend
Man, they like ""koopa tell me where the hell you been""
Man, I been dealin' with family, and takin' care of ben
Franklin, ain't the end, I was here when it begin
See if ya ridin' davin rims, celebrate by lettin' em' spin
I bought some new ones in, to replace the older rims
What type of rims? that depends is it the truck, the bike, or van
Had to hop out, and stop my spinners on the rims
My alarm kept detecting motion pokin' out of them
Man, I'm just sayin', y'all know koopa don't be playin'
I'm just sayin', I be layin' with the flat tv's displayin'

Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price
I'm trying to get right, get it and go
You see people is dyin' fast, and the money is slow
We used to hang in front of the store
Flag down cars to be a movie star, go get a glass jar
Once you cook it and cut it homie, go stand out in public
See the work sell's itself, if ya got enough of it
Plenty thugs get shot, but see its all in the game
Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain
I ain't dippin' from that same lead project figga
I done went with no lights, and no water nigga
And I'm still hood, that mean I still cook
Get on the block and go get mine, like you should

You know tha kid stay with his Nike's new, tha throwback is light blue
Came out around the time, my grandmother graduated high school
Most these rap niggas softer than Ja Rule
And they've been in and out as many walkmans as I do
Take time, to figure out who's walkin' beside you
Cause this sonic can feel like a fork when inside you
You mad, cause ya bitch like us
And all of my records get thumbs up, like I'm ridin' by hitchikers
Stumblin' out the g4, cause that's how tha stars land
Shit I prolly been through more trees than tarzan
On tha road, tha hoes take a look at tha cars and
It's back tha hotel, titties and bras man
Tha new ""strap don""
You might call me ignorant, but if you cow you belong in tha phat farm
When tha lights get bigger I act calm

Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

Through my whole life course I've been off the chain
And niggas knew I been broke way before the fame!
I been havin' crazy thoughts, of murder a nigga

Click clack, tha prince is back
Even tho I been here I still owe y'all that
A nigga been low key, but I'm off da rack
Just off da corner sold weed, now I'm back to crack

Had to get some new bullets and some even bigger guns
Movin' in and out of traffic like I'm still on the run
Got my vest on shawty and I'm strappin' a ton
Ev'rythang all good 'cause I'm fuckin' with Jon

That's where, a nigga straight fell to the airport
Bought 2 first class seats to New York
To see if I could go and ball in the same coat
Me and my bitch both, two guns we tot

A nigga was weak, now the goon is woke
Ain't even no question about the nines I roll
Got hit with a bottle and I still got flow

Like getting pushed off the stage by the police station
I dunno what the hell wrong with all these pigs
Another police touch me and I'm gonna sue him again

He might have been broke, I gotta raise these kids
I don't think some of y'all know what you're playin' with
Had a sick manager who took my benefit
Fuckin' with violator now that picture look real big

On some real shit, my nigga Vic gon' be rich
Pray to God forgive him for the dirt that he did
When I wasn't on TV you forgot about me
I took it upon myself to remind you 'bout me

I'm back, hotter than a nigga in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well

Don't be thinkin' that ya boy ain't been grinding
I was with my momma and there was a lotta drama
We sold crack from the winter all through the summer

Yeah, we went through pain, we was stacking change
Paying the cost to live in the streets mayne
Sold cocaine just a little powder
Sellin' weed tryna make a couple of extra dollars

The shit I been through a nigga should've been a scholar
All night tryna sleep hearing pistols hollar, damn
Now when your plannin' to die, you know a nigga cried
Not having him around, you know it hurt inside

Gotta have shelter over my lil' sister
Momma wondering around 'cause she a drug dealer
I gotta give it to her 'cause she a real nigga
I kill any mo'focker doing something to her, yup

They wanna be on stage right, they wanna get paid
But they don't know the hurt and they can't feel my pain
On stage gettin' hit with a bottle
Knocked out and I need to know if I'mma rap tomorrow

In the hospital straight bruised up
Got a cut from my lip and my thumbs up, damn
It's kind of fucked up, 'cause I waz showin' love
I was givin' hugs, chillin' with the thugs

Al I'm tryna do is show love to everybody
God let me alive so I can tell about it, Amen
See I don't scream and shout it, but I go to church
What ya know about puttin' in that brown work

They throwin' up signs and they dyin' for it, I'm crip and a blood
Niggaz taking lives goin' to jail payin' for it
Ain't nothing left after death but heaven itself
And if ya go to jail your seed will have no help

Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no

Dear Lord, it's a letter to You
A young nigga hurtin' and I don't know what to do
I try to live life right but these cowards be hatin'
It's like every where I go I run into the same

I'm on this earth with my blessings and my curse
Just thinking how we live threw riddin' the hearse
Even though You know me ever since I was birth
I'm innocent till You judge me and that comes first

And I ain't tryin' to burn Lord 'cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding, I only rob for the thirst
I knew it was wrong that I was snatching her purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt

Yeah, I wanna go to church but I can't be faithful
I'm always doin' shows but You know that I'm great full
I churn wheat for the fruit 'cause it be tasteful
I don't know in the world how I could ever repay You

Lord have mercy on me, heard nigga say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me, ridin' around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no

Aye Chris, can you sit your ass down my nigga?
Damn a man can't even write to God

Dear Lord, I thank You for lookin' out for my fam
Havin' my lil' brother who don't give a damn
You see my lil' sista done got pregnant
And my momma actin' crazy and ain't changin'

And I pray that You keep my pops preachin'
'Cause if he ain't around there's no body teachin'
And please keep my baby momma from being a bitch
Excuse my language Lord but it's always friction

I wanna thank You for blessing me with my little girl
But please give me the power to fight the whole world
'Cause I swear on You if they touch my kid
I'ma be sitting down writing You again

Lord have mercy on me, heard nigga say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me, ridin' around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now
But it's president (Georgia) Bush

Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya
Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down

And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly

Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sip seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfucking ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed

Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos

Stand up
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up
If you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga
Stand up
You don't want to see the triggerman bust
Hit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to
Stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move
Stand up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You got a gator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash
145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man
I spent my childhood in a wild hood
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G.
You want to overthrow me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder campy
Niggas is murder happy
12 years old, I jumped off the pot
I started selling rock right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down

[Chorus]",Stand Up,2008
Lil Scrappy,"Growing up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same little' nigga that taught your brother to smoke

But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move is up on the tube
Whoever said being a gangsta was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy

To be a gangsta is a full time job
A bad a boy but I ain't Black Rob
The pays good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'm gonna see ya degraded

I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead
Because they don't bury the scared man they bury the dead

Lil Scrappy,"It's so incredible
Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling

In the AM baby we'll be nothing
And you say you like that real thugging
But you hate it when them ? cuffin
Confused flow, for real though
Love came through the front, went out the back door
Emotions are running, depression is coming
Can't believe you love me, cause your feelings are funny

[Chorus: x2]
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here

My heart on broken, confidence stolen
Mind going crazy, should I stay or keep going
She don't love me, well I gotta embrace it
If I don't love her, baby girl you gotta face it
The thang about love you can't find it you neither trace it
If love was a test, you either fail or you ace it
Love me, for who I am
If not, shit I don't give a damn
You want the cars, house and designer things
I get it baby girl, you want the finer things
And I ain't hatin on you, go and get it now
Matter fact, go and get it Now, matter fact make daddy proud
Everything change when you say the L word
Cause I can't say it back I don't know what to tell her
I can't find no love here
You say what is love, it's a powerful word
And it's more than great, man that shit can hurt

Got a lot of hard feelings, wall up
Barred up, caught up, start up
Don't wanna fall cause
I can't let another one in

[Chorus: x2]

Live on the web, we're shooting up the celebs
And I'm goin' through hell, wanna release a couple shells
You wanna upgrade baby and that's a fact
But you don't get a nigga just like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
You leave a real nigga shawty I bet you come right back
And you say that I cheated in the past, that's true
And in the future I did everything you asked me Boo
Yeah I cheated and you cheated
But in the end, it's in the wind baby where we meet
It's not the end, we pretend
And make this our little secret

If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
I'm go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that Super Soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

Said I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that Wood now she goin' for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
Yea she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more

Man a see a clear port plane on me

You see me coming around your corner lookin' like I got a check
Flew into your city me my niggas on the jet
Ballin' every time I take a shot I hit the net
And everyday niggas want the money for respect
I ain't trippin' I got money, clothes, car, hoes
Shoppin' 'til the mall close
Lord knows, I could fit a brick up in these cargos
I don't fuck with niggas cause they all told
Worry 'bout another nigga money like they all hoes
I'm just with my niggas spining hella blocks
Bad bitch on all my banshee I'm like twelve o' clock
Vroom vroom I might do a hundred block
In the back hundred niggas deep and we like fuck the cops

I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing
Got all these chains and this change on me
Niggas said I changed man they changed on me
Man it ain't a thang everything on me
Man a see a clear port plane on me

What's your grandma name
What's your gr-gr-grandma name, grandma name
What's your grandma name
What's my grandma name

I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing",Outro,2016

Should I lay my heart on the line now

I can't hide it, I can't fight it

Cannot deny it, you've got it

[Hook :x 2]
In the ghetto, I'm living in a ghetto world
In the ghetto (in the ghetto), it's a struggle but I gotta maintain

[Trae]
Welcome to the ghetto, where forever be the same
Hard times, got my people unable to maintain
Everytime I look around, it's somebody doing bad
That'll put you in the grave, for som'ing they never had

Everyday in the hood, it be the same thang
Poverty running my people, so they love pain
And I don't know if it's wrong, but still I know it ain't right
I seen a lot of people die, in the street life

The other day it hit my heart, when I watch the news
A lil' girl got killed, while she was 'sleep in her room
And she ain't deserve to die, cause that's a kid dog
Them niggaz took the life, that she ain't get to live at all

Sometimes I want to help the ghetto, but it ain't gon do a thang
'Cause I know that they ignant, and that's a god damn shame
It's an everyday task, trying to live a good life
Inside of the ghetto, where everybody be shife

[Hook: x 2]

[Yung Redd]
Welcome to the South, niggaz ain't sleep at all
Everybody out on the block, stay ducking them laws
A couple niggaz on parole, hustling by the sto'
I'm telling that ain't the way to go, play your role

But you don't hear me though, this what I'm living fo'
Hustle till I get mine, grind cause I need mo'
Shots release, too late for you to scream peace
This how it is in the street, leaving is obsolete

And still I maintain, seeing the same thang
Sometime I scream, my brain just looking for a change
But day in and day out, I move in and move out
Keep my bidness discrete, I'm on a paper route

I wasn't broke for nothing, still I was learning some'ing
If you ain't been through nothing, then you ain't seen nothing
This how it really is, around my way
Where anybody can get it, anytime of the day

[Lil Boss]
I analyze the block, babies are running round with glocks
Dope in they socks, can't skip hot so fuck the cops
Moving from crumbs to bricks, nigga these slums are thick
I try to tell my lil' niggaz, but they think they slick

These white folks don't play, they gon hot your way
They try to give you twenty years, just for living the wrong way
And who's to say now-a-day, right from wrong
They ain't living how we live, so they can't get in my zone

We get chased home for stones, and laws want to break our bones
In places in and out a high cell, to roam
And that's prolly the reason, we going crazy
Pissed at poverty, cause the system trying to fade me

Lately, I've been trying to stay out of trouble
But it's hard to stop from copping, the sack and flipping the double
Don't catch the wrong route, when you on that Metro
There's a sign in front of the hood, that says Welcome To the Ghetto

[Hook: x 2]

[Spice 1]
I wonder, if heaven got a ghetto
But be	-burning down the be	-block, I put the petal to the medal
Running with my cousins in Texas, Lil' Cross and Big Money
My nigga Trae and Lil' Joe, nigga all action

In the ghetto, I've been riding through the hood for years
And ain't a damn thang changed, mama still shedding tears
Niggaz fresh out the Penn, some niggaz just going in
Some niggaz gon run and stutter, turning they self in

Never seen a black man, flying dope on a plane
But they lock us up for it, shackle us with chains
Welcome to the ghetto, ghetto starts and mob cars
With bullet holes in it, niggaz shot up and scarred

But still living, driven by the game itself
To stay alive in these cold streets, mashing for wealth
Up in this ghetto, O.G.'s P's and see's
Thugs, pimps, playas hit the 6-4's or 3's

What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me

If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices

I've been so many places, still I don't know where I want to be

But I want you to know before I go, that baby, we could've had it all
We could've had it all

[Bad Azz]
Just to be alive is a blessing to me
Hey, you can lose your mind and heavy stress moving
Recently, I've been talking to myself a lot
I answer back, thinking 'I ain't supposed to answer that'
Is that a fact? Am I losing it for what I said?
Or is it 'cause a nigga talking and ain't no one there
I can't remember 'cause I'm scared, I don't look back
It's hell behind me and I ain't trying get took back
I know you feel me, stressing, learning lessons of life
Till they kill me, and we'll be, alright in the long run
Maybe mix son gin with my life 'cause we all gone crazy
And maybe, we'd learn to maintain
It'd help us stay sane, for the time we remain
Or maybe, the rest of the world'd lose they mind
And we'd die not knowing how we wasted perfect time
Damn, (we could've had it all)

[Lil' Beau]
I'm on top of the world and about it
Yeah, it don't make sense, only chase for sex and presidents
Probably next on the set but I check myself quick
My old homies want to get me (fuck why y'all), the devil want to hit me
Flashing cash that like ? on ass
Giving into greed, doing dirty deeds for the last time
I swore to God it was, but I lie
I try to stay clean but clocking green made the Holy Ghost die
That's why B.T. banging now, that's why bigets is slanging 'round
It's 'cause we don't know how, to stay sane in this game
Having chips and then they took away, it's just another face of pain
And while I got a couple bitches try and dirty up my name
Getting served by a couple hoes, gobble up the game, going crazy
And still grind sales in this paying-the-world game
But I choke, it ain't nobody fall but Lil' Beau
Tell the tag on my toe and nigga mourn what he here for
Friends be the snakes in disguise so I fear for 'em
Knowing Jesus watching all my homies and my kinfolk
Guide me the right way, you'll pay for ? yourself, yeah

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Tip Toe]
I wake up early in the morning everyday, when the sun rise
Just praying for the world to come together before my son rise
And get old, and have to go through life without a daddy
Just because your Caddy came through with a barrel pointed at me
Life is short to being happy, so I live with smiles and hugs
But some folks, they rather trip to spitting rounds of slugs
I keep it real for those that choose to learn game from me
I'd probably blast myself before you'd ever see a change in me
I'm going crazy out here, God help me if you will
I try to keep it real, on my journey up the hill for a mil
But still, I got too many choices to make
And while Tha Lowlifes rising to the top they hoping we brake
Lil' Tip'll never fall without a reason from God
You will never fall without a reason from God

Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And drop it on yo fuckin' head, haha
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker

Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""Fuck 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce  and olives
I'll fuckin'

Money over fear
Her lipstick smeared
Her pussy lip pierced
Daddy gotta go
After daddy get his
See ya later alligator
Crying crocodile tears
Don't worry I'll be back
If her pussy like crack
She got a nice rack
And that apple bottom, bite that Apple like Mac
That's that computer love
I kill that pussy
But I don't go to the funeral
Cause I'mma wear this ass out like a uniform
So ride this dick like a horse, pony, unicorn
She put her lips around the motherfuckin' hookah bong
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call

I said hello
She said oh shit
I ain't mean to call you
But anyway, what you doing
I said nothing
She said I know what you should be doing
And could be doing
Open up your legs
Walk me through it
Ain't too proud to beg, psh nigga please

And she fell on her knees
What you know about that?

Evil thoughts they run in my head
Get there, while you can

No you can't, Yes I can

Lil Wayne,"I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

Fatal attraction ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew there was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone
And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam

And it was like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's was like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair

But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do

Or will it end in tragedy

I swear that I was done
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse double back y'all
So you know I'm gonna have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all

Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy

Uh, I got a main bitch and a mistress
I'm trying to work it out, I'm on my fitness
Probably won't last, but I'm optimistic
One makes me happy, the other one makes a difference
I ain't a player, but I love a lot
She loves me, she loves me not
But it feel good, and it's not supposed to
I eat her insides, mm soul food
She put her head back, then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment like the time froze
Then my girl call, back to reality
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh!

Don't try me and if I dont do nuthin' I'm a fuckin' ball
And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw

[Chorus]

Ain't nothin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us
We hear them haters callin' they too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk
Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front
Southside I got what you want come holla at me

Lil Wayne,"And I don't walk around lookin' for it, you know?, But
Yesterday It Seemed to just wander on till it found me,
The gossip found me
Then why don't you just prove it.
How? You don't know how to prove it?,
Well, what you just do is

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop (Oh)
Stop, hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And you could get tipped
Like ya waitin' on a nigga, and
Put a body bag and an apron on tha nigga

I give my all behind the mic,
But you could never see, if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me, to win the title fight
But I'm gone wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is no light
I'm tryna be polite, but you niggas in my hair like the nigga on lice
My flow is rare, these other rappers nice,
These other rappers bark,
Some of em' even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light you just might, might, wanna

Think it over (think it over) Oo
Think it over (think it over) Baby

Stop, analyzin' critacizin',
You should realize what I am and start epidamizin'
Confident, got the heart of the biggest lion
Confident like fuck em all get on my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dyin'
It rains a lot in my city, cause my city's cryin'
Cause my city's dyin'
But I emerge from all of that, I am a livin pio-neer, sighin'
Fear God, not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the boot, and
Soo-woop
And, then I leave a tub in the boot, I leave a blood bath,
Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
Like the string of the shoe
No niggas want that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I build hip hop solely like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gone need g's if I'm bakin' the zeedy
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga, takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Eazy
Why do rappers, lot of rappers, lot of fans, lot of rappers, lot of rappers
Lie like actin', cut the motherfucker7 down
Cut the jack, fuck your props
I AM hip hop.

I can't help but wait, check it out 

I see you, you wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by, while he lies, then turn right round and forgive
I can't take, to see your face wit those tears running down yo cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true, because deep down I'm still a G

And I don't wanna come between you and your man,
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can

Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same (Can't help but wait)
Till you, see you, for what you really are (Baby girl you are a star)
And I can't help but wait

It ain't fresh, to just let him call the shots
Your a queen, you should be, getting all that someones got
You should be rocking the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional ""I love you"", ""I'm thinking of you""

Lil Wayne,"Where's my coffee?
Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)
Your first patient (yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)
Originality (ugh)
His flow is weak (another one)
And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr.carter to the rescue.
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break.
Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say.
All I need is one mic.
All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun-play like.
No kidding, no kids in the way,
But the kids do watch.
Gotta watch what we say.
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
Think I think I lost 'em

Good afternoon doctor carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lost respect for the game
Ah let me see
Think you can save him?

OK.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kid
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is frighting.
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it I've lost another one

Good evening doctor carter its been a long day
But this one looks much better then the others
His respect is back up
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is some swagger
OK let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.
Fly go hard like geese erection.
Fashion patrol police detection.
I stay tight like Chinese connection.
I stay tight like pussy at night.
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.
But I'm too wrong to write.
Too fresh to fight.
Too paid to freestyle.
Too paid to freestyle.
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice.
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.
I can only see flow.
His blood starting to flow.
His lungs starting to grow.
This one starting to show.
Strong signs of life.
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.

He looks good
His vitals are up
He's looking good
He's looking good
I think we got one
Doctor carter I think we got one
Yup we got one
We saved him
He's good
He's good
We got one
He's good
He's good
We got 'em
He's a go
He's good",Dr. Carter,

Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining
And I'm a still wear a smile if it raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad I got mine
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me

When I'm walking past the mirror

One thing bout raw, raw got swag
Raw hit the mall and I don't pop tags
Raw stay clean, raw stay fresh
You know those must be 87's in them jeans (i guess)
I Bought 'em in Miami ship 'em hoes up to Duval
Must of had 20 chicken-heads up in that u-haul
I move so smooth, cause them jack boys back track
Half a quarter mill in the brown Louie nap-sack

Flyin' with the rest of em X5
Still got my nike Boots
South side what up
Uptown What up
B&g what up
The revolution will proceed
Unification of the dmv I will achieve indeed
I decree I'm forming a new alliance
Oppose the one poisoning the minds
They lying
I am only a fighter
In the form of a writer
In the form of a poet
Potency in the mic
I blank out then I approach it
Turn me up and I go in
Haters learn to Bear
I'm Lovie Smith with the vocals
Lord I'm so focused more focused than I ever been
So slightly passed em, like the letter ""n""
It's DC, black jeans, black tee
This that North Face rap, WALE, you better get me
PG, Riverdale, Largo, Temple Hills, Cap Heights, 124, Landover, Everywhere
Saratoga, 640, Berry Farms, 1-4, KDY, every corner, everybody got em on
Flyer than the rest of em

no congressional reppers, no respectable rappers
It's the way we've adapted, don't forget I made it happen
The most opinionated city you can make it in
And still a nigga made it here
I'm Neo in the matrix
Knees dug deep into the pavement
DMV so we used to the waiting
Nobody seems to care we so complacent with the vacancy
See, the love is gone with one another, it's hard
Nobody rep for the skins, they busy cheering them stars
It's ironic, it's the same for the artists
Rather than buy our songs, they busy cheering the stars
A lot of drama
A lot of beef
We have so much in common, starting at the feet
Goadome Nikes, the cortazone of the poem writer
None like us
So none like us
Flyer than the rest of em

this where the haters is
This why they hate us here
This why I hate it here
Though love it, I made it here
We all here, from the dealers to the kids
To the squares to the fly
One thing we are aligned with
Black on black Nikes
That represent the lifeless lives
And it reflects the plight of those fighting so
If we ain't right and always at the throats
Of one another at least we got our Goadome Nikes a
Metaphor, for the insecure
If you ain't wearing no color, can't nobody say nothing
One can never be judged when he dress like his brothers
Melancholy we are though we all learn to love it
Pessimistic we are
Carry odds like luggage
And through all our troubles
We still walk around walk around
(flyer than the rest of em)
Flyer than the rest of em
Flyer than the rest of em

It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass

I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you
Have yo people wearing a rest in peace shirt of you

I said bust somethin, shoot somethin
You just talking I know you ain't gon do nothin
Pussy nigga (ya heard me?)
If you got something to lose, you gon lose something unless you do something

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in, and I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

Asalaam alaikum no oink fa me
An' I never let a d boy boink for free
Cause its Barbie bitch you can join the wave

You know you at the top
When only heaven's right above it
We on
'Cause we on

Who else really tryna f*** with Hollywood Cole?
I'm with Marley G, bro
Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know
This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow
And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get s*** confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them b****es find a pole
Plus I been sippin', so this s*** is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money, motherf***er
If you ain't runnin' wit' it, run from it, motherf***er, all right
Now somebody show some money in this b****
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this b****, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a f***, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you n****s know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the f***in' plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple-A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the p****
You n****s can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me

N, now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money, motherf***er
If you ain't runnin' wit' it, run from it, motherf***er, all right
Now somebody show some money in this b****
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this b****, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Uh, how do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman,
I bet that b**** look better red
Limpin' off tour
'cause I made more off my second leg
Ma'f***in' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you n****s in apartments
No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled at?
From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the f***in' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
But you know me, I get on this b**** and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, n****, nothin' short of that

With trophies up under they shelf, sky ballers, all kind of Benzes

And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat

Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinking liquor like it's water, getting pissy drunk
And staying away from them lil' broads that trying to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waste line
Ducking the law, 'cause I ain't trying to do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep trying

Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad

And my old lady say she saw me with another Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she tripping talking 'bout I need to be in church

Trying to put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep falling to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas melting away
Man they got clowns right around me, killing they self everyday
We keep fighting but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck

Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be bugging like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, trying to figure where I'm getting that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everything was cool I wouldn't write this damn song

What what what 
I'ma flosser baby 
Baller baby 
A fifteen year old shot caller baby

In a all black call 
Down Mercedes cool 
Got your wife at my house and she naked too 
And all my niggas all around us saying shake it boo 
Go ahead do what you do 
It's weezing darling off that heezing darling 
I', surrounded by the ice it got me freezing darling 
It's plain and simple 
My change and it's natural 
Now Wayne will pimp ya'll 
Got game from beatrall 
Trying to see six numbers 
At the Grammy awards with six hummers 
Me the Grammy award with six woman's 
Nigga stop at the gas station for six rubbers 
Put it together 
This is the night for you to get under the cheddar 
Don't try to end it or you wouldn't get better 

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Here I come star rapper 
I get the fast money 
Short cute hot boy 
And rap for cash money 
Stand out the roof of my car and flash honeys 
Take your girl to the mall and spend a gee like it's nothing 
If you lay on the floor 
Open up the spot 
Take off her draws 
Let me see the cot 
Don't stop 
Lil' Weez lil' weez and nothing nice 
But yet to my Jesus Christ 
Nothing but ice 
When they see me at night 
Behind Cristal see night 
Snatch your wife 
Run up in there with the K why 
It's all mine 
Ever since I was born Wayne 
Nigga get out of line I get dirty like John Wayne 
I bought something to floss it 
Whatever come with it 
Now don't shoot us unless they have a drum with it 
At first they weren't with it 
But then I was choking 
I got 'em all paying attention like they owe it 
What

Lil Wayne,"[Lil Wayne]
Got a early call from Kisha
Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but I thought eleven would be sweeter
Cause she wanted me to see her
Said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater
Left Ne-Ne with Macita
Vroom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how I'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak
They say she keep it cleaned up
But I don't want HIV brah
Take her straight to the sheets 
Her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said oh Kisha
This what I got to meet her
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro
Oh no I got to keep her
Told her I'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep
I got some more meat to feed ya

[Turk]
Now I'm hot
I wonder was up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call
See if it's alright
For me to dip through
She said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good
I'll be there in a minute
She didn't know I knew Wayne was already hitting it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog running out
He saw me dipping in but he didn't know what I'm bout
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Saying to myself look at this dog ass hoe
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got studio tonight me and the H-Beezey
I can't be late
I'm gone see ya when I could
Here's Juve on the hip
Let 'em know it was all good

[Juvenile]
Oh oh there she go
On the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know
We done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed
She told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cause she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smelling
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and now I said fuck it
Say boo I gotta ride
My baby momma beeping me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good and you have it not to telly

[B.G.]
Bitch hold on do I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walking out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on them bolls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinking and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standing tall
What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head
End up doing something bad ha

Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partner get lit up
And then they ask why
That's cause you played wit' me
They couldn't of known I'ma guerrilla
Drama stayed with me

Wha wha wha nigga nigga
I put piss stains on private planes cause its my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my rottweilers drink moet
Diamond baugette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost 3 nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got Benz, a prowler, playboy, and a Vette
Tell the truth--who fucked ya on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the noila to new york
Who got every bitch attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking bout, look, y'all don't know?
I'll give you a hint, see that bitch you with?
He fucked that hoe
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, its like Harlem world video

I told four I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing
These hoes doing ghella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20 inch chrome
Gimme the key, the car hoe, and the alarm
For my prowler, my jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20 inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the choppa is mine
Hit my block in my Benz hoe with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Ordered the tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the vc's and tv's so a nigga could shine
With my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

[Chorus 2x]

I ride the best from a Benz to a jag to a beamer to a lex
Might fly first class on delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a reppa
Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moet, and Cris
See that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring ya bitch around me
Cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different
That's ya issue
But after she come back
Your best out is not to kiss her
Hoes sick saying damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at BG watch
That bitch blingalingaling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 g's or better

Juve and Baby take the right

Cash Money millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga weezay said, we surrounded by ice

Now I'm shining baby glossing
Big tymin stuntin and flossing
Lamborghini sitting on broads
With two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari
With Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome
Vroom! sorry we lost 'em
I'm back
I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the hummer,
Hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jets about to land
The women fall out when I let em touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20 inch fans, damn
Got damn
Man I am

See where I'm from we keep our guns out
Dodging cops and burning blocks, cause we be thugged out
It's time to floss, two big bodies on Broad South
And they got quarter staffs and birds that run the house
It's all good in the hood hustling like illegal
Soon as you get it, hot skirt, like for them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggas murder on top, boy
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys
We don't know what being cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day til it's ""400 Degreez""
And you see where niggas go, nobody be on the pulpit
They got a nigga that own the sto', he flipping out off that broad
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure, your door is locked
Cause this ain't nothing proper, cause tha block, is just hot

(Nigga you got that llello?)
Well cook something nigga

See watch your step on my section, gotta walk like, talk like
Where they shot out all the street lights
So you can't see what nobody be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, cause we ain't trying to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggas been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playing wit
Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Catch your breath, now sh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggas that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Calling weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Call out for that caper, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up put em in the vans, then put a gat in his drawers
Tch, one move blow his cactus's off

(Nigga you got that llello?)
Well cook something nigga

Lil Wayne,"Look, where I go from here?
Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm coming man
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be running man
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son riding everyday on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And see Cita, Mrs. Rose, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra
Dog, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool living off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me

[Chorus: x2]
It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everything gon' be alright
I know it's hard trying to make but it's gon' be alright

Alright I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dog, things got wild
I know you probably saying 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby making millions now
So I still smile
I'm taking care ya wife bra
Ain't nothing changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Things go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who paying the bills now,
Still flossing, give my audience the chills,
I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thugging nigga, player you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, all a the Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me

[Hook]

I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me every time watching the boys shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thing make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul every time I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leaving all the love to me
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me

[Chorus: x3]

I mean it's up to me man
Just watch over me
And it's gon' be all gravy man
Leaving big, treating me all good
Everything else be all good
Rest in peace ya heard me

But I know she not like any other girl

She had a cowboy hat (what else), a sun-greased tan

Now I can tell that me and her are gonna make a baby,

I don't know why she's affectin' me
Or why this situation's stressing me
I don't know why nobody's callin' me

where I want it, and when I want it
And what I want
Somebody tell me what's going on, going on

Now it's time to make my approach
'cause its all most 2'o clock (bling, bling)
But I gotta do it now 'cause I'ma get mine when I hit the parking lot
She said I know your name, I know what chu do not

But I ain't gonna lie, yeah I wanna ride
So baby lick the spot

By midnight I'm a goner
So what your name is Sonya
(Spitting noise) bet I bone her
I'm going to get rid of this last bag of marijuana
So won't cha come outside with me
How bout chu take this ride with me
It's gravy so we hop in the no top, four dot
She fasten it like ""ooh this car is so hot"" she got
And we stopped over at the Ramada
And I got her to come out on that powder
And right jump on just swallow
And swallow and drain damn she wild
Make her trip out Lil' Wayne
Damn she loud, now
It's all over 'cause I'm finished with mine
I'ma tell her call tomorrow but then I be lying
But that's all in different baby
And pimpin' is me, hot boy Weezy-Wee what

Flippin' chickens, and movin' out quick
Hard-hustlin' 'cause we love slingin' this white s***
S.S., Monte Carlo's, hard-tops - we love that s***
'Bout two-hundred thugs with this clique

Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)

You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', ""Where's this bastard's crack?!!""
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, ""Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!""
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?

I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita
Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers

Me, Turk, Geezy, and 'Nile - chicka-POW!
How come these niggaz keep burnin the world?
and why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal Bentley drop
Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come

Mask the face, automatic attach to waist

There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib
while your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?

Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin? from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid

And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters 
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!

And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me want to beat a cop
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire

[Chorus]
Tell me what you like
Let me tell you what I like
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

Weezy the hottest
Drinkin' Barcadi
I stream through the scene on a Lincon on Robbers
Lookin' for the finest dime, To wine and dine

Later on I'm tryin' to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, Slow ya a** down
Pick it up, Throw ya a** down
Now throw ya a** around

An scream me name 
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame
Better watch that boy he nasty

I strap on a plastic
Break ya off like elastic
Put the dick in the middle, Make it wiggle for ya'll
Might be small, But that dick ain't little at all

I like a short thick broad, Fat a** an s***
Like Taso flip like Trina The Baddest B****
Matter of fact when I see her, Pull her Over like a cop
Juve coulda Backed It Up an I woulda Dropped It Like Its Hot


Ha Ha, Ya heard me
Ha Ha, Unplugged

[Chorus]

I like them big, round, yellow and brown
A b**** that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut

Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that n**** who got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, Hold up ???
My b**** got thong, You b**** got drawls

My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that b****
Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop
My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop

See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend
From vigina to the a**hole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever
Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome

You ok Lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love me dick

Lil Wayne,"I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father 
Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions

What it be like up there baby boy, 
Aye this here ya son hollerin' at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin', peepin down on how I'm livin'
Aye, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin'
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit 
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time 
That you caught me smokin' herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom 
And got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise

I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know

But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin' from nothin'
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin' at the way I treat these hoes and these 
Bitches,
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose C-M-B
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me

I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep

But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me want to grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin' on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""they's my peoples""
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know

Lil Wayne,"The block is hot, the cops is swarmin' a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin', with penitentiary chances

Fiends flock like ? come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuous

And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's

I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge 
Feelin' tha way you walk when you move yo booty applaud (damn) 

I gotta keep my composure 
I gotta untact my mission and handle bisness like a soldier 
Young man, young money but tha money long currency da hot spitta so grown 
And yo preception of me is so wrong 

Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds 
Might have done a lil dirt and left a few of them hurt 
But whatever has occured they all got what they deserved 
And you don't rock like that, um I can see it in yo eyes

And I'm suppose to be a player for life, but I'll change for ya

Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, ""Juvenile, stay off them streets."" 
I can't help, I draw attention, they be fuckin' with me 
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets 
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', ""Fuck the police!"" 
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east 
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself 
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health 
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck 
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up 
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's 
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed 
All they understand is my project English 
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga 
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga

And in my hood the laws are scared of us, we are too terrible 
If I live to be old, it's a miracle 
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical 
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo 
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you 
Don't blame me, society changed me 
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar 
Cut off lights, we masked riders 
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake 
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car for it cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice ""Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing""
I'm tryin' to see flying in a Lamborghini 
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini 
Cut the music down and tell her, ""hey ya man's a weenie""
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie

Pull out my bankcard and Bill Gates feel broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal

Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van,
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag

And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention 
all our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common

Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young n****, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
N**** it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me

Chorus
[Lil Wayne]
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, n****s that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
N****s can't hold me down, wodie wild
'cause all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
N****s got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But why'all gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone c***suckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

What?!
What?!!
Look?
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that 'cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
'cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real (??) like bag 'Bauds
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?

(Hook [Lil Wayne])
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Lil Wayne]
Look,
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me (??) without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Wheezy, nigga
It's Wheezy, nigga
Who? Wheezy, nigga
It's Wheezy, nigga

(Hook [Lil Wayne])
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Lil Wayne]
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who is Wheezy, nigga?
Who is Wheezy, nigga?
Wheezy, nigga

Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

These niggas neva thought they'd me tha ones that Mil'd shake down
Get a few crack spots and sell that bitch straight down
But when you ree up you to cut yo cake now
And when you see murder you know you got to break down
why'all bitch niggas thinkin life is a cut
Now you stuck watchin niggas fuck yo wife in tha butt
You was tha main thug up in tha club
Now you tha same thug suckin tha snub
Gettin back ties in yo tub
I kick murder every two bars
Pack two tars, when I cock I need two cars
Cause I stuff a trunk like a turkey
Keep a vest on that deuce deuce ain't gone hurt me
When I get tha drop I'll pop while why'all sprayin wit tha calico
Box full of bald heads, got why'all scared
Then hit tha block for why'all bread 
Cause when why'all post up i'm leavin why'all dead
Leavin why'all dead

(Beanie Sigel)
You know Mac that Philly cat wit tha official flow
Tha pistol will blow, especially if yo wrist on glow
Rocks in tha watch lookin like a disco show
Grab tha tool-a and put it to tha back of yo madol-a
Beanie Sigel dessert eagle quick to pop off ten
I only carry guns that knock off limbs
Give out (?) bags, lay on tha deck when I spray up yo set
Who you escapin tha Tec without trace in they neck
I know some dealers who be supplyin tha packs
I'ma guerilla but you can catch me where the lions be at
It ain't shit for me to ride out and tie up a few cats
Make them show me where they hide out and their valuables at
You can catch me in tha kitchen bout to break up somethin
Large block, coffee pot bout to bake up somethin
When I'm broke you can catch me about to shake up somethin
Wit that coke for a pound that'll wake up somethin

And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoe prints
Cause I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips

[Chorus]",Where You At,2002
Lil Wayne,"[Lil Wayne]
I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number 
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
Cause she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix, laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers don't know shit 
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)
Nigga please

[Chorus: x4]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good, I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard, I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life, the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend 
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody

[Chorus: x4]

You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
Cause all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you don't love them ho's
Love ya niggaz love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that

Tell you how I do it I change my leather
No stock Blackwood with the foreign feathers
And German eyes with them Gucci sweaters
Bought mami the matching shit and plucked her feathers
I wipe it down bitch bird lady forever
Birdman switch from Rees to leather

She was a raggedy bitch, switched her up, cleaned her life
You no longer a scrub you the Birdman's wife
So don't you think twice about this mink and leather shit
You drive by the hood and bird shit on a bitch
Drive anything you want cause you the Birdman's bitch
Get anything you need and you roll with the clique
Go to the club and get a front row seat
Pop mo Don P just shit on a bitch
See your fly now mami used to be a dirty bitch
Got all these hoes trying to ride your dick
You maintain mami you never just wild out
That's why Stunna put you in that big ass house

I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be
To hold me right now
Our song's playing

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Close to my body
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a roll
Like you work it, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever
(Oh) now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
(Oh) we tried to stand up
(Oh) hold me why while my hands up
(Oh) and the music picks up
Fantasies were shook up
I'm thinking to myself again

When you're not here (I sleep in your t shirt)
I wish you were here  (to take off your t shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t shirt)
Wake up in your t shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t shirt)
Wake up in your t shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Outside I hear the rain on my windowpane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that baby home
Why couldn't it be reality
Looked at the clock it says 4:03
At nine he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever
(Oh) now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing

Now she want to spend all night with me
(She want to wake up with Weezy-F baby)
Let me be the one that you throw it to, baby
(Throw it back ma, throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)
I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you

I'll take your bitch give her back, take your bitch again
Because you throw a five I pitch a ten
Now she want to get inside of my sixty six
She sees my wrist blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick (me)
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip (yup)
And I don't lie I confess, 
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though, 
Gotta stay clean, plus momma in a Lex four
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death
It's the bird man Jr. sincerely yours

And not a day go by us, 
We don't get higher than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone off we ridin'
Where phones don't roam they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleepin' in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds 
We can stare at the morning (yup)
But I can't be there all morning 
I'm a pimp, baby girl, I'm going, going, gone

I'm sorry I was grooving
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music
But let's get back to what we was doing
Laid back in that black on Pat Ewing's
That's thirty three V tires, he fire
These streets ain't papaya ma
You gotta keep heat on your side
Two must, so I'm a get three more and cop you one
Wait, naw hun cause you ain't exempt
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip (yea)
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip
And you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script (yup)
I said I stick to my grip, 
I stick to my money, 
That's life to me

And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click
And I ain't even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waiting for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to duck
Cause you my brother chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down

We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
Member B and Slim leaving, hand the ki's over
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunna

Put the laser on the 45 iron, stupid
One shot to remind who is the fly lil nigga that's behind the trigger
I am all chronic combined with liquor
You will never see me like momma tigger
An eighty's baby a fightin' nigga, I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I am something you call pepper like a viking snake
See me over the viking stove I am lighting bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out, I'm tighting clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting spliffs (I do this)
You catching my drift representing with my section on my belly and shit

So roll the carpet out, cause you fuckin' with a nigga from the royal south
See you are either in or you are out 
And if you out stay in 'cause  them warriors are out
Because those vultures, cops, and those lawyers are out
So I just open up the gate and let my holliers out
No nigga I never call your house I am probably some where taking Toya out
Not answer my phone and ignoring your spouse
She leavin' messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey, I am ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name, naw better yet point him out
Me and the streets got a joint account
I am from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans, wodie put the that in your mouth
And if we feed you with a lot of iron it will flatten you out
A few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never telling one another leave tht in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packing out
If I ever run into some trouble send my savages out
These niggas talking sweet I will get them cavities out
I got graveyard flowers man I am passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now
I am the prince

You got a gator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash
145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man
I spent my childhood in a wild hood
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G.
You want to overthrow me

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket

Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder

A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven

I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish

The twin cigs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And twenty dime bitches, to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
The boy's got at least six digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like ten bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggaz in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting I'm fine
I'mma have these dick sucking niggaz deep-throating the nine
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' off the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til they family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'mma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations

Yeah it is what it is, my niggaz just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket
I'm tryin not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
I work hard in the game, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all
And even overseas they accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars work success, it's my destiny y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
Screaming, ""Cash you don't know how sexy you are!""
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying ""What's up""
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spaying shit up
Prraat prraat.I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends can envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggaz will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die, but I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, guac-a-moola
I pop the ruger, send that hot shit through ya!
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggaz out here are playing fair
So before the odds are even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga I'm that shit, bitch!",6 Minutes,2005

Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D boy use to run into traps
Still a soldier do to war if you running your trap
About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the waller
It's the reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like

If your status ain't hood

Betta be street if he lookin' at me

That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things 
If you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street

Just might give one the phone tonight (Phone tonight)
Homey in the dickies in my zone tonight (Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight (On tonight)
Ooh he lookin' good and he talkin' right (Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life (Change my life)
Everytime he look at me my girls be like (Girls be like)
(That one may be the one tonight)

Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walkin' wit purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sargeant
Body marked up like the subway in harlem
Call him, weezy f baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryna hide
I blend in wit the hood, i'm camouflage
Bandana tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute
