Torres,"Knowing you were laundry-folding just outside the bedroom door, I slept near it
Knowing you would carry half the hapless buzzing of my dilated spirit

I know you never dreamed I'd become a damn Yankee
I need you to believe that I'm still your same baby

No feeling like finding a peach cobbler sunning belly-up on the granite
The kind that'll make your tongue slap all your brains out

I know you never dreamed I'd become a damn Yankee
I need you to believe that I'm still your same baby
I know you never dreamed I'd become a damn Yankee
If you could only see, it's still the Georgia winds that move me",Tongue Slap Your Brains Out,2017
Torrie Zito,"There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return",Nature Boy,2014
Torrie Zito and His Orchestra,"You must remember this 
A kiss is still a kiss 
A sigh is just a sigh

As time goes by 
And when two lovers woo 
They still say, ""I love you."" 
On this you can rely 

No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by 
*Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 

Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 

On this you can deny 
It's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die

I’ll just tell what’s in my heart

Life is beautiful

Life is like a dream

Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.

Or is he holding you the way I do?

Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet

You hear their engines rolling on

Delightful necessity
With no apology for my curves, my behind

Glinting surfaces mellow and moist

It explodes
'Til my cheeks turn all flush
And the flesh felt by hands, felt by hearts
Becomes pounding and red

Pure pleasure
No disgust
No disguised measure of quality
Pure appealing
No afterwards
Cleaning up
Nothing but
Summing up
Kisses and humming

Torun Eriksen,"Could have been a simple task figuring this life out
Could have been done research in so many other ways
Could have chosen a couple of different questions to ask
Spared myself the never ending stories
But then again I wouldn't have come across
Those who taught me about loss
And about not wasting time fearing the \""what ifs\""
And so I wouldn't have come to terms
With my paranoia for being stood up, for letting
Down and not reaching the point of what is

Does this sound like something I've said before?
Is this somehow familiar to you?
Going down the road just to find more beginnings around the bend
More stories to go through

And it feels like
I am alright
Alright
Putting things back into place
And now it does feel like
I am alright

Would have been a big mistake to stop before I started
Would have been the silky smooth but oh so unhappy way
Now would have fit right into being
The beauty without a beast
What is safe if there is nothing to be safe from?
Is it protection from something which is created from within?
Hide and seek will at some point end with game over
And so it's better to come to terms
With the fact that you might not win
That you might lose
But to whom and with whom are you playing?

So if she wasn't fucking with me I was stressing it
Wasn't no questioning, pussy was mine
Wasn't no questioning, Bonnie and Clyde
Still living in my momma house, but I let her move in
Momma thought I was tricking
But really I was just choosin', that was my bitch
I was claiming her when we was fucking
My bitch, wasn't using condoms no nothing
I was in love, she came first before my homies
Like fuck it, I'm 'bout to get your name tatted on me

Ain't really fucked with his crew
I did a summer with his brother
And she fucked with him too
All that shit she was talking
She wasn't really 'bout it
And it made it even worse
When my homie told me 'bout it
I gave you your swag, told you to dress like that
I hit your spot, made you say ""yes!"" like that

Reality, I hit it and she sad now
She pregnant, she know I coulda been a dad now
She text me like ""I love you""
I text her back like ""fuck you""
I looked down and looked up
Her best friend ain't shit cuz my best friend hooked em up
But she know a nigga rich now
She text me like ""I'm stylin""

You've got dreams, keep on dreaming

High school teen, never got accepted
Guess it didn't get to go how I expected
Now a nigga pissed, steady lookin' at the bottom of the list 
Like where the fuck re my projections?
Nigga's like ""Next year Tory
It's all good, you'll be next year's story""
Then I said ""Man, you don't even understand
Man, I'm droppin' out now, ain't no next year for me""
So I left, bus route to the bitch down 53
Took the last dollar that I had for this dream
And I spent it on some naughty nonsense, Micky D's
Shit, wasn't doin' too fine
Then I made a call to this nigga named Rhymes
Said he had a little studio and it wasn't top-notch
But could damn near do the whole nine
So I said ""Cool"" made a few songs in this shit
Stayed too long in this shit
But by the month, I was there so much
Nigga's had to lay futons in this shit
I was in my mom's Susanne
Drove to my first shows in a new Jetta
Always said one day I would be the man
I would just laugh like, who are you tellin'
Me, I'mma go far
I can still dream in this world full of stars
I can still scheme in this world full of narcs
If they can still scheme and I'm on my car show
I'mma dream, I'mma dream, dream
I'mma dream dream like you said to me

Ten long miles, from a long way home
I'm headed downtown cause I'm workin' on this lil mixtape
With no fillers, no throwaway songs, hopin' that this shit just go
Sadly for me, this shit didn't
So I make another mixtape and another mixtape and another mixtape
'Til them nigga's start sayin' shit's hidden
Then I meet a guy named Sascha , he tells me he's thinkin' 'bout takin' up management
Say he got a million dollar empire on his mind, he just need an artist to plan it with
He also say he throw shows out in Texas and maybe I should open up for one
Then I say cool man' he books me the next flight out like I'm showin' up for somethin'
I lay down Houston around nine, warehouse live
Was my worst show ever, nigga's damn near got boo'd off stage
I performed my first live show ever
Women in the crowd would scream for a nigga
Nigga's in the crowd they was ? up down
Bad enough nigga's let Bun B watch
But I feel like I let Sascha down, shit was live on stage dawg
That night felt like a nigga had the whole world on my shoulders
Twenty years old tryna find the one spot in this world gettin' colder
Then he came to me like, dawg, I could put money on this, bet a hundred on this
Gives me a few tips for the next night, set list says dawg you can run it on this
And it all works out

Don't let no body fuck up your high

Father, I lift up my son
I lift up anyone that travels with him and by his speed I pray that you go ahead of him
I assign angels right now to this assignment
And I declare Father that they will go before you to make straight his path, 
I command that every crooked path would be made straight, every rough place would be made smooth
Every obstacle, every barricade, every blockade
Every conspiracy, every trap, right now is destroyed and removed out of his way in the name of Jesus
And I thank you that it is written that goodness and love and mercy, form all the things of our life

That was it, I had hit rock bottom, lowest point of my life
Just me, the music and a couple quarters in my pocket
Then it hit me, the phone call that would change my life

My shawty had an abortion for me like three times
As hard as that to say that to y'all, I think it's much harder to keep it silent
I hide emotion behind the face that's devoted
To only winnin' this race and this pussy, money and violence
How could I be so selfish and need this time for myself?
Needed time for your health, to recover, I'm on some other
I'm out there sellin' soaps to these fiends, hopin' for dough for more myself
It's twenty three like is that the hope for myself
'Cause if I never have a kid again, I be pissed but I deserve it
I been cursed with all these man made ways
And this earth that I been livin' in
Sorry for the present problems that I put you on and get you in
Follow God, take my soul if I can't, play my role
'Cause I know what I'm doin', it ain't right, it ain't wrong
But it make decisions, takin' life, just take away a life
'Cause day and night, I pray to Christ and I hope you'll forgive me

Hopped off the phone with my dad, niggas barely do speak
But I'm sending Western Union wires every two weeks
I got a brand new brother and sister I never do see
He might call to send me a blessing to tell me do me
But shit, I been doin' me since fourteen
Four court cases, court scene, four courses, called clean
Corner boy fortune, a fortune to dope fiends
That got a nigga cuffed in the court with these lawyer fees and
I just felt the game callin' me, ay
Felt like Mitch in paid in full and the world they gonna pay me full
Dropped outta school and teachers just called me fool
Packed the black bag up and back up on my bull
You always told me these problems would soon catch up to me
And shit is catchin' up and fuckin' me up
Fourth quarter hustlin', I'm 'bout to sell a three up
If the D comes, I'm gone, pop, please forgive me for this song cause I understand

I really contemplated killin' you
Grippin' the clutch and throw aside this pistol in my hand
Used to be my fam dawg, you used to be my man
It's only outta respect for your mama I say your name, but I care look
Niggas that say they love, they wanna kill you
This feeling's feelin' familiar, I felt it for way too long
Feelin' like the villain, you felt was way too strong
It felt like jealousy was just weighin' in on your dome
Should've cut ties, man I should've cut ties
Lord please, Lord please forgive my young eyes
I was young and unwise, I was just so naive
I was trying just believe, I was trying just perceive
But them niggas, they was greed, they was livin' outta greed
Now I'm livin' out the dream, cookin' kitchen outta steam and
You gotta feel me, I messed up on a yacht
Lookin' filthy, that's why they do not feel me, ya dig?

You say that you love me
But you still out in these streets
All that hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
Lead to nothin', nothin', nothin'
It's time for you to leave

Hey Tory, it's me
I just wanna let you know that I'm walking away from the situation
I just feel like I've tried, I've tried and
I just can't get through to you and
I feel like you love this lifestyle more than you love me
Just pray that you take care of yourself and be safe out there

I'm really eating, I'm ordering more extra size, you know me
Round the block, glovers spittin' them hot flows

At the Clearport customs, I barely show my credentials
Don't need a tinted, I want you to know who's in it
Had me offended last time that I walked in the hall, went through
Let's break it down for 'em
Account this, if every show is a 100 thou' for him
Then that mean, a hundred minutes on stage will equal a 100k
That's one thousand a minute

Who wanna witness my nigga, I'm really sick with the shiznit
I brought big Poppy out at the SumFest
Sean Kingston watched it from the side stage
I made triple the advance that he had gave me in my first year, 45 minutes of me on stage

And I'm not amazed
I think the table's turning
I think you learn from the bridge you burn when you see it burning
I think you learn from the world when you see it turning

I only brought a couple niggas with me
The beef was finished as soon as we took the picture, the world was watching
The attention in the industry started shifting to me
Lord forgive 'em, Lord forgive 'em, I was tripping all the time
I spit subliminal, dissing just tryna rip shit
Not realizing if I took the time to kick it, and me and Drake
Mend them bridges would probably equal to winning
Got the hard head flow, money coming in so thick
Them niggas call it hard bread dough
I'm in this all red four seater, I'm leaning like the '06 fours
I said I'd stop freestyling but fuck it, oh well
A nigga flow so well, I'm like a sampling kit
Give a fuck 'bout who get pissed about by samples and skits
Niggas mad I'm remixing their shit
Fuck out of here, nigga, stop being a bitch
I think it's time we cut the silence by niggas that's talking violent
Speak of silence and give 'em coffins and violins playin'
R&B niggas with Sisqo haircuts, wildin' and stylin'
They dissing, guess they just tryna go viral, I feel 'em
This your favorite song, this gon' be your favorite song
Except when I say it, it's really the people's favorite song
You did a vid diss in a flex R8
I could've flexed a 'Rari or Wraith, but nigga, I ain't
Instead, I bought my house the other day and flexed in the paint
Real estate, I'm property shopping, bitches probably watching
Got the Gadget-Go flow, Nobu and So-Ho

Blood drip stain the ground, bug it down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip, letting off
Somehow we end up in the same shit

And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Brooklyn murder lathers a birth place
Facing the city, quoting Biggie all on our worst days
I used to take the train with her so none of these lames give her the danger
Living from where she was at was a plain picture
I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen, she just kinda blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured out, everybody wants riches and them cars
But she just wanted a better family
Because her parents divorced early, her papa, he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe us
Then she gave her to her uncle, her brother played the saviour
Until the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fucking up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothes
And forcefully started choking her, telling her not to move
'Fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years, this night was a repetition a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem exit or quit it, the feeling was there
Started talking lower and she told me, ""Come here""
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with the aim to kill
And said, she don't fuck with niggas, 'cause niggas is the reason

He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure
He told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and hours in notice to find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt, it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know 'im
But take this pardon
When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
The woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him, don't ever let no nigga or woman touch her
And if somebody do, then all they would hear is the baka baka baka baka
One day, he was on the block rolling
Then, this crack fiend woman came up to him and told him
That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, ""Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye, came from when you was four, from when you fell off in the road""
At that point, he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
She says to him, ""I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind, was pressing, I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you""
His mom says to him, ""I hope you know your pap was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop, but everything I'm saying fails
You see, your lil' cousin out in Brooklyn will be relieved
I know she love you but the story's more deeper
Uh, you see, your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
Used to leave her, so confused, she would lace an old poke and reefer
Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been living this mission
You tryna figure out who's the nigga or the perpetrator of killing your pops, nigga
When your cousin is the reason, he got shot nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga""
This anger was dwelling all on his mind
He didn't know what to do, he started gripping his nine and uh
Before he knew, he aimed it up at his momma and uh
He shot her right in his spine, he said
""This is why, my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in trying?
This Glock on my side, if I put it to my ma
I know that I'ma die, but in Heaven, I'd be alive""

Only did what I'm supposed to do 
I don't know how I been such a fool for love-n-you 
It never really mattered too much to me 
I guess I was too blind and I could not see 

The message in the words that I heard you say 
Hmmm, that you're unhappy and you think you need some time away 
These things just happen but I know they don't happen that way

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light

Toshiko Akiyoshi,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1994

It is seldom that a dream comes true,

I'll do my best to make him stay.

I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not,

Is it the way that I twist my big hips,
That mak the bad boys all flip the script.
I get my mini-skirt,
Look into my eyes then I lick my lips.

When I'm in my room I need your concentration,
I climb on my bed, open my legs... ejaculation.
Then I lay back to get in the perfect situation,
You know what I'm saying, never keep a girl like me waiting,
Don't keep me waiting.

Bet she can't do like I do it,
'Cause when I do I throw my back into it.
And if you doubt me then let me prove it,
'Cause I can turn you out.

[Verse Two:]
When I'm on the phone I like to talk nasty,
You can call me late at night, tell me what you want to ask me.
What am I wearing, what is the color of my draws,
In my bed, I'm your girl, I hit you with the yes-yes-y'all,
Yes-yes-y'all.

Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the zootie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (uh-huh)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
And just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby whether you do or not

Baby won't you take the time (the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(just because I'm yours)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)

I'm comin out the mission like the great Santana 
So now I'm gettin hyped I want to be like Mike 
And never met a female that I didn't like

And if their man steps up then I'm quick to shoot

Cause I'm hard like a rock tearin up the block 
With a 9m glock and a ten foot cock 
Produce dope hits I love big tits 
Plus I'm all that and a hot bowl of grits 
Weigh a buck and three quarters 
So fathers hid your daughters 
Cause I'm runnin through them like my name is Ricky Waters 
I'm a dip and groove and do a spin move real smooth 
But I ain't got shit to prove 
Gettin love at the pub like Sam Malone 
And I make a bitch moan when its time to bone

No fear here! I Sing and bring it.
In Christ you've got no right livin' timid.
He's light in the dark and hope for the wicked.
There's a land of the dead called planet earth
And a race called man walks dead from birth
And the beast and man both bear the curse.
Come from the womb but retrun to dirt.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall over come.

Here's what I do I hope I get through.
So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.
These kids smoke weed, these kids that drink beers
Who don't want to hear what you got to say
And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
But I was empty.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall over come.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall overcome",We Shall Overcome,1999

It just depends on the way you feel
Big chances worth a try
Keep on moving faster, 'till you fly

I know you better now, but still there's not enough
Please find a way, to fuse your thoughts with your actions
If I get closer, will you fly in my direction
And if I'm asking for a sweet dream to come true
Then please tell me what to do

Give me one moment your mind, give me reason to shine

Is this the way you wanna be, the world you want to see
Give me one moment your mind

I wanna your love, but I don't want to borrow
Have it today, and give it back tomorrow
You're making me feel so incomplete, when you're in silence
Begging my patience, don't let love turn into violence
I miss the talk that I've been looking for long ago
Make my ice melt away

Give me one moment your mind, give me reason to shine

Is this the way you wanna be, the world you want to see
Give me one moment your mind

Even up to this day
What is it you wanted from me?
What kind of game did you play?
Your split personality
Has turned me inside out
You promised honesty
But gave me lies 'n' doubts
You told me you loved me
But all my trust you betrayed
I lost my dignity
Why did you take that from me?
You told me you wanted me
I don't need none of that crap
You took it all out on me
I felt abused - I was trapped

[Chorus:]
It is so easy to go
And cut me with your ego
I cannot take no more
What did you do that for?

Now you've got no place to go
You will hear me on the radio
I am worth caring for
What do you take me for?
I took you by surprise
You didn't know what to say
You could not look in my eyes
Your conscience got in the way
Don't act pathetic 'n' dumb
'Cause now it's much too late
Justice will be done
I've got no time to waste
You stole my smile from me
And left me stuck with your shit
My body still remembers
All the things that you did
You didn't hear me cry
But now it's time that you know
How much you've hurt me inside
It's much too easy to go
You messed up - all your chances you blew
The game is up

I'll save my love for someone else!

I'll say goodbye
And walk away from all this pain inside

Help you through all your fears
Now you're telling me that you have to move on
When I needed you the most you let me down
Won't see my tears, our love has gone

repeat chorus

I don't understand how good love can go wrong
Must have been a lie that I laid
All my hopes ard dreams upon

You came into my life
And you made it all happen
You gave something good
You gave naturally
And nothing can change
The love that we started
It's a moment of truth

You always have been a true friend of mine
I never thought that we would cross that line
You kept on pushing my heart, trying to open my soul

And suddenly loving you feels so right

And now I realize,  all I wanted was you
And nothing can change the love that we started
It's a moment of truth

La primera de estas mentiras es el propio nombre: piratería
Es algo habitual en los medios de comunicación jugar con el lenguaje
Ustedes lo habrán visto
Utilizan eufemismos para suavizar ciertos problemas graves
Y utilizan también exageraciones para convertir en
Problemas graves lo que son realidades para nosotros inofensivas
Por ejemplo, en cuanto a los eufemismos
Es habitual que ya no existan las guerras sino las intervenciones
Militares donde hay efectos colaterales
Que son esos que saltan por los aires sin saber de qué va la
Cosa cada vez que hay una incursión aérea
¿Es casi poético eh?
Una incursión aérea
Ya no hay paro en el paradisíaco mundo del
Eufemismo, sino que hay tasa natural de desempleo
Ya no hay pobres, sino carentes
Ya no hay ricos, sino que los hay pudientes
Políticamente correcto es como se llama al lenguaje que utilizan en
Los medios de comunicación
Es como se llama en realidad al disfraz que
Usan las palabras para salir en televisión
En cuanto a esto de los eufemismos
Es curioso porque cada vez que leo los periódicos me siento mucho
Menos preocupado por mis problemas,
Porque ahora sé que mi economía no se va al garete como pensaba
Y no que simplemente está experimentando un crecimiento negativo
Es decir que crece
Pero que crece para abajo, crece en la dirección incorrecta
Y los ricos que me roban por el camino para que eso sea así
No son ladrones sino que son cleptómanos
Que se enriquecieron por un golpe de suerte
Que es como decir que se enriquecieron como por arte de magia
En cuanto a las exageraciones ocurre igual y tiene el mismo objeto
Que es cambiar la percepción que tenemos de la
Realidad, y es ahí donde aparece en escena la palabra piratería
El hecho de que se establezca una equivalencia moral entre las
Personas que se descargan discos de música en internet y las personas
Que asaltaban los barcos, mataban a la tripulación, la asesinaban
La saqueaban, la violaban algunos
Los más viciosos, eso obviamente no es una casualidad sino que lo que
Se pretende es que una palabra así, piratería, c
En tantas connotaciones negativas
Ya te esté dando una pista de lo que debes pensar
Porque es complicado enunciar una frase como ""yo estoy
A favor de la piratería"" sin que suene a demencia senil",Interludio Osr,2005
Tote King,"Los golpes no entienden de nada 
Solo de poner la razón del revés
Los jueces entienden de leyes
Pero según donde, se entiende al revés

Una lágrima se entiende igual al derecho que al revés

Las guerras esconden el hambre
Los desprecios del color del metal
Lo negro parece importante
Tanto que no saben cómo parar

Y los llantos se entienden igual, por delante y por detrás

Por más que el sol, por más que quiera yo
Por mal que te parezca, por más que quiera dios
Por más que no, por más que buenas son
Aquí manda el dinero y luego el corazón
Por mas amor, hoy todo va al revés

Las armas se pagan con armas
Las batallas con la fe del que va
Las cortes esconden verdades
Tantas que al final las tendrán que adornar
Y las noticias llegan si al final, las mentiras van detrás

Por más que el sol, por más que quiera yo
Por mal que te parezca, por más que quiera dios
Por más que no, por más que buenas son

Que esperar me desespera

Tú mi premio, más sincero

Otra vez, te contaré
Los golpes que te van diciendo
Que llevas parte mía dentro
Que juntos sumaremos uno

Tote King,"Porque en realidad necesito mantenerme siempre tal como estaba al principio
Que cuando empecé a escribir
Donde no me, no me preocupaba nunca el riesgo
Porque si un libro iba mal no, no pasaba nada
Porque han ido, habían ido mal los anteriores
Y el riesgo es fundamental para poder ser libre a la hora de escribir
Y no estar pendiente de lo que has hecho antes, ni, ni de que pueda fracasar el libro

Ah, pensar en dejarlo, mi idea recurrente
El T.O.C., perderme
Ser un Bartleby sin banco
Olvidar el folio en blanco
Fantasear con la idea de no escribir más
Y dejar de ser una sombra de la realidad
Si lo analizo fríamente
Creo que en total hablo más solo que con gente
Perdiendome la vida pa' contársela al de enfrente
En mi cárcel con sus tres comidas
Sin ser un matador ni un Mario Kempes
Y me imagino abandonándolo, inservible
Buscarme un curro físico que sea cierto y tangible
Salir de mi burbuja de líricas enfermas
Currar a lo Lester Burnham
Y en mi descanso, pesas y fumar hierba
Y esta claro que sí sé con certeza
Que la peor de to's mis compañías siempre ha si'o mi cabeza
La hija puta me da letras que me han pagao' un palacio
Y sin embargo siento que dentro el tiempo mata despacio
Y no sé si me equivoque de curro
Podría haberme dejado esas orejeras de burro
Seguir el signo, acabar el CAP, buscar un empleo fijo
Y ser una mierda de maestro pa' el inútil de tu hijo
No puedo evitarlo siento celos
De la aura de alegría que desprende el camarero
Mi oficio me ha dotado pa' alegrar tus días tristes
Pero jamás podre confeccionar sus chistes, créelo
La gracia que no me han da'o, el sol que apenas valoro
Comparalo con estar encerrado en mi estudio grabando coros
Día tras día la impotencia me llena
Pensar que na' de lo que he escrito hasta hoy es mierda buena
Comprar el pan y descubrir la belleza
El color de al lado, melocotones y fresas
El puzzle gira y yo ni sé cómo se llama mi pieza
Los codos ennegrecidos siempre clava'os en la mesa
Ni mirando mi lista de emoticonos más usa'os sé quien soy
De dónde vengo, a dónde voy
Un dia siento que mi rap no tiene sustancia
Y otro dia que yo le hago al rap el rescate de Bankia
Aún así pensar en dejarlo, pensar en dejarlo
Ideas en bucle sin sentimientos como Lorne Malvo
¿Cómo le digo al manager que se ha acaba'o?
Si estamos en Enero y hay seis festis confirma'os
Tiro pa'lante como siempre y te vomito
Las canciones que ya has escuchado diez años en tu equipo
Si tú estás cansa'o, imagina yo que a veces las recito
Y olvido la letra por pura supervivencia ¡Chico!
Ya no sé ni lo que quiero pero sé a quien quiero
Entre el cielo y el infierno, tú lo más bonito
Hoy me mola esta mierda y mañana ausente
Esto ya ni es rapear, es arqueologia presente

Pensar en dejarlo, buscarme algo
Donde nada esté a mi cargo y mi mente a salvo
Me he vuelto loco, eso ya es un hecho
Me he comido mi cabeza y una mano en el pecho
Pensar en dejarlo, toa' la vida escuchando
¿Qué te pasa Tote? ¿En qué estás pensando?
Estoy valorando esta locura
Esta impostura me esta matando

This is real life
I'm liking the show
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
I be blowing up spots like I was sending out mail bombs
Hold me down at all

Y veo esto por el norte y sur
Te dicen ""¡Lucha por tus sueños!""
¿No se podrían morir los de Mr. Wonderful?
Y que resucitasen Gila y Eugenio
¿Te sientes mal? Te venden aire
Ineptos consumen
Los mismos torpes que en Streetfighter no les salía el ""Hadoken""
Te han vendi'o tres mentiras y han entra'o en tu cama
Dime una puta música que no sea urbana
Monetizan tu pena con dos chistes
Exige tu derecho legítimo a estar triste
Porque hacen pasta en autoayuda edulcorada
Hablando el idioma que mantiene los esclavos a raya

No existe un todo sin un caos
No hay subida sin bajada
En este estado de tristeza
Mi creatividad se dispara
No hay lugar para tanto número 1
Ser especial pero girando el rumbo
Seré quien marque diferencia
Porque me sobran unos kilos
Y mi cara no es perfecta
El éxito también es aceptar
Me equivoqué, que lo luché, no lo logré
Serás más libre cuando disfrutes del proceso lento
Ya no sabes mirarme a los ojos
Lo ves todo a través de un cristal
Ser feliz está en lo puntual
Así que llora cuando tú quieras llorar

Prefiero el pesimismo de Céline que la caspa de Reverte
Y amar la vida en realidad es amar el disfraz de la muerte
Y el que sonríe positivo no madruga a las seis
Estar enfadado es un regalo como decían los Rage
Ese coach te quiere enseñar pero está amarga'o en su kel
en su pack es seguro que no tendrá Jazztel
Memes de Buddha y de Coelho mintiendo
Cuando encienden la estupidez se me apagan los pensamientos
Qué mal te queda esa sonrisa estudiada
Qué bien te saben los consejos de estética
Dicen que el hombre inventó la electricidad como un bien
Yo digo que lo hizo solo pa' poder usar la silla eléctrica
Chavales estafados buscan a Dios
El corazón de hacendado, sentimientos lowcost
Les dicen que todo es posible, que lo luchen al cuello
Y cuando no lo consiguen, los culpables son ellos
Que no te engañen con sus mundos de flores
Porque eres del montón, sin la genética de Julia Roberts
Para estos coach nunca existe la suerte
Con discursos más repetí 'os que la Estrella de la Muerte, bro

Dicen ''¿Por qué no cantas, Tote?
¿Por qué no te pasas a otro rollo?''
Les digo ''Porque aquí libero el estrés, hermano, aquí libero el estrés''
Esta canción está dedicada a todo el que está hasta la polla
(¡Tote!)
Libera el estrés, libera el estrés

Toteking, el más duro de cualquier school
OG, leyenda, más gallito que la Red Bull
Volando con los gansos del Grey Goose
Dejándote a ti el micro del playskool

Es la entrada del carro del César al Coliseo
Eras mi fan, ¿ya no te gusto ahora?
El tiempo no va pa' atrás y ya no me puedes deschupar la polla
Lo consigues, Dios escupiendo la verdad
Está lloviendo mierda, entiendo lo de tu bucket hat
Vente conmigo, asociémonos pa' pecar
Estoy dejando un legado que nadie va a tocar
Qué triste están to' los raperos y yo
Solo suelto lágrimas por un puchero, yo
Soy el papi, el jefe, el don
Me escuchó Enrique Iglesias y se cortó con el drone
Cuando escupo esta mierda, libero el estrés
Levanto al boli de la siesta, libero el estrés
Hasta mi sello me pide canciones con menos barras porque no pillan ni tres
""El contenido no importa"" me dicen unos cuantos
Qué casualidad, los mismos que hoy están cantando
Me dicen: ""Vente al pop, Tote, aquí lo pasas bien""
Le digo: ""No, mi música es pa' liberar estrés""

Si estás hasta la polla de ese jefe tan cabrón
A tu niño le hacen bullying, tranqui, nos lo han hecho a tos'

Libera el estrés, libera el estrés
Libera el estrés, libera el estrés

No dudaría ni un segundo y mandaría al talego
A tos' los que hacen el mono en los campos de fútbol
Allí libera el estrés la escoria del mundo
Vente conmigo, hermano, si has perdido el rumbo
Desde mí aclaro que hay que estar en la calle
Pero no sigo a nadie como Kanye, como Carter
Sube el pan, primo, cuando enciendo el Avalon
Indiscutible hermano, como el Goya de Álamo
En cada letra hay un libro que dice: Yo el rey
No hagas coreografías raras, pareces el OA
Entro en tus beats y suena to' okay
Tú ven a los míos y vomito como si leo a John Gray
Me indigna alguno que propone el crowdfunding
Y ese público que paga el crowdfunding
Es quién quiere pelea pal' título y no está ni en el ranking
Y son más malos que mi disco ""El lado oscuro de Gandhi""
Tus héroes tienen caspa, chico, ya sé quiénes son
Los míos tienen gafas, Royce, Elphomega, Íñigo Errejón
Soy el capo, miro a esos rapeos
Y estoy en tos' ellos como Dios o los turistas japos
Cuando escupo esta mierda libero el estrés
Levanto al boli de la siesta, libero el estrés
No he nacido pa' ser esclavo
Porque pongo todo lo que soy en lo más mínimo que hago

You don't understand me, that's your trouble
Not my fault because you don't understand me
I don't understand you either
But I don't spend my whole life tryna put the blame over on you 
Because my cigarette didn't light
Or because some didn't work, right?
Why you wanna call me a murderer for?
I've never killed anyone
I don't need to kill anyone

Te echo de menos compi, desde el centro de mi corazón
El mundo ya era triste cuando te fuiste y ahora está peor
El barrio es un chiste, solo hay derrotas en el marcador
Pantallas negras, miradas bajas, frío y calor
El tonto del Inda sigue haciendo el soplapollas por La Sexta
Y el señor Montoro ha vuelto a hacerme otra inspección de hacienda
Los Gasol están que se salen los dos
Y en la casa del libro, en el top, hay un tipo que no es escritor
La gente está que da boca'os desde el lunes
Y los retrasaos de tú país lo han
vuelto a hacer y han vota'o los azules
Y ahora hay youtubers que por dos chavos
Increpan peña por la calle o saltan rascacielos y tejados
Tontos por to's lados
Tontos colocados que engrosan las bolsas de enchufados
Listas de imputados
Mamá está bien, también los hermanos
Y yo sigo fuerte gracias a tu charlas y donde las dejamos
Sabes si alguien va triste si va sin megabytes
Las putas ya no hacen la calle ahora hacen clickbait
El disco del año es un truño y la peña se lo da
Y los otros medios se suman por no quedarse atrás
Putas y cobardes
Medios que publican noticias que no
son ciertas por miedo a ponerlas tarde
Velocidad de vértigo en la ciudad sin ley
Donde el único cuerdo es el puto Luís Ikey
Si vas a hablar, que algún moderno te asista
Conspiranocias lo ven todo machista
Pa' tí y pa' mí era sencillo, eran to's iguales
Hoy te tachan de antiguo, y pansexuales
Los días pasan to's iguales
Y yo recuerdo, me dijiste, que no llegaría lejos
Y los tontos de Podemos ya están pelados entre ellos
Y David y yo nos mojamos, pa' esta ocasión histórica
La puta izquierda y su puta enfermedad crónica
Tus opiniones marcá's en mí como graba'os
Registrá's y gardá's en cada mail que me has manda'o
Voy a continuar esta enseñanza por mi la'o
Y a leerme cada puto libro que me has recomenda'o
Mi curro bien, sigo bien, mi público es fiel, estoy contento
Ellos saben que no tengo rival escribiendo
El hermano bien, con su león, no pierde el tiempo
Y las dos Lolas son pa' hacerle un monumento
El humor negro que heredé es parte de esta historia
Por eso escribo esta carta y no un tema moña
Como hubiese hecho el puto ciento por ciento
De esos cerdos incapaces de mi gremio
Voy a predicar con tu ejemplo
Qué fácil es escribir cuando no estoy mintiendo
Podría tirar por la basura que esperan pero sería una vergüenza
Como hacerle un estribillo a esto
To' el barrio fue a despedirte, el respeto
Que algunos ni conocíamos sus caretos
To's lo entendían, como tus chistes
Voy a seguir a Luka Doncic como me dijiste
Voy a echarle dos huevos

Por eso quiero días lluviosos, pa' que no veáis mis lágrimas
Hermano, estoy hablando desde arriba
Mi repertorio es Diego Armando pero con rayas de Adidas
Chico, me escondo de la vida y a veces ni basta
Porque se rige por la regla de la todopoderosa pasta
Y al final te encuentras gastando como estoy
Pese a que sé el tiempo que pueda hacer mañana, aunque no soy Floyd
Sabes que estoy rodeao' de toys
Que van a morir sin saber machacar como Billy Hoyle
Matando muñecos, protegiendo el cuartel

Tote King,"Soy el mayor de 3 hermanos en esta familia de artistas
Criado en el amor de dos pares que no hay parido tronistas
Un amor como el de ellos nunca más vi por el barrio

Y como quería lo mismo, las novias me duraban dos telediarios
Vinilos en casa siempre, fue con el radio
De los Pretenders a Dylan, o al Born on the Bayou
Sosprechando de maestros sabios y sus mentiras
Vi un flyer que decía: Puedes ser lo que quieras en la vida
El Basket era mi vida
Tirando el balón al techo, tumbado en la cama soñando con la primera liga
La pandilla me arrastraba al protocolo del morado
Y el primer disco de los Rage barriendo pal' otro lado
En las gradas cuatro compis, mi novia con cara sosa
Saliendo de resaca al campo, ese números séis
Estaba claro ya que yo no iba a ser el nuevo Garbajosa
Con Barranco todo fumado, escuchando el ""Killing in the name""
Poco después una parienta me dijo: Estás loco
Nada nuevo, mis colegas lo decían también
Así que como un loco fui a buscar los míos
Me di una vuelta al parque, vi una graffiti y allí los encontré
No es por frardar, pero entré rápido en le juego
Normal, con Juaninacka al lado aparende hasta el más torpe
Mi voz duraba media hora y se piraba luego
Pero mi timbre es fuego y ayer y por entonces
Entré de lleno en el rollo y al carajo el deporte
Buscando un corista de guía y un Dj de soporte
Sin un manager no giras, me decían con orgullo
Y La Mala me salvó, me dio el número del suyo
Concretamos fecha y me lancé a la carretera
""Tu madre es una foca"" conquistando España entera
Abrimos el Viña a las cinco, con toldo sol que pega
Y había gente hasta el final, hay vídeos que lo prueban
Los puse a votar luego, ""Matemáticas"" y ""De votos""
El ""1 contra 20"", ""Mentiras"", ""Botines rotos""
El ""Ni de ellos"" fue lo más, aún hoy la disfrutáis
Si supieran que saqué la idea de un anuncio de Sprite
Por corte no hice el vídeo: fallo, cosas que pasan
El ""Ahora vivo de esto"" fue un vacile, guasa guasa
El personaje se ha comido al rapero, decía gente
Querría verlos a ellos cobrando 10000 con 20
Llegaron las redes y me dije: No está limpio
Aquí se vende humo, más humo que un telegrama indio
Ya no cuentan canciones hermano, ahora cuenta el pack
Vídeos que están por encima del nivel de raps
Hice un tema pa' contarlo y me salió todo mal
""El lado oscuro"" el disco más flojo de mi arsenal
Me pillé una depre más dura que todas las críticas
Y me repuse en dos años cuando hice ""Mi política""
El ""78"", lo último que hay de mí
Y pienso dar por culo hasta que muera como Lemmy
Yo voy a estar en el juego siempre, como Jigga
Y mientras antes lo sumas, antes reanudas tu vida
Mi plan es simple, rimar saben, llegar a mi kely sola
Y con ellos follo tan dentro que son palabras de alcoba
Le pego a beats tan fuerte que entran en coma
Cuando te falle algo, sabes, esto te soluciona
Y no soy un kie, ni chungo, ni un rompebragas, chaval
Tan sólo un rapper que se hizo un nombre con su estilo de rimar (ba ba)
Mandando frees por el audio del Telegram, feel it
Escupo y ya le gusta le gusta el rap al puto Bruce Willis
Pero este país es mierda, y no recuerda
Y currar con Orozco me costó controversia en Wikipedia
Te diría algo de vuelta cuando me tiraste hace tiempo
Pero lo pienso y está feo hablar de los muertos

La leyenda a los Sonny Chiba
De verdad, ten cuidao' conmigo
Con 40 Vince Carter te hace el molino
Criao' en los '80 escuchando Heavy
En San Pedro más ciegos que Daredevil
Empecé como to's con ""El rimadero""
Abriendo litros con el mechero
El vieja escuela más en forma
Me quieren dar propina
El vieja escuela que te mata
Como Morgan Freeman
Tienes celos que te hacen daño
Yo líneas en la mente pa' veinte años ¡Prrah!
Los mejores me han tatuado
Tengo en los brazos el Museo del Prado
Clásico del juego, estoy tachando palos
Dime De la Tno he orre, José Coronado
Yo tengo las llaves de la ciudad, compadre
Aunque no me las haya dao' el alcalde
Tú escupe pa' cuatro con tu modo padre
Yo escupo pa' todos, yo no tengo target
Eso ya lo sé, no puedes enseñarme
Lo he leído todo como ""El indomable""

Para bien, para mal, estamos juntos en esto, así que
¡Sube, sube, sube!
Me da igual quién seas, me da igual qué creas, solo

¡Sube, sube, sube!
Pa' mi ciudad y toas las que están en el ruedo
¡Sube, sube, sube!

Pa' to' los freakys y perdedores

Estoy rodeao' de expertos en meter la gamba
Llevo la pasta de su alquiler en mis bambas
Y  en la gira que hago con 2 caciones
Hay más queso que en tus macarrones
Me la suda tu puto barrio
Aquí somos de Rosa Rosario
Tirando triples con el parque apuesto
Escribiendo barras soy ambidiestro ¡Woh!
Yo no salía más que tú, porque pa'mi salir era muermo
Pero esos días que salía, yo sabía que sin esfuerzo follaba más que tú hasta con la ropa que duermo
Como siga España así la gente aquí no va a vernir ni para hacernos, una escala en el aeropuerto
La misión de mi música es sacarte de la música y hermano
¡Creo que ha llegao' el momento!
No sigo pautas, no sigo ejemplos
Viejo y chulo como Dan Hendo
Haga lo que haga, nunca voy a ser normal
Y qué mal me sale cuando lo intento
Ya no te hablo de mis días de gloria
Ya no te hablo de celebrar la victoria
Así que mira mi nivel de hoy, no mi trayectoria
Porque todas mis historias están grabadas en tu memoria

Tote King,"Tus dedos pulgares son esclavos

Y si yo fuese la colabo
Bro, no entraría después de esto

Yo, el que no tiene na' tiene tiempo pa' buscar el hobby
El que tiene to' tiene el Rolex y mira el tiempo en el móvil
Si el tiempo pone al hombre en su sitio, ¿Cuál es el mío?
¿Y por quién reza? Hay nieve en mi cabeza y no es por el frío
Contratiempos, al tiempo nada es resistente
No soy Damián Szifron pero esto es ""Tiempo de valientes""
El tiempo nació en el '72 con Nick Mason
El lado oscuro de la luna, Walters y Gaymore
Deloreans, sillones, cápsulas surcando el viento
El hombre jugando a ser Dios, máquinas del tiempo
Jordan, Ali, Steve Jobs violando el templo
Confirmando que el hombre es Dios algún momento
Niños tomando mierda corriendo hacia el tiempo adulto
Adultos como Bruce, buscando el tiempo perdido
Es broma y también drama como ""Tiempos modernos""
Y el puto Maldonado habla de un tiempo sin sentido
Tus pulgares gastan tiempo que es oro sobando el níquel
No me hables de tiempos difíciles si no eres Dickens, bro
Aún tienes tiempo de acabar lo que empezaste
El tiempo está vivo, solo muere en el Basket
Ricos y pobres usando el tiempo distinto
Durante un tiempo, porque el tiempo del entierro es el mismo
Tengo tiempo para ti, nena, y to's tus episodios
No tengo tiempo pa' la envidia ni el odio, no
De paso cuento que estos tiempos no los rimas como yo

Soy los recuerdos que conservo, soy lo que estoy haciendo ahora
Decían que el rap estaba muerto hasta que Arkano rapeó 24 horas
Este juego sin mí es Cindy Lauper sin ""Los Goonies""
Soy más real que hacer free sobre el ""Times up"" del O.C.
No tenéis gracia aunque tengáis mucha calle
Escucharos es peor que la Kardashian con la cami de Slayer
Me miro al espejo y ¿Sabéis qué veo?

Me parto la polla mientras prendo un filly

Porque son la Leti y quieren al lado un rey
En días marcados, contento en el barrio
Me fumo esa green y me llaman All Day

Era suyo hasta que yo llegué a lo King James
Solo seré feliz si el ser humano
Se extingue antes de que saquen otra Play
Y el free de tus ídolos estaba okay
Pero el primer free lo soltó Cassius Clay
Querían poesía y versos pero no saben medir lo básico
Y su merienda de las seis es el papeo de un mes de un clásico
Tus compis me cuentan, te toman a chiste
Te follo en tu rollo, en el mío no existes
Diez años de fajos
Lo tuyo son Blisters
Cuando no llegan, te tiran, se enfadan
Conspiran, lo típico, siempre protestan
Enfádate con tus compadres que no te dijeron
En serio en su día que apestas

And madly I said: ""I love you.""

You steal my love

You fooled your mother when you skipped ballet
To paint your face for the midnight show
And in the morning you knelt beside your bed
And prayed she'd never know

I feel so far away
It seems like I felt this before

Sun burns my skin
I can't live with pain anymore

Thinking of all that we've said
Were they just words
We'll live to regret
Why won't you stay?

To make me fall apart
Could this be love
Or just a broken heart
How do you feel
When you see me cryin' again

Is love at an end?
What makes us wonder why?
Rearranged
Just pretend

In the middle of a dream
Woke up in a pool of sweat
Thought I heard a scream
Ran over to the window sill
Stuck my head out for a peek
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognise
Running down my back street
My heart skipped a beat

[Chorus x2]
You better watch out, there's a stranger in town
You better watch out when he comes around
Don't make a sound

The morning paper and the head-lines read:Danger to the queen
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up
The son of a bitch is mean.
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job
Acting like nothing's new
Scotland Yard's still looking for him
But he doesn't leave
A single clue

[Chorus x2]

You better watch out

Who's this man who fell out of the sky?
What's he done and where's he live?
How can a man who's a criminal be a hero to the kids?
The old couple swear that the Riper's back
They say it's him all right.
The young girl says it's Jesus and he won't be back again
Tonight
I wonder who's right ?

You were runnin' down the road, I was going your way
You stopped and turned around, and lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering, I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart, I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart, like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart, had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start, and all my tears belong to you
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh

I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains
And loss of lives mining white man's gold

I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories are bought and sold
I know the city would surely be saddened, if what I knew could be told

So many letters and still no news
I hope you find all the things that you're after

Fighting to stay alive, can no one see the tears in their eyes

Where do people go when they're lookin' for that one of a kind

Why don't we make believe that we're sorry
Why must we hold it all inside
Where do lovers go when they're runnin' and there's no place to hide

Always remember, the day we met in the foreign rain
You were content and, we went our separate ways
No matter which way the wind blows now, hang on to it anyhow
Don't ever say it could never be the same

[Chorus]

Always remember, holding hands on a summer day
You were content ob das stimmt?? and you took it all away
I didn't come here to change your mind, lead you on and waste your time
All alone in the evening, gettin' blue

Why don't we make believe

Then you send out invitations
And address them with his cries

I can say
That you put up some kind of fight

Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps

Toto,"Smoke and mirrors
It's a house of cards
Everybody has windows
And big cigars

The law of the jungle
Is very new to some
The animals are vicious and arrogant
And they eat their young

I used to work my job from 9 to 5
I just survived

I was the king of the world
I had every thing thrown at me,
That the judge and jury could hurl
I was the man of the hour
I would claw and scratch my way up,
To the very top of the tower

Helter skelter
It's a den of thieves
Sea of errors
That a greedy man weaves

A few really bad apples
Always spoil the lot
Rolling blackouts
On everyone's block

I go to work and try to make ends meet
My life is over

I was the king of the world
I had everything I needed,
I owned every type of girl
I was the man of the hour
I would claw and scratch my way,
Up to the very top of the tower

I was the king of the world
I had everything I needed,
I owned every type of girl

Toto,"Everything's gonna be alright boys, help is on the way
Hold your head up high now, there's no need to cry now
We're not running anymore

Leave the politics behind boys, they're not working anymore
There's so much more at stake here, it's make or break here
Haven't we been here before - tell me what we're waiting for

Chorus:
You gotta remember, you don't have to be afraid
You still have the freedom to learn, and say what you want to say
You gotta remember, don't let 'em take away
The land we call the home of the brave

Who sings the song of the people, you don't hear it anymore
I heard it late last summer, to the beat of a different drummer
It never sounded quite like that before

So you're trying to shake this feeling, that trouble's right outside the door
You lie awake each dark night, like a time bomb wound up too tight
A storm in waiting, just offshore - tell me what we're waiting for

Chorus repeats 2x",Home Of The Brave (Encore),2014
Toto,"It's a feeling, I don't belong here
But a man's on the outside looking in, wondering who's in his old armchair

It's a feeling, you never belonged to me
First you're on the up 'n up, I only look down and see
Only look down and see

You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from mee

Toto,"Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

Bridge:
It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them
Someday I'll be over you",I’ll Be Over You,2016

Get the widow on the set!

Sei anni sono già del vento 
E mangio musica e frittelle 
Amo la luna, amo le stelle
Mio padre con la tromba in mano
Mia madre ascolta piano piano
Da grande voglio inventare 
Poesie e canzoni da cantare

Musica do re mi re do si la sol

Musica do re mi re do si la sol

Toto Cutugno,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had",Africa (L'Ete Indien),1998
Toto Cutugno,"Tu sais, je n'ai jamais été aussi heureux que ce matin-là
Nous marchions sur une plage un peu comme celle-ci
C'était l'automne, un automne où il faisait beau
Une saison qui n'existe que dans le Nord de l'Amérique
Là-bas on l'appelle l'été indien
Mais c'était tout simplement le nôtre
Avec ta robe longue tu ressemblais
A une aquarelle de Marie Laurencin
Et je me souviens, je me souviens très bien
De ce que je t'ai dit ce matin-là
Il y a un an, y a un siècle, y a une éternité

On ira où tu voudras, quand tu voudras
Et on s'aimera encore, lorsque l'amour sera mort
Toute la vie sera pareille à ce matin
Aux couleurs de l'été indien

Aujourd'hui je suis très loin de ce matin d'automne
Mais c'est comme si j'y étais. Je pense à toi.
Où es-tu, que fais-tu, est-ce que j'existe encore pour toi?
Je regarde cette vague qui n'atteindra jamais la dune
Tu vois, comme elle je reviens en arrière
Comme elle je me couche sur le sable
Et je me souviens, je me souviens des marées hautes
Du soleil et du bonheur qui passaient sur la mer
Il y a une éternité, un siècle, il y a un an

Soy lo que dejaron
Soy toda la sobra de lo que te robaron
Un pueblo escondido en la cima
Mi piel es de cuero por eso aguanta cualquier clima
Soy una fábrica de humo
Mano de obra campesina para tu consumo
Frente de frio en el medio del verano
El amor en los tiempos del cólera, mi hermano
El sol que nace y el día que muere
Con los mejores atardeceres
Soy el desarrollo en carne viva
Un discurso político sin saliva
Las caras más bonitas que he conocido
Soy la fotografía de un desaparecido
La sangre dentro de tus venas
Soy un pedazo de tierra que vale la pena
Soy una canasta con frijoles
Soy maradona contra inglaterra anotándote dos goles
Soy lo que sostiene mi bandera
La espina dorsal del planeta es mi cordillera

Un desierto embriagado con bellos de un trago de pulque
Para cantar con los coyotes, todo lo que necesito
Tengo mis pulmones respirando azul clarito
La altura que sofoca
Soy las muelas de mi boca mascando coca
El otoño con sus hojas desmalladas
Los versos escritos bajo la noche estrellada
Una viña repleta de uvas
Un cañaveral bajo el sol en cuba
Soy el mar caribe que vigila las casitas
Haciendo rituales de agua bendita
El viento que peina mi cabello
Soy todos los santos que cuelgan de mi cuello

Porque el abono de mi tierra es natural

La operación cóndor invadiendo mi nido
Perdono pero nunca olvido, oye

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow

In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl

Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day

Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

Touch Acoustra,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,2003
Touch of Faith,"You and I began as a simple melody
Through joy and pain, we've grown into an endless symphony
And now the time has come for me to take your hand and say
""With this ring I thee wed, with this ring I thee wed""

With my heart and soul,
I give you all my love and my whole life
On this special day,
We'll both be known as husband and as wife
And who knows what lies in store for us,
But I know this much is true
This love song began when I met you

As you walked down that aisle
I reminisced through all the years
How you showered me with love
Took away all my fears
And I remember when I looked in your eyes
And I knew you were the one
And because of you this love song has begun

I know that this love will last
You know that I'll stay true
With God as our witness
I give my life to you...",Love Song,1996
Touch of Jazz,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2001
Touch of Jazz,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Five foot two, covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Betcha' life it isn't here

So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Touch of Jazz,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2001
Touch of Jazz,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

If your heart is in your dream

Their guilt will hang on them for just today

All alone you sit, the phone never rings
Each day new sorrow brings
And the holidays, they come and they go
But there's one thing that I know

Even though my family counts me for dead
I never see them anyway
My life to God is not a worthless mistake
He's right there with me in my endless heartache

Can you look away from all this pain
Or do you think it isn't there
Can you look away from all this pain
Say you just don't really care

As we lock our priceless heritage away
Our kin the elderly
Do you know someone who stares at the walls
I think you know what to do



",Twilight,1995
Toussaint McCall,"I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you

I read your letters one by one
And I still love you 
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh nothing
Takes the place of you

I, I write this letter
It's raining on my window pane
I, I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same

So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
But I'm all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing takes the place of you",Nothing Takes the Place of You,1998
Toussaint McCall,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

2nd Verse:  I knew the time would come,
I'd have to pay for my mistakes,
I can't blame you for what you're doin' to me girl,
even tho' my heart aches.
Your dreams have all come true just the way you planned them,
so I'll just  step aside, I'm gon step aside and lend a helping hand then.

'Cause I could never make you unhappy, no I couldn't do that girl,
only wish  I didn't love you so, makes it so, so very hard to go.
(Backgrounds-So very hard to go)
'Cause I love you so (backgrounds answer-so very hard to go)
Oh, I love you so (backgrounds answer again-so very hard to  go)

Tower of Power,"So you want to jump out your trick bag
And ease on into a hip bag
But you ain't just exactly sure what's hip
So you start to let your hair grow
Spend big bucks to cop you a wardrobe
But somehow you know there's much more to the trip

[Chorus]
What is hip?
Tell me, tell me if you think you know
What is hip?
If you was really hip
The passing years would show
You into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
But what is hip?

So you became part of the new breed
Been smokin' only the best weed
Been hangin' out on the so-called hippest set
Being seen at all the right places
Being seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied
Still it ain't quite right

[Chorus]

Hipness, what it is!
Hipness, what it is!
Hipness, what it is!
And sometimes hipness is 
What it ain't!

You done even went and found you a guru
In your effort to find you a new you
And maybe even managed 
To raise your conscious level
As you striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
What's hip today
Might become passe",What Is Hip?,1986

Try your luck in Vegas
Shoot nothing but craps
But I'll gamble on my lady
When my luck's running bad.

Cause she's my lady luck
She must have come
From heaven above
Now she's my lady luck
My good luck charm
A winner at love.

Look for your pot of gold
Try to make the clock turn back
And never get old
Rolling seven's and eleven's
'Till the dice grow cold
But I'll always be a winner
With the luck that I hold.

Tower of Power Horns,"Well here comes the story baby that I want you all to know,
Bought what brought me down, what got me feeling low,
Started off one day and took off down the road.
Seeking' my fame and fortune, and trying to tote the load.

One man's loss is another man's gain.
One man's pleasure is another man's pain.
I left my woman in Jacksonville and took off down the line.
She had her way of thinking and Lord knows I had mine.
She could not take the pain of me not being home.
Couldn't take the pain, baby, of staying all alone.

One man's loss is another man's gain.
One man's pleasure is another man's pain.
Now when I left this town it was for her and for me.
Now I'm home all alone, with a paper that says I'm free.
I guess I'll hit the road again, and do what I do best.
To hell with her, to hell with him, to hell with all the rest.

One man's loss is another man's gain.
One man's pleasure is another man's pain.
Chorus:
One man's loss is another man's gain.
One man's pleasure is another man's pain.

Towkio,"You and your friends watch videos
Try and dance like Beyoncé
You was raised a church girl
Now you always find yourself out on Sunday
And do on Monday the same thing you did Tuesday
And Wednesday feel the same
Now you feel uncool like your auntie husband
And you don't wanna feel that lame
But you don't know that much
But it's okay go pour that up
If you got your drink then hold that up
'Cause you ain't pay for it 'cause you got a big ol' ass
So somebody bought it
You ain't gotta pay that back
I'm like, each night and it don't get old
But just know everything that glisten ain't gold, so
Don't believe everything you've been told
Just know that your future ain't sitting in stone like
Rolling Stone, I rock like granite
Hit the stage, rock the mic like Janet
If I say things they might just happen
Turn stock to seeds I might just plant it up
With no ring, just a Saturn, whip
You used to get your son from baby daddy (uh)
I ain't judging beauty pageants but
Time ain't never moving backwards
So, okay get this infamy
I just feel all the vibe that you sent for me
If God sent me an inquiry
About angels
And instantly you fell outta the sky
With a pair of some angel wings
Would you believe in the thing called destiny:
So would you live for me, or die for me, or sin for me
Or play along baby girl like a symphony, I'm like

Would you live for me?
Die for me?
Sin for me?
Cry for me?
Baby, if I wrote you a symphony
Tell me, would you play along? 
(Come on! Ay, play along! Ay)
Tell me, would you play along? (Come on! Ay, play along! Ay)
Tell me, would you play along? 

Would you live for me
Die for me?
Sin for me?
Cry for me?
Baby, if I wrote you a symphony
Tell me, would you play along? 

I said
Play along play along
Look, it ain't that hard
Don't act too cool, play your part
And if your card decline and you claim fraud
And if your man's there then he gon' take that charge
But if it's never your fault then it's never your fault
If you don't got money, you can say that thought
And you ain't learn a thing, now you pay back loans
For that diploma that sit on your wall at home (damn)
So who you owe, what you own?
You say you grown but I can't tell
Pop out, best fit you gon' put it on
But you still out here takin' them big L's
Broken nail, crack the screen
Worked at noon, slept 'til 3
At the club you risked it all
'Cause you stayed there 'til they turned the lights on
Looking for that love and basketball (like why?)
Really, no, I'm just saying
You be looking for the right things in wrong places
Make a man catch chills from your body language
At this point get lost in translation
Like damn, know they got it in for me
I can feel all the vibes that you sent for me
It's scientific chemistry, you wifey
Wifi, you connect to me
So let me be the Adam and you be Eve
But really girl I'm just trying to feel you're energy
So would you live for me, or die for me, or sin for me
Or play along baby girl like a symphony, I'm like

Would you live for me?
Die for me?
Sin for me?
Cry for me?
Baby if I wrote you a symphony
Tell me, would you play along? 
(Come on!) Play along
Tell me, would you play along? (Yo)
Tell me, would you play along?

If god sent me an inquiry
About angels that he missed consistently
And then you fell out of the sky with some angel wings
Would you believe it was meant to be? Huh? Like

Ooh, baby it's your move (Play along, play)
It's your move
Tell me what you want to do
Let it out, so, tell me what you want to do

Townes Van Zandt,"Well, the diamonds fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
The brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes

Well, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
And caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea

Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
When her image comes dancin' the sun she turns sullen with shame
And the birds they go silent the wind stops his sad mournful singing
When the trees of the forest start gently to whisperin' her name

So as softly she wanders I'll desperately follow her footsteps
And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sight
Ah, they promise eternally that she lays hidden within them
But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye

So the serpent slide softly away with these moments of laughter
And the the old washy woman has finish her cleanin' and gone
But the bamboo hang heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong",(Quicksilver Daydreams Of) Maria,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"You live on your hill so high and so lonely
You toss out your bread crumbs to those down below
They think you're a king, but, believe me, it's only
Because they're too blind to know

There once was a time when your money had meaning
Your diamonds had glitter, but now it's all gone
It poisoned your laughter and muffled your singing
You can't even see that it's wrong

[Chorus]
Your castle is dingy and dirty and dismal
Your carpets are faded, your walls are all gray
There's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal
All your young servants have drifted away

So go back to your sadness, go back to your sorrow
And I'll make my bed on a hill 'neath the sky
And lay here a-listening till the sun comes tomorrow
Counting the tears that you cry

[Chorus]",All Your Young Servants,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"Why does she sing
Her sad songs for me,
I'm not the one
To tenderly bring
Her soft sympathy
I've just begun
To see my way clear
And it's plain,
If I stop I will fall
I can lay down a tear
For her pain,
Just a tear and that's all.

What does she want me to do?
She says that she knows
That moments are rare
I suppose that it's true
Then on she goes
To say I don't care,
And she knows
That I do

Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong.

She'd like to think that I'm cruel,
But she knows that's a lie
For I would be
No more than a tool
If I allowed her to cry
All over me.

Oh my sorrow is real
Even though
I can't change my plan
If she could see how I feel
Then I know
That she'd understand

Oh does she actually think I'm to blame?
Does she really believe
That some word of mine
Can relieve
All her pain?
Can't she see that she grieves
Just because she's been blindly deceived
By her shame?

Nothin's what it seems,
Maybe she'll start someday
To realize
If she abandons her dreams,
Then all the words she can say
Are only lies
When will she see
That to gain
Is only to lose?
All that she offers me
Are her chains,
I got to refuse

Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied
She likes to pretend
It's something that she must defend,
With her pride
And I don't intend
To stand her and be the friend
From whom she must hide",For the Sake of the Song,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"[Chorus:]
It's many a fine lady has laid down beside me
With their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rain
Some tried to hold me, to hurt me, to hide me
Some turned away, not to look back again

One stood among them, I remember most clearly
Her sorrows were heavy, and her laughter was slow
I courted her gently, for I loved her most dearly
And I came her majestic reflections to know

Her words, like the mountain, stood lonely and lofty
With her face like a daydream and her hair like the shawl
Worn by a mourner, who steals away softly
From those that would have him mourn nothing at all

Endlessly sorrow rode high on the north wind
Slashing and slicing to take him his toll
Endlessly creatures of darkness were cutting
Their paths through the walls that shelter the soul

No longer gypsy-like sadness unending
Her eyes - they lie hollow and her face petrified
Some will go laughing and others condemning
But who there among you could have told her goodbye?

[Chorus]",Many a Fine Lady,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"When the bandits have stolen your jewelry and gone
and your crippled young gypsy, he's grown tall and strong
and your dead misconceptions have proven you wrong
well then, princess, where you plannin' to turn to?
when your magazine memory has spun you around
and you realize your lovers were just painted clowns
and outside your window you start hearing sounds
where they're building a cross for to burn you


when all your bright scarlet turn slowly to blue
will you stop and decide that it's over?


When your teardrops go sour and no longer fall
the splash cross the virgin that lives down your hall
and spends all her nights with an ear to your wall
well then, what will you have you can offer?
When the firedancers finish and leave you alone
with nothing but embers and sacks full of stone
that hang round your neck, slicing through to the bone
will there still be place for your laughter?


As your shattered illusions come a-tumblin' home
and all of the butchers you've nourished have grown
and they are suddenly able to leave you alone
and they run like slaves that are set free

and your mind starts to screaming that you ain't the one
that once dwelled within you, will you turn, will you run
Then princess, will you come home and get me?",Sad Cinderella,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew
Fairest skin with eyes of blue
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true
It's a year now she's been gone

Her spirit was as bright as the soft sunshine
Lips the color of strawberry wine
I wish to God she still was mine
The chance won't come again

After first we lay in love's sweet bed
With one look at her eyes I might have read
All the pain that was flying through her head
Through my guilt I could not see

I turned to her when the morning came
Hungry thoughts racing through my brain
But the knife in her heart screamed herself she'd slain 
And a note whispered love too soon

Her old man screamed and her mother cried
All I could do was to wonder why
A girl in her youth was forced to die
Is loving such a crime?

She died (few in the years) with breasts still small
Seeing sixteens summers and fifteen falls
Me and my blindness never realized all
The fear she kept inside

I swear to the Lord that I loved her true","Sixteen Summers, Fifteen Falls",1968

Well, I ain't very big for twentyone
and it seems I never could have any good clean fun
cause every time I'd go outside some great big bully'd come along
he'd hit me in the face and he'd knock to the ground
and he'd start kickin' me all around
and that ain't exactly fair, friends, that's wrong.


So I got me a paper the other night
and I crawled up on the sofa and I turned on the light
and flipped through the pages till I found the classified ads.
Said, ""take karate from Lee Hung Chow;
man, make your first appointment now
this course is guaranteed to make you bad.""


Well, the next day I drove to the address
by japanese design I was really impressed
it looked like a regular house of the rising sun.
I walked inside, I was all alone
I had a nervous feeling down in my bones
I was kind of sorry I'd ever even come.


Then a giant jap came through the door
he must have been about seven foot four
and he looked like he's prone to easy aggrevation.
He said, ""Lee Hung Chow, Ah kee dung""
that's japanese for fee fie foo fum
I tried to explain my entire situation.


He said, ""Number one course, yankee, self defence,
twohundred dollars and twentyfive cents"";
I said ""What's the twentyfive cents for?"" and he said, ""Repairs.""
I said, ""Repairs to what?"", and he said ""To you""
and I thought to myself ""Man, that won't do""
felt about a half inch tall under that ol' slender stare


Ah, you think he was yellow...


I said, ""I believe I better go check another place""
he said, ""Ha so, Yankee don't like my race""
I said, ""Now, there's a mistake, man, and that's true;
I've been for you you japanese all along
you japanese just can't do no wrong
and I thought you got mighty dirty deal in World War II.""


Well, he grabbed me by the hand and gave a heave
I figured there's a pretty good time to leave
before he had a chance to do me any definite harm.
But my plan worked out in the end, you see,
now no bully is gonna pick on me
who's gonna hit a fellow with just one arm?",Talkin' Karate Blues,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"The name she gave was Caroline
Daughter of a miner
Her ways were free
It seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her

She came from Spencer
Across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'cause the coal was low
And soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she'd come
To look for work
She was not seeking favors
And for a dime a day
And a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied
Her pa had died
The word come down from Spencer

So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man
Returned again
To lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died
Was a note that cried
Fare thee well
Tecumseh valley

The name she gave was Caroline
Daughter of a miner
Her ways were free
It seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her",Tecumseh Valley,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"By Townes Van Zandt
I'll play upon my violin
Until the mountains ring
Of lonely laughter blindly thrown
And cause an endless sark of strings
The skies are sad
They're dancin' to a silent symphony
And the velvet voices all shall join
The singing

The hall is filled to every corner
By a tinkling hint of chimes
A melody careens and crumbles
Leaving just a trace behind
A rhythm [palter and] faintly fails
The silver on its wings
And the velvet voices all shall join
The singing

The cymbals flash, the drums they crash
The trumpets rise the song
The brass beton plucks its diamonds
From a glittering wall of almost dawn
The crystal chords they slash the wind
In humble majesty
And the velvet voices all shall join
The singing",The Velvet Voices,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"Sometimes I don't know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin'
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just waitin' around to die

One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just waitin' around to die

I came of age and I found a girl
In a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, bought some wine
And hopped a train
Seemed easier than just waitin' around to die

A friend said he knew
Where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and brother did we fly
The posse caught up with me
And drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years I've been waitin' around to die

Now I'm out of prison
I got me a friend at last
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie
His name's Codine
He's the nicest thing I've seen
Together we're gonna wait around and die
Together we're gonna wait around and die",Waitin' Around to Die,1968
Townes Van Zandt,"Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine
Though you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine
That's got you to feeling this way, but I don't care,
I want you to stay
And hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today

Children are dancin', the gamblers are chancin' their all
The window's accusing the door of abusing the wall
But who cares what the night watchmen say
The stage has been set for the play
Hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today

The moon's come and gone but a few stars hang on on to the sky
The wind's runnin' free but it ain't up to me ask why

Just hold me and tell me that you'll be here to love me today",Be Here to Love Me,1969

But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway
Maybe I'll go insane
I got to stop the pain
Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen.

A swallow comes and tells me of her dreams
She says she'd like to know just what they mean
I feel like I could die
As I watch her flying by
Ride the north wind down to see Kathleen.

Stars hang high above, the oceans roar
The moon is come to lead me to her door
There's crystal across the sand
And the waves, they take my hand.
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.

Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.",Kathleen,1969
Townes Van Zandt,"Her face was crystal
Fair and fine
Her breath was morning
Her lips were wine
Her eyes were laughter
Her touch divine
Her face was crystal
And she was mine

If only she
Could feel my pain
But feelin' is a burden
She can't sustain
So like a summer Thursday
I cry for rain
To come and turn
The ground to green again

If only she
Could her my songs
'Bout the empty difference
'Tween the rights and wrongs
Then I know that I
Could stand alone
As well as they
Now that she's gone

Her eyes were laughter

Townes Van Zandt,"My home is Colorado
With their proud mountains tall
Where the rivers like gypsys
Down her black canyons fall
I'm a long, long way from Denver
With a long way to go
So lend an ear to my singing
'Cause I'll be back no more

I left as a young man
Not full seventeen
With nothin' for company
But the wind and a dream
'Bout all the fast ladies
And livin' I'd find
When I left my proud mountains
And rivers behind

So I rolled and a-rambled
Like a leaf in the wind
Well, I found my fast ladies
And some hard livin' men
Well, I sometimes went hungry
With my pockets all bare
Lord, I sometimes had good luck
With money to spare

I made me some friends, Lord,
That I won't soon forget
Some are down under
And some are rambling yet
But as for me
I'm headed for home
Back to high Colorado
Never more for to roam

So friends, when my time comes
As surely it will
You just carry my body
Out to some lonesome hill
And lay me down easy
Where the cool rivers run
With only my mountains
'Tween me and the sun

My home is Colorado",My Proud Mountains,1969
Townes Van Zandt,"My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon's dancin' purple
All through her black hair
And a ladies-in-waiting she stands 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon
On the false and the fair

She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
Her skin fits her tightly
And her lips do not lie
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
Slowly she twirls it
In front of my eyes

I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her
The satin she's wearin'
Is shimmering blue
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping
My dogs have gone hunting
The howling is through

So I reach for her hand and her eyes turns to poison
And her hair turns to splinters,
And her flesh turns to brine
She leaps cross the room, she stands in the window
And screams that my first-born
Will surely be blind

She throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
She's parted her lips
But she makes not a sound
I fly down the stairway, and I run to the garden
No trace of my true love
Is there to be found

So walk these hills lightly, and watch who you're lovin'
By mother the mountain
I swear that it's true
Love not a woman with hair black as midnight
And her dress made of satin
All shimmering blue",Our Mother the Mountain,1969
Townes Van Zandt,"You're wakin' next to me
Tears splash across the sun
You whisper soft to me
That I ain't the only one
To breathe your yellow hair
Caress your bosom fair
Do you think I really care?
Do you think it matters?

What do your feelin's mean?
Do you think I'd love more
If you stood pure and clean
Of those you'd known before
Would your words be sweeter then
Upon November's wind
If you began again
Could your smile be softer?
Would your eyes more brightly shine?
Would your laughter be so tender
If you'd been only mine
For as long as you remember?

I don't want tears from you
Don't build your love on shame
All what we've done is through
And all we can do remains
My lady can't you see
I love not jealously
But for all you are to me
And all you'll be tomorrow",Second Lovers Song,1969
Townes Van Zandt,"She came and she touched me
With hands made of heaven
Reflections sent spinnin'
Through a face laced in mist
Now I stand where she left me
Buried deep 'neath her shadow
And the mirror plead sadly
Does it all come to this
And I wonder: Will she call my name?

The wind careens madly
Through wide windows paneless
Fragrancies mingle
In a room full of shade
The peons pick partners
And waltz cross the ceilings
But the violins whisper
That I've been betrayed
Tryin not to look ashamed

The drunkards drink deeply
From cups full of nothingness
Ghost lovers laugh
At the games that they play
The moments do somersaults
Into eternity
Cling to their coattails
And beg them to stay
Saying I got nothing to hide

Illusions projected
On walls made of Tiffany
Mad men you adds to
A sad satin song
A harlequin mandolins
Harmonize helplessly
Hoping that endlessly
Won't last for long
Praying that their God ain't dying

Then I turn and I see her
In a dress made of moonlight
Teardrops like diamonds
Run slow down her face
Her arms surround me
Like chains made of velvet
And the demons fall faithfully
Into their place
And the rivers run with jewels

Now the morning lies open
The night went quite quickly
Memory harmlessly
Fractures and fades
All the poets do push-ups
On carpets of rubber foam
Loudly they laugh
At some joke that's been made
And the wise men speak like fools",She Came and She Touched Me,1969
Townes Van Zandt,"Mr ten dollar man

Townes Van Zandt,"When she had twenty years she turned to her mother
Saying Mother, I know that you'll grieve
But I've given my soul to St John the gambler
Tomorrow comes time leave
For the hills cannot hold back my sorrow forever
And dead men lay deep 'round the door
Of the only salvation that's mine for the asking
So mother, think on me no more

Winter held high round the mountains breast
And the cold of a thousand snows
Lay heaped upon the forests leaf
But she dressed in calico
For a gambler likes his women fancy
Fancy she would be
And the fire of her longing would keep way the cold
And her dress was a sight to see

But the road was long beneath the feet
She followed her frozen breath
In search of a certain St John the gambler
Stumbling to her death
She heard his laughter right down from the mountains
And danced with her mothers tears
To a funeral drawn a calico
'neath the cross of twenty years

like laughter she falls
from a castle of sand
like a memory she crawls

that the lady has died
what it all goes to show
it ain't my job to say
for who am I to know
why she's actin' this way

Once again turn away
if you're sure that it's done

tell your bandits to run
take your eyelids of stone
they won't do you no harm
take your cross made of bones
take your your fly-paper arms
and when everything's placed
in your coffin and go
through a scarf 'round your face
'Cause the subway gets cold
pack up your sunflower smile
and your bandana blues
take your worthless denials
they're all you've got left to lose
take your Tinkerbell lies
and your weary desires
take the tears in your eyes
take your cup full of fire
give your lover a call
if your legs start to fail
and he'll come break your fall
with a bed full of nails

No need to glance back again

Till his long, green eyes did glow
And Mud was left with the sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go

Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend

Now, the Diamond Queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
And prayed to the angels every one

Now, the Diamond Queen, she prayed and prayed
And the Diamond Angel filled Muds hole
The wicked King of Clubs himself
Fell in face down in front of Gold

Now, three kings come to Clubs command
But the angels from the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the muddy side

Turned out to be a wandering boy

Townes Van Zandt,"Of those that sailed the silver ships
From Andilar I am the last
The deeds that rang our youthful dreams
It seems shall go undone
North for the shores of Valinor
Our bows and crimson sails were made
Our captains were strong, our lances long
And our liege the holy king

The hills did turn from green to blue
And vanish as on the decks we watched
But every thought in that noble company
Was forward bound
To the lifeless plains of Valinor
Where reigns the dark and frozen one
And with tongues afire and glorious eyes
We pledged our mission be

The clime from mild to bitter ran
The wind from fair to fierce did blow
Oath and prayer did turn to thoughts
Of homes left far behind
Longed every man for some glimpse of land
And the host that did await us there
But each new day brought only a sea
And sky of ice and gray

Thanks give no word can drag you through
Those endless weeks our ships did roll
Thanks give you cannot see those sails
And faces bleach and draw
Ice we drank and leather did chew
For the oceans are unwholesome there
The dead that slid into the seas
Did freeze before our eyes

Then a wind did fling the ships apart
Each one to go her separate way
The sky did howl, the hull did groan
For how long I do not know
And what men were left when the winds had ceased
Grew dull and low of countenance
For soldiers denied their battle plain
On comrades soon must turn

So one by one we died alone
Some by hunger, some by steel
Bodies froze where they did fall
Their souls unsanctified
Until only another and I were left
Then just before his flame did fail
We shone ourselves brothers-in-arms
To serve the holy king

Perhaps this shall reach Andilar
Although I know not how it can

Upon the silver prow

I joined a fraternity organisation
Tucked in my shirt
Signed on the line
Right away they said about to improve my mind

The books I read
The food I ate
The booze I drank
The girls I took out
My breath

Said ""Kid, we don't much like the way you walk
And you gonna have to change the way you talk""
They said ""your dress is kind of sludge
And your attitude is mighty grudge""
Said ""you got to learn to bubble""
""You got to bubble with enthusiasm"" I started bubble
""Most important thing you can't forget
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet""

That that's gonna make me anymore a man
But I learned it
I can whip through that Son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds

Concerning the payment of monthly dues

I never was sure it was well spent
But I paid it
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life

I went back to the house in about an hour
When the boy's were drinking whiskey sours

I could see I was gonna have to do my very best
To get myself out of that fraternity mess
I stood right there outside the door

And he said ""Thunderbird's not an old Indian trinket,
It's a wine, man, you take it home and drink it.""
I said ""It sure don't sound like wine to me""

For just you and me, girl,
The sun shine and turmoil
Will spill from a basket of blue",Little Sundance #2,1987
Townes Van Zandt,"When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
And the moon along
The Gunnison don't rise
Shall I cast my dreams
Upon your love, babe
And lie beneath
The laughter of your eyes
It's snowin' on Raton
Come morning I'll be through
Them hills and gone
Mother thinks the road
Is long and lonely
Little brother thinks
The road is straight and fine
Little darling thinks
The road is soft and lovely
I'm thankful that old road
Is a friend of mine
Bid the years good-bye
You cannot still them
You cannot turn
The circles of the sun
You cannot count the miles
Until you feel them
And you cannot hold
A lover that has gone
Tomorrow the mountains
Will be sleeping
Silent 'neath a blanket
Green and blue
All that I shall hear
The silence they are keeping
I'll bring all their promises to you",Snowin' on Raton,1987

Cocaine, cocaine,

'Round my heart and runnin' 'round my brain,

Cocaine, aw, you ol' cocaine.


I woke up this mornin', Lord, I had a hunger pain.

And all I want for breakfast is my good cocaine,

Cocaine, aw you ol' cocaine.


Jump out of bed, Mama, run downtown;

Take along the money and look all around.

Find the man, the man that sells cocaine.



Come here, Mama, come here quick;

That ol' coke's got me and I'm feelin' sick.

Cocaine, aw you ol' cocaine.



Get out of here, Mama, I thought you understood;

You got no connections then you're no damn good.

Cocaine.



Well, coke's for horses, Lord, it ain't for men.

They say it kills you, but they don't say when.



c'mon, Mama, let's rent us a boat.

We'll sail down that Gibraltar moat;

Shed a tear every time we pass Tangiers.

Cocaine, aw, you ol' cocaine.

Talkin' to some rich folks that you know

Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

that turnin' round
is to become confusion
and the gold's no good for spending
and the poison's hungry waiting


What can you leave behind
when you're flyin' lightning fast
and all alone?
Only a trace, my friend,
spirit of motion born
and direction grown.
A trace that will not fade

your journey will be
and if her shadow doesn't seem much company

Townes Van Zandt High, Low and In Between Lyrics


","High, Low + In Between",1994
Townes Van Zandt,"Well, Billy went down to the battleground
To find a little trinket he could call his own
Didn't see nothin' lying around
He decided he'd dig awhile
Well he dug her up and he dug her down
'Fore too long he found some bones
Poor little Billy couldn't make a sound
When the bones sat up and smiled

Oh Billy you seem like a fine young man
No reason to be a tremblin' soul
Come over here and shake my hand
Make my proud acquaintance
Well Billy he was stunned he could hardly stand
Whether he could move he didn't know
But he knew he had to formulate some kinda plan
Or try the boneman's patience

The first thing he wanted to do was breathe
So he gulped in some of that battleground air
Next thing he wanted to do was leave
But Billy wasn't raised up rude
Well the boneman grunted and he gave a heave
All of a sudden he was loomin' there
Shakin' off dirt and actin' pleased
Things didn't look too good

Well Billy decided what the hell
You don't meet a boneman every day
A little bit skinny but you never can tell
He might be a pretty good guy
Well they started off with the old soft sell
'Fore too long they were jawin' away
By the time the darkness fell
They were seein' socket to eye

They decided right then on a life of crime
With the boneman's looks and Billy's brains
They could scare old Scrooge out of his last dime
Might as well have a go
Billy he would picked the place and time
From the corner store to the railroad train
Boney'd flash him a smile sublime
And Billy he'd grab the dough

They decided they might as well start right then
Time's awastin' so they say
They headed for the park
Where the lights are dim
And only the foolish tread
He was whistlin' a tune
When they spotted him strollin' along
So plump and gay
Boney gave him a great big grin
And Billy snagged his bread

Next come a lady of the night
Boney saddled up and said hello
Gave the poor thing such a terrible fright
She fainted dead away
Billy lifted her purse and her earrings bright
Diamond rings and watch you know
Couldn't figure out try as they might
Why they'd ever worked a single day

Billy's plans ended up in ruin you know
They were workin' a quaint little neighborhood
Spied an old lady about eighty or so
Almost looked too easy
Boney put on a pretty good show
The little ol' lady didn't see too good
My kind Sir your all bones you know
You need something hot and greasy

Grabbed ol' Boney drug him inside
Billy peeked in through the window sill
She fed him boiled and baked and fried
Ol' Boney he's chewin like crazy
He gobbled up everything he tried
Pounds added on like you know they will
Billy laid down in the dirt and cried
Watchin Boney Gettin fat and lazy

Well Billy's back workin his job by day
Sleep'n nights it ain't so bad
Never liked stealin anyway
Kinda gives a guy the willies
Boney and Ma got a new cafe
Best baked beans you ever had
Ma's expecting any day
And they say they're gonna name him Billy","Billy, Boney and Ma",1995
Townes Van Zandt,"I gotta guitar all my own
I gotta quarter for the telephone
I ain't headed down this highway all alone
One two three and maybe four
Honey, they're knockin' on my door
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Got no daddy but I got a ma
Think she lives in Arkansas
Maybe I'll go see her some old day
It ain't like she'd really care
It ain't like she'd pay no fare
But I might just blow on through there anyway

Headed down to Alabam
Cause some trouble if I can

It's a place I never been

I'm gonna ride I ain't lookin' back
Tried to stop but I can't unpack
Gotta get used to the clickety-clack
The big ol' wheels and the smokin' stack
Ah babe I gotta go
Babe I gotta go

Loved you honey heart and soul
I swear you're the sweetest thing I know
I loved you true and I told you so
I told you too come time to go
I'll be gone with any ol' wind that blows
Ah babe I just can't stay
And it's bound to be that way

There's lots of things I'd like to see
From the mountains to the shining sea
Up in the sky where the wind blows free
To the cities down below
Babe I just don't know
I got trouble, trouble in my soul
I got trouble in my soul

I'm gonna lay my trouble on a railroad track

Townes Van Zandt,"Baby hit the back door breathin' real heavy
Said the boys in the alley wouldn't leave her alone
Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry
She finally got ready but the boys were gone
Mama don't you worry, night's aproachin'
There's a hole in heaven where some sin slips through
Close your eyes and dream real steady
Maybe just a little will spill on you

The dark don't lie
And dreams come true
Could be a few will see you through

Old lady Rose, lookin' down her nose
At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over
Rosy's just waitin' for the ax to fall

The sky's still shiny and the earth's still brown
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases
Gonna dance in their faces
When the guitar sounds

It won't be long
I won't be gone
I've been leaning toward the shadows all along

Those in the know say how it goes
You plan on reapin' you better sow
You plan on sleepin' you better keep movin'
Sleepin' ain't allowed around here you know
Tell me please when the rollin's over
Me and my baby gonna have some fun
Bury our backs in a bed of clover
Smile in style while the sun goes down

Snake eyes cry
And boxcars sigh
Seven's stuck in the middle just wonderin' why

And dreams come true

Maybe get my ashes hauled
I can drive me a car

She runs so fast
You can't catch her from behind
Ah, she runs so fast
You can't catch her from behind

Townes Van Zandt,"The old woman finally caught me
Sneakin' 'round her cave
Her hair looked just like barbwire, boys
And her smile just like the grave
She asked me could I stay awhile
I said I'd better go
She slid her arm around my neck
And sweetly whispered no

It's cold and dark and lonely here
As soon enough you'll see
I'm oh so glad you stumbled in
I've been cravin' company
I cannot stay too long you know
I left some friends at home
Don't you fret about your friends
Down here we're all alone

What about my mother
I can't just leave her there to mourn
You don't have to think about her
Just forget you were ever born
I'll disappoint my father
You know he worked so hard for me
If you have to pay your father back
Just send him some misery

I'll miss, I said, a girl I know
I can't just leave there to pine
She's still got plenty of men to go
I'm sure she'll do just fine
What about my little boy
She said, he's just like you
Let a few short years roll by
He'll end up down here too

Then her pale green eyes began to glow
She placed her hand on mine
She smiled and said don't worry
You'll get used to me in time
As her cold tongue flickered toward
I spun myself around
Made a dive for the passageway
But the walls come crashing down

Now her eyes were the only light
My fevered brain could see
But I tore myself away from them
And fell down to my knees
I've come too far, I can't get back
I beseeched the Gods of men
Fame and fortune just laughed at me
Then silence once again

A whisper deep within
Embrace the God of Love
I lifted my face and through the tears
I saw light fall from above

I hurled myself into the wall
I ripped and clawed my way
Through the stinkin', clingin' loam
Back to the light of day
I crawled out into the wind again
The sky upon my face
I heard the earth sigh patiently
As it slid back into place

Now I'm back among the ones I love
I'm loved by them in turn
And it's only on the darkest night
That green eyed memory burns
So walk my friends, in the light of day
Don't go sneakin' 'round no holes
There just might be something down there
Wants to gobble up your soul",The Hole,1995
Townes Van Zandt,"There is no deeper blue
In the ocean that lies
As deep as the blue
Of your laughing eyes
No sweeter sound
Than your gentle sigh
No heart was ever so pure

Dream pretty dreams
Touch beautiful things
Let all the skies surround you
Swim with the swans
And believe that upon
Some glorious dawn
Love will find you

Come some day
I'm bound away
Wind and wings on the water
Whatever may
You must stay
And remain my beautiful daughter

There is no deeper blue

Time's gonna roll soft as rain
Sigh after sigh is gonna pass by and by
Ah love's gonna fly on the wind
When I gaze into your brown eyes again

All the things I've seen
And the places that I've been

Townes Van Zandt,"I stood in line and left my name
Took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
Said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
Shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
Now I can't stay there no more

Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
To move some old cars around
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
Van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
That job's about a half week old besides
It'd be gone now anyway

Unemployment said I got no more checks
And they showed me to the hall
My brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
A little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
We're headed down into fall

I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
Hustled up a little dough
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
A couple of months ago
They got my harp and they got my dollar
Them low life so and so's
Harps cost money and I ain't got it
It's my own fault I suppose

The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
Two freights everyday
If it was just me I'd be headed south
But Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
Says we gotta wait and see
In my heart I know it's a little boy
Hope he don't end up like me

Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
Hope she don't break down and cry

Marie she didn't wake up this morning
She didn't even try
She just rolled over and went to heaven
My little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly

So's to meet me by and by

Marie will know I'm headed south
So to meet me by and by",Marie,1995
Townes Van Zandt,"On the banks of the Niles I courted my love
I walked with her soft as a mournin' dove
I loved her true I swear I still do
And now she's gone without me

I walk by the banks and give the Lord thanks
That I had the chance to court her
I don't know why he flew her away
I don't know why I'm left here

The Niles runs cold and clear
As cold and clear as my tears
I'll never forget, I'll never regret
Those days on the beautiful Niles

Her name was Diane her beautiful hands
Were soft as the pearls in the water
I looked in her eyes they were blue as the skies
And now I've gone and left her

I'll follow her down the way to the river
Follow her now, now and forever
She's my one and only smile
On the beautiful banks of the Niles

Someday soon 'neath the light of the moon
When the sun and the rain shine together
I'll meet her down where the waters flow
And continue to flow forever

Down on the banks of the beautiful Niles
I wonder what I can be thinking
Down on the banks of that beautiful river
I'll wander, look for her forever
I'll wander, look for her forever",Niles River Blues,1995

I tasted your earth
Sung out my heart
For what it was worth
Never again shall I ramble

There's nowhere left
In this world where to go
My arms, my legs they're a-tremblin'
Thoughts both clouded and blue as the sky
Not even worth the rememberin'

Now as I stumble
And reel to my bed
All that I've done
All that I've said
Means nothin' to me

All of this world be forgotten

No words of comfort
No words of advice
Nothin' to offer a stranger
Gone the love, gone the spite

The ground's gettin' close

Townes Van Zandt,"Greensboro woman don't you smile on me
I do not feel like being comforted
and anyway I'll be home soon
for once is someone waitin' there
and if you don't mind
I just think on her instead

Your face, she's a picture, babe
pictures ain't what I crave
I don't feel this way most generally
I just pit a thousand miles 'tween me
and where my thoughts do lie
and I thank you kindly baby to kindly let me be

Your car, she's smooth and fast
babe, your bourbon's fine
but I ain't feelin free and clear today

I couldn't do you right babe spinnin' round this way

Townes Van Zandt,"Down at the bottom of that dirty ol' river
Down where the reeds and the catfish play
There lies a dream as soft as the water
There lies a bluebird that's flown away

Well, to meet is like springtime
And to love's like the summer
Her brown eyes shone for nobody but me
Then autumn forever, the fool come a fallin'
And the rain turned to freezin' inside of me

I'll kindle my fires with the words
I can't send you
And the roads I can't follow
And the songs I can't sing

Well, all you young ladies
Who dream of tomorrow
While you're a listenin'
These words will I say
Cling to today with its joy
And its sorrow
You'll need all your memories
When youth melts away.

Well, the angel of springtime
He rides down the southwind
The angel of summer
He does just the same
The angel of autumn
She's blue and she's golden
And the angel of winter
Won't remember your name

Down at the bottom of that dirty ol' river
Down where the reeds and the catfish play
There lies a dream as soft as the water
There lies a bluebird that's flown away

There lies a bluebird
That's flown away",Catfish Song (Into),1998
Townes Van Zandt,"When I was a lad and Old Shep was a pup
O'er hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would've drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pulled me out

So the years fed along and at last he grew old
His eyesight was fast growin' dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can't do no more for him, Jim""

With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
And I wished that they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knee
I stroked the best pal that a man ever found
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie, he knew he was going to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me just as much as to say
We're parting but you understand

Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home

",Old Shep,1998
Townes Van Zandt,"I come from a long line
High and low and in between
Same as you
Hills of golden
Hails of poison
Time's thrown me through
And I believe I've come to learn
That turnin' round
Is to become confusion
And the gold's no good for spending
And the poison's hungry waiting

What can you leave behind
When you're flyin' lightning fast
And all alone?
Only a trace, my friend,
Spirit of motion born
And direction grown.
A trace that will not fade
In frozen skies
Your journey will be
And if her shadow doesn't seem much company
Who said it would be?

There is the highway
And the homemade lovin' kind
The highway's mine
And us ramblers are getting the travelling down
You fathers build with stones
That stand and shine
Heaven's where you find it
And you can't
Take too much with you
But daddy, don't you listen
It's just this highway talkin'

All things at our life
Are brothers in the soil
And in the sky
And I believe it
With my blood
If not my eyes
I don't know why we can't
Be brothers here
I know we should be
Answers don't seem easy
And I'm wonderin'
If they could be","High, Low and In Between",1998
Townes Van Zandt,"Oh Loretta she's a barroom girl
Wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines
Tell me lies I love to believe
Her age is always 22
Her laughing eyes a hazel hue
Spends my money like water falls
Loves me like I want her to

Oh, Loretta, won't you say to me
Darling, put your guitar on
Have a little shot of booze
Play a blue a and wailing song
My guitar rings a melody
My guitar sings, Loretta's fine
Long and lazy, blonde and free
And I can have her any time

Sweetest at the break of day
Prettiest in the setting sun
She don't cry when I can't stay
'Least not 'til she's all alone
Loretta, I won't be gone long
Keep your dancing slippers on
Keep me on your mind a while
I'll be back, babe, to make you smile",Loretta,1998
Townes Van Zandt,"The wicked king of clubs awoke
It was to his queen turned
His lips were laughing as they spoke
His eyes like bullets burned
The sun's upon a gambling day
His queen smiled low and blissfully
Let's make some wretched fool to play
Plain it was she did agree

He send his deuce down into diamond
His four to hart, and his trey to spade
Three kings with their legions come
Preparations soon where made
They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky

He give his sevens first instructions
Spirit me a game of stud
Stakes unscarred by limitation
'Tween a man named Gold and man named Mud
Club filled Gold with greedy vapors
'Til his long, green eyes did glow
Mud was left with the sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go

Flushes fell on Gold like water
Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend
The diamond queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
Prayed to the angels every one

The diamond queen, she prayed and prayed
And the diamond angel filled Muds hole
The wicked king of clubs himself
Fell in face down in front of Gold
Now three kings come to Clubs command
But the angels from the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the muddy side

The club queen heard her husband's call
But Lord that queen of diamond's joy
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
Turned out to be a wandering boy
Now Mud he checked and Gold bet all
And Mud he raised and Gold did call
And the smile just melted off his face
When Mud turned over that diamond ace

Now here's what this story's told
If you feel like Mud you'll end up Gold
If you feel like lost, you'll end up found
So amigo, lay them raises down",Mr. Gold and Mr. Mud,1998
Townes Van Zandt,"Now this man down at the used car lot
Tried to sell me four wheels and a trunk.
I said, ""Man, there is no engine!"",
He said, ""The engine's just a bunch of junk.
You don't need no engine to go downhill
And I could plainly see, that that's the direction
You're headed in"", and he handed me the keyes.

(I said) No deal; you can't sell this stuff to me
No deal, I'm going back to Tennessee

Well, I went to a doctor of the highest order,
He said I couldn't have a drink for a year.
One glass of wine on my birthday
If my birthday wasn't too very near.
Lord, he must have put me in a state of shock
'cause I made it for about two weeks;
Then he sent me a bill
That knocked me flat off the wagon
And back down on my feet.

When true love knocked upon my door
She'd just barely turned fifteen
And I was a little bit nervous
If you know just what I mean.
But I've heard somewhere
That true love conquers all
And I figured that was that
Then I started having dreams 'bout
Being chased out of town
Wearing nothing but my cowboy hat.

Well, I come through this life a stumbler, my friends
I expect to die that way
It could be twenty years from now
It could be most any day.
But if there is no whiskey and women, Lord,
Behind them heavenly doors
I'm gonna take my chances down below,
And of that you can be sure.",No Deal,1998
Townes Van Zandt,"If I had no place to fall
And I needed to
Could I count on you
To lay me down?

I'd never tell you no lies
I don't believe it's wise
You got pretty eyes
Won't you spin me 'round

I ain't much of a lover it's true
I'm here then I'm gone
And I'm forever blue
But I'm sure wanting you

Skies full of silver and gold
Try to hide the sun
But it can't be done
Least not for long

And if we help each other grow
While the light of day
Smiles down our way
Then we can't go wrong

Time, she's a fast old train
She's here then she's gone
And she won't come again
Won't you take my hand

And I needed to
Could I count on you
To lay me down?",No Place to Fall,1998
Townes Van Zandt,"You can't hold me
I'm too slippery
I do no sleepin'
I get lonely
You can touch me
If you want to
I got poison
I just might bite you

On the sunlight
Shine like diamonds
On a dark night
Ain't no mercy
In my smilin'
Only fangs and
Sweet beguiling

Future, he don't
Try to find me
Skin I been through
Dies behind me
Solid hollow
Wrapped in hatred
Not a drop of
Venom wasted

Flat deny me

You start sinkin'.",Snake Song,1998
Townes Van Zandt,"I'm standin' with my bowed head down now
That ain't right that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
I keep on tryin but it's been so long

If I hurt you I did not mean to
I beg you pardon I did not want to
When I leave you don't you think about me
I won't be back babe I'll be long gone

When the time comes and I'm not ready
Seems it's over before I'm started
The time comes and I don't feel it

And my way sometimes it hurts so
And your way just don't go home",Standin',1998
Townes Van Zandt,"Won't say I love you, babe
Won't say I need you, babe
But I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
And I'll waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long
You're soft as glass
And I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the earth to lie upon

Days, up and down they come
Like rain on a congadrum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
And nothin' is too much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep is the getting there

To live is to fly
Low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

Goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low
And the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think too much
On things you leave behind
I will be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a'bringin' back the melodies
And rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
Them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
The choice is yours to make
Time is yours to take
Some sail upon/dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone

To live is to fly

So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

And the tears out of your eyes",To Live Is to Fly,1998

I want to clap my hands together
I got two legs
I want to dance to heavens door
I got one heart
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus
And I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore

Well now, this old world sometimes it does get lonesome
And it's many a grown man has hung his head and cried
Down in your soul there's one that won't desert you
Ain't it fine to have the Saviour by your side

Now the Lord resides inside a house of golden
And faith is the door and love is the key
And warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows
And that light, my friend, it shines on you and me

When the wind blows on that faithful morning
And I close my eyes, Lord, and fly my body home
I don't want my friends to cry no tears about me
I'll be batheing in the glory of the throne

Take all your money and kidnap your kids
Take all your money and buy me some lids

And I'll call up your husband, tell him you're dead
Take out your tonsils and make you give head
Put all o' the air out of all your tyres
Take out your molars with needle-nose pliers

Townes Van Zandt,"Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be

If I had a nickel I'd find a game
If I won a dollar I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied

Legs to walk and thoughts to fly
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

So tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none

I'm chained upon the face of time
Feelin' full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave this dark behind

Wrap you up in hospital green
Shoot you full of Thorazine

Could be TB or maybe a tumor
Eavesdropping on the doctors, listening to the rumors
Can't see your friends, hear the hum of the wheels
Hey, my man, you know how it feels
Like the sanitarium blues

Then upon some sunlit day
They figure there's no need for you to stay
They're pretty sure you can't be cured
So they send you on your merry way

You're just tryin' to stay above the ground
You start to thinkin', what's the use?
