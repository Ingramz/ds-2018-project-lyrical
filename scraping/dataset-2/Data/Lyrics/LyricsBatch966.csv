Ryan Adams,"Movin' like the fog on the Cumberland River
I was leaving on the Delta Queen
I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Twenty-seven years of nothin' but failures and promises that I couldn't keep

Oh lord I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of the darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home
Let it ride
Let it roll
Let it go

Loaded like a sailor
Tumbling off a ferry boat
I was at the bar till three
Oh Lord, and I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina where they're gonna bury me

And I ain't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Let it ride let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of this darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home
Let it ride
Let it roll
Let it go

I want to see you tonight
Dancing in the endless moonlight
In the parking lot in the headlights of cars
Someplace on the moon
Where they moved the drive-in theater
Where I left the car that I can't find but I still got the keys to

Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of this darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home
Let it ride
Let it roll
Let it go",Let It Ride,2005
Ryan Adams,"You plant a rose 
And if the rose comes up 
You're thankful to God 
And when it doesn't you cuss him 
You raise a child 
And when the child grows up 
You got to learn to let go 
If you can't learn to love him 

But, oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
'Cause if I don't believe in love 
Then I don't believe in you 
And I do 

Now I'm not saying only bad news comes 
For the people who want it 
But you gotta play that music for who's listening 
You got to have someone you wanna sing it to 

Oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Blue sky cracking and it makes me believe 
Oh, hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
'Cause if I don't believe in love 
Then I don't believe in you 
And I do 

Close my eyes, see the glorious sunset 
Through the windows of a store and I want it 
Anyway, if I ever felt haunted 
You were there for me 

These angry people who are waiting to judge you 
Have their own judgment that they'll have live up to 
Open your mouth 
And if nothing come through 
Remember 
You're the one that sings 
And it's a gift 
And life's a beautiful thing 
Oh, don't waste it doll 

You build a house and if the house comes up 
You gotta work on that house 
If you want to make it your home 
'Cause everything inside that's not something you own 
Is what you're taking with you 
On the day that you go 

And oh, what a beautiful world when we sing 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Oh, hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
'Cause if I don't believe in love 
Then I don't believe in you 
And I do",Life Is Beautiful,2005
Ryan Adams,"I want to go to Magnolia Mountain
And lay my weary head down
Down on the rocks
Of the mountain my savior made
Steady my soul and ease my worry
Hold me when I rattle like a hummingbird hummin'
Tie me to the rocks of the mountain my savior made

Lie to me
Sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
And if the morning come, will you lie to me?
Will you take me to your bed?
Will you lay me down?
Til' I'm heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my savior made
Please

I want to be the bluebird singin'
Singin' to the roses in her yard
The roses in her yard her father grew for her
It's been raining like Tennessee honey
So long I got too heavy to fly
Ain't no bluebird ever gets too heavy to sing

Lie to me
Sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
And if the morning don't come, will you lie to me?
Will you take me to your bed?
Will you lay me down?
'Til I'm heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my savior made
Please
Please

We burn the cotton fields down in the valley
And ended up with nothing but scars
The scars became the lessons that we gave to our children after the war
There ain't nothing but the truth up on Magnolia Mountain
Where nobody ever dies
Steady your soul and ease your worry
They got a room for you

Lie to me like I lie to you
Calm me down until the morning comes
And if the morning don't come
Lie to me
Will you take me to your bed?
Will you lay me down?
All heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my savior made
For us
Please
For us
For me
For us
For me",Magnolia Mountain,2005
Ryan Adams,"There's something about you
That reminds me of all those times
When I wasn't sorry, when I wasn't blue
The cherry moon it shone down on us
Under the stars shining down every one for you
If I could count them all
I would circle the moon
And count 'em back to nothing
Till I got to you

Something in you dies, when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream
That's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?

I used to be the house that you lived in
Down on Meadowlake Street
When you moved they cut down the maple tree
I carved your name into
The tree became a boat, I christened it your name
And when the water turned to salt
From your tears it hit the bottom of the ocean
Where I go when I hear your name
And I sink like a stone

Something in you dies, when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream
That's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?
Why do I dream of you
I feel like a dream that's not having
Like a nervous joke ain't nobody laughing
Like somebody with nothing 'cause they don't know
What they're wanting
Tiny like the sand in the cracks of drift wood
Washed up on the shore of an ocean of you
Boats out on the horizon
Made of the maple tree where we used to lie down
On Meadowlake Street counting the stars you and I
You and I
Something in you dies when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream that's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you
Why do I dream of you
Why",Meadowlake Street,2005
Ryan Adams,"Mockingbirds sing
Sing me what the Lord was singing
On the day He made the water
The color of the blues
Sing me that song
Sing me till the heavens rising
On the day He made the water
The color of my baby's eyes

Love her in the way you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
It must not be enough
'Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
And if you give up

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
The rivers they run
They run until they get too tired
Until they run behind the houses
And they become the creek
When I was a child
I ran until the creek became the river
When it turned into the ocean
I wondered why he made it so deep

Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
Must not be enough
'Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
Don't give up
'Cause in a way she's crying
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
If you give up

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love

Love her in the ways that you want to be loved
Love her in the ways that you want to be loved
Love her in the ways that you want to be loved

Sometimes it ain't enough
Sometimes it ain't enough
But don't give up on love

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love",Mockingbird,2005
Ryan Adams,"When I pick up my guitar
This is the song that always comes
Don't know what I'm singing 'bout and
Don't know what for
I think about you
And I think about Rosebud

Wish there was a song to sing
To bring you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take care of myself
And my friends

You sing to a field of trees
And roses singing those melodies
Simple and easy where everything moves
Underneath you
And Rosebud too

I wish there was a song to sing
To get you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take it easy
But I took a photograph
And she's just a wooden machine
But you and Rosebud, you're still singing to me",Rosebud,2005
Ryan Adams,"Let me go I'm only letting you down
I got nothing to say to you now
Lose the feelings that are weighing me down
When I'm sane

It's turning morning all the birds sing
I'm not complicating anything
I'll have another and then I'll go to bed
And dream of you

Cause it's almost over
Yeah it's almost gone

I can feel the sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you now

You and I used to shine like a jewel
But time's been nothing to us but cruel
So play it out and never play the fool
Cause you'll lose everytime

We were nothing,we were only the past
Hard times like that don't last
I've been forgiven,I've been surpassed
By my heart
Have you?

Cause it's almost over
Yeah it's almost gone

I can feel the sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love

Love for you that I can't use
Lonely nights multiplied by the blues
I can't resolve

You never knew me but you did you're best
I'm just lonely inside I guess
You gave me everything you really tried
Thanks

If we are nothing and we're only the past
Well I'm just living in a dream I guess
A long black dream that takes me down the river to you

Where it's almost over
And it's almost gone

And I can feel the sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down

Sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you now",Sweet Illusions,2005
Ryan Adams,"There's something in the way she eases my mind
And lays me across the bed till I close my eyes
Stirs me in the morning till I can ever be satisfied
I leave Carolina every night in my dreams
Like the girls that try to love me that I only leave
Rock me like a baby doll and hold me to your chest
But I'm always moving too fast

If I could find my way back home, where would I go?
When everything about me, I used to be,
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
Lost out in the woods were you're looking for me

When, when will you come back home
No one leave the lights on in a house
Where nobody lives anymore
Loaded like the boxes up in the bedroom
Coming off the hinges like the door
The shadows dancing up in the window
They're not who we are but who we were
And I'm not gonna break, but if I do
I'm gonna shatter like the glass I turned your heart into
I'm broken like the windows in the house where I used to live
And If I could find my way back home, where would I go?

When everything about me, I used to be,
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
I'm lost out in the woods looking for you
When, when will you come back home
No one leave the lights on in a house
Where nobody lives anymore
Everything about me you liked is already gone
Everything about me you loved is gone",When Will You Come Back Home,2005
Ryan Adams,"You're an impossible dream
So when I go to bed
That's all I'm doing I'm just sleeping
Cocktails in the ESP
Think about you to think about me

I wonder, I want to see you tonight
I want to see you, I want to see you,
I want to see you smiling back at me in the starlight
Shining on the streets downtown
I was looking for you
Looking for me, again
God I want to taste your mouth

Back you are up against the wall behind a subway station
I want to see you smile
I want to see, I want to see, I want to see you tonight
Meet me on the corner, 44th and Broadway

Did it rain, oh, God
You could be happy in love
You can be happy in love with me
That's is you want to for just a little while
No promises no guarantees tonight
Meet me in the hall
Meet me in the hall

I'm terrorizing so
You bet
'Cause I want to see you tonight
I want to see, I want to see, I want to see you tonight
Meet me on the corner, 44th and Broadway

Did it rain, God
You could be happy in love
You could be happy in love with me
Forever, forever, forever
Tonight, tonight",Tonight,2005
Ryan Adams,"I got a house full of walls 
And utility bills, every Monday the company calls 
I got a nice bed to sleep on 
And a chest of drawers, where I keep those jewels of yours 

Cause you're always mine to keep when you're gone 
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone 
It went underground with you, oh John 

Ten years passed 
And I ended up with a house full of cats 
But most of them went missing 
On that window you never fixed, the door you never latched 

When you were on your way out like the last time

Cause you are always mine to keep when you're gone 
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone 
It went underground with you, oh John, oh John

I knew what you were doing 
That summer when Candy came around 
But I had too much hurt to bother you 
When we lost our first child I thought a little payment was overdue 
And I wanted you so bad

Cause you are always mine to keep when you're gone 
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone 
It went underground with you, oh John, oh John, oh John, o John 

I miss you

Ryan Adams,"I don't know the sound of my father's voice 
I don't even know how he says my name 
But it plays out like a song on a jukebox in a bar 
In the back of my head 
Till its worrying machine 
And in the cotton fields by the house where I was born 
The leaves burn like effigies of my kin 
And the trains run like snakes 
Through the Pentecostal pines 
Filled up with cotton and dime store gin 
Oh Jacksonville, how you burden my soul 
How you hold all my dreams captive 
Jacksonville, how you play with my mind 
How my heart goes bad 
Suffocating on the pines in Jacksonville 
The end, the end, the end 

All the cars are lined up on a Saturday night 
With a sky full of nothing but moon 
And I lose my reflection in a bottle of wine 
Till the morning comes down 
And I ain't nothing but blue (you) 
At the diner in the morning for a plate of eggs 
The waitress tries to give me change, I say 
""Nah its cool. you just keep it"" 
I read up my news 
I start thinking about her 
And I wonder if anybody here besides me 
Has got any decent secrets 
Oh Jacksonville, how you burden my soul 
How you hold all my dreams captive 
Jackson-Hell, how you play with my mind 
How my heart goes bad suffocating on the pines 
In Jacksonville 
The end, the end, the end",The End,2005
Ryan Adams,"You ain't but a fire on my sad estate 
Burning my house to the ground 
High and mellow, oh how she rides me 
Out in the meadow where the taxis don't ride 
A million times quicker than the pain 
Oh, games 
A million times better than the pain 

You ain't but a telegram nobody's sendin' 
Nobody sends me but you

A million times quicker than the pain

A million times better than the pain

Ryan Adams,"See the rain on the street 
The way the cars shine 
And the scotch that she drinks 
With her lips so fine 
And her shoulders go weak 
As she closes her eyes 
Oh, my God, when she was mine 

See how she moves through the door 
How she loses her keys 
How she loses her cool 
Watching blackbirds scatter through the trees 
How she flips from the back to the front 
Reading magazines 
Oh, my God, I miss those things 
And it's a hard way to fall 
And this ain't the easy way down 
And it's a hard thing to love anyone, anyhow 

So if it's gotta be you 
Treat her nice 
Hold her hand 
And tell her twice 
That she doesn't have to worry 
And it will be alright 
It's alright this time 
It's alright this time 

See her smiling at him? 
That used to be me 
I could find her in a thunderstorm 
Just by the way that the rain would fall 
And we used to be something 
But somethin' happened to me

And it's a hard way to fall

I ain't got no money don't want no more 
Pay my respects to the company boys now just move along 
I worked hard for every little bit I got 
And got lucky once on some advice 
Met a dark haired girl that the Mississippi moon 
Musta left by mistake one night 
In a hurry, Lord 

And that ain't the hardest part 
The hardest part is loving 
Somebody that cares for you so much 

Promises don't pay cash at the bank 
If they did I'm bidding your word 
They couldn't pay me for the time that it took to write a check 
To buy a babydoll for my girl 
And I worked hard for every little bit I got 
The things I got are gonna stay 
And it's been flooding so hard on them company mines 
That you know it's gonna flood someday 
And you're gonna miss someone 

And that ain't the hardest part 
The hardest part is loving somebody that cares for you 
And that ain't the hardest part 
The hardest part is working and I've worked enough 

I could stretch that penny like a silver line 
Rolling through the pages of my life 
Underneath your name where it's underlined 
I've been turned around 
I've been mystified by a true love

One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go 

One more kiss 'fore I go 
One more night and day 
Breath all heavy and slow 
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go 

I'll miss those nights at the bar 
With every girl all loaded like freights 
And the pain in the morning comes as easy as it goes 
Can't find the truth in a house of lies 
And you can't see tomorrow with yesterday's eyes

Ryan Adams,"Pa drove to town yesterday to pick out her grave 
He found the lot where she'd lay 
Then he drove to old man Ed Sutterton's place 
To find him some peace 
He got there round about twelve 
And he stayed till three 
And the sun left him down in the valley 
But the moon met him up in the hills by the lake 
Reflecting the ghost of ma's place 

Suppertime came and went 
No one heard from him 
Sis left his food on the plate 
At the end of the table right next to ma's place 
Where nobody'd sit 

The telephone rang bout four 
My sister answered it 
And I felt the news through the floor boards 
Like a long, sullen moan 
Like a wreck on the road 
Like a joining of hands 

So, I drove to town yesterday 
To pick out his grave 
I found the lot where they'd lay 
And then I drove 
To old man Ed Sutterton's place 
To find me some peace",PA,2005

To the peaceful valley 
Down the winding river 
To your city your soul 
I've grown so tired 
And my hearts grown heavy 
To walk any longer 
To your cities of gold

But I can never seem to get enough 
All my life I've been rocked into the darkness 
With a gun to my head 

Trying to find a peaceful song 
Trying to find a peaceful song 
To sing when everything goes wrong 
Till the peaceful valley calls me home 

Up there in the clouds 
In that glorious kingdom 
Tell me there ain't nothing but an easy recline 
Can I still smoke my cigarettes and have my coffee 
Up there in heaven with a bottle of wine 
Cause all my life, I've longed for forgiveness 
But I can never seem to get enough 
All my life I've been rushed into the darkness

Cause its only getting worse 
Go and fill it up with silver bullets 
Cause I can't see the sun

I'm the wolves at the door 
You're not supposed to let in

And I can't see the sun 
I know it's gone away 
And I can't be the one

You can't make me stay",Silver Bullets,2005

Moving way to slow for whatever they've been carryin' 
I've been working hard ever since I was a kid 
Trains moan in my sleep

Trains moan in my sleep when I'm trying to go to bed

Ryan Adams,"Rose lived on the south side of town 
Until her landlord showed up with two hundred dollar bills
A notice of eviction on the other hand
Now she don't live there no more
And everyone thinks he drowned

I pulled into Mecklenburg on them trains
Into a station that got flooded when they opened up the dam
And broke their connections to the railway lines
So they could blast into the quarry
And for every load of granite
We got a ton of worry

One night at the diner over eggs
Over easy she showed me the length of her legs
But that gold plated cross on her neck, it was real
And you don't get that kind of money from pushing meal

I should've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, but I lied
To most any drifter whose looking for work is too weird
I met your sister and I married her in July
But if only to be closer to you, Caroline

Percy and I moved down the street
Until we lost two pretty girls
One was seven and one was three
Alderman and Caroline owned the house right up the hill
Where we laid those babies down
So they could still see our house

Suspicion got the best of old Alderman Haint
He owned an auto parts store off the interstate
But the lord took him home in July
And then Rose spilled the beans on the day that he died
We was in trouble 

I should've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, but I lied
Tied up to concrete at the bottom of the quarry
With a tattoo on his heart that spelled out ""Caroline""
He was silent but his rosary
Well, it drifted into the custody
Of a sheriff that was just deputized

And I was down at the banquet hall
When two guys came up, pretty angry and drunk
And I'm still here at the banquet hall
At the banquet hall
Where the gun went off in the Carolina rain
In the Carolina rain

But I don't understand

I'm waiting on someone that just won't show
And every night it seems like there's no tomorrow
Not that you will ever know

I don't know
Somebody go and ask Clair

Strawberry blonde with curls
She gets hair done then she gossips
With the younger waitress girls at the bar
The old Irish rose
Drinking strawberry wine

He was angry about a letter he received from his friend

He sold his apartment before they made him move

He sent a letter to his friend
Explaining one night on coke

And tears of gold precede the rapture

And tears of gold fall on the grave
Tears of gold
Tears of golden restraint
As evidence of the pain that we feel inside

Mary-Anne settle down, let's bring the band around, how 'bout?
And we'll sing you to Heaven and back
Laura-Lee sets the food out on the tabletop for us
And when she asked Mary-Anne to say grace
Mary-Anne settles down wiping tears of gold from her face

Where we are strong by tomorrow we will grow weak and disappear
Our families all gather round to remember
Where we are flesh and blood, by the next one
We are dust under the wheels
Without a love, we are only ashen urns of silver

One Christmas I got a funeral and they handed me the receipt
How many lies I'd tell without my tongue
Get twisted into memories till I believe 'em some

I had a firecracker waiting to blow
Breakin' like a rocket who was makin' its way
To the cities of Mexico
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A
I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold
But I've been broken up and busted up since

And love don't play any games with me, anymore
Like she did before
The world won't wait, so I better shake
That thing right out there through the door
Hell, I still love you, New York

Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds
Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good
Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place
When I was drunk and I was thinking of you
Every day the children they were singing their tunes
Out on the streets and you could hear from inside
Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd
I would wait for you and I'd try to hide

And love won't play any games with me, anymore
If you don't want it to
The world won't wait and I watched you shake
But honey, I don't blame you
Hell, I still love you, New York

I remember Christmas in the blistering cold
In a church on the upper west side
Babe, I stood there singing, I was holding your arm
You were holding my trust like a child
Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue be	
But I tried to keep the overhead low
Farewell to the city and the love of my life
At least we left before we had to go

Tell me it's okay if you'll fix everything
'Cause I let go

Pink as a rose the sunsets fading
Shattering the light on the oceanside
Standing alone, I am not waiting
Maybe I'm asleep, my heart is paralyzed

Down the road 'cause we fell in
But down the road
Hanging round the wish-it-well
It's a slippery slope
And I let go, let go, let go, let go again",Let Go,2014
Ryan Adams,"I fall, in the cutting room
Straight to the fall, before the film is through
Today in my head, that field of reason why
Come a little closer, honey
And touch the fire
How long do I have here with you?
The flowers that once were a new
Shadows

Heaven waits, in the darkness of a room
And the shaking at the gates,
From here to Timbuktu
Cold front rolls in, like a black balloon
And it sinks into your soul
And you tell it what you knew

How long do I have here with you?
How long do I have here with you?
How long?
The flowers that once were anew
Are shadows

The mystery of the stars
That fell from your eyes
Watch it as it burns
Like I'm sitting on fire
That mountain is tall
And you know you'll have to climb
Put your arms around me
And let's go for a ride

You took a Polaroid of us, then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?

We were built to fall apart, then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck

To move the furniture so we could dance
Like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?

Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said ""I'm setting you free""

Ryan Adams & the Cardinals,"Mockingbirds sing
Sing me what the Lord was singing
On the day He made the water
The color of the blues
Sing me that song
Sing me till the heavens rising
On the day He made the water
The color of my baby's eyes

Love her in the way you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
It must not be enough
'Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
And if you give up

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
The rivers they run
They run until they get too tired
Until they run behind the houses
And they become the creek
When I was a child
I ran until the creek became the river
When it turned into the ocean
I wondered why he made it so deep

Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
Must not be enough
'Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
Don't give up
'Cause in a way she's crying
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
If you give up

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love

This is the song that always comes
Don't know what I'm singing 'bout and
Don't know what for
I think about you
And I think about Rosebud

Wish there was a song to sing
To bring you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take care of myself
And my friends

You sing to a field of trees
And roses singing those melodies
Simple and easy where everything moves
Underneath you
And Rosebud too

I wish there was a song to sing
To get you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess

I got nothing to say to you now
Lose the feelings that are weighing me down

It's turning morning all the birds sing
I'm not complicating anything
I'll have another and then I'll go to bed
And dream of you

Cause it's almost over
Yeah it's almost gone

I can feel the sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you now

You and I used to shine like a jewel
But time's been nothing to us but cruel
So play it out and never play the fool
Cause you'll lose everytime

We were nothing,we were only the past
Hard times like that don't last
I've been forgiven,I've been surpassed

I can't resolve

You never knew me but you did you're best
I'm just lonely inside I guess
You gave me everything you really tried
Thanks

If we are nothing and we're only the past
Well I'm just living in a dream I guess
A long black dream that takes me down the river to you

And lays me across the bed till I close my eyes
Stirs me in the morning till I can ever be satisfied
I leave Carolina every night in my dreams
Like the girls that try to love me that I only leave
Rock me like a baby doll and hold me to your chest
But I'm always moving too fast

If I could find my way back home, where would I go?
When everything about me, I used to be,
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
Lost out in the woods were you're looking for me

When, when will you come back home
No one leave the lights on in a house
Where nobody lives anymore
Loaded like the boxes up in the bedroom
Coming off the hinges like the door
The shadows dancing up in the window
They're not who we are but who we were
And I'm not gonna break, but if I do
I'm gonna shatter like the glass I turned your heart into
I'm broken like the windows in the house where I used to live
And If I could find my way back home, where would I go?

And the trains run like snakes

With a sky full of nothing but moon 
And I lose my reflection in a bottle of wine

The waitress tries to give me change, I say 
""Nah its cool. you just keep it""

Then he drove to old man Ed Sutterton's place

And he stayed till three 
And the sun left him down in the valley 
But the moon met him up in the hills by the lake 
Reflecting the ghost of ma's place 

Suppertime came and went 
No one heard from him 
Sis left his food on the plate 
At the end of the table right next to ma's place 
Where nobody'd sit

My sister answered it 
And I felt the news through the floor boards 
Like a long, sullen moan 
Like a wreck on the road 
Like a joining of hands

Thought I was supposed to be

Who wont let himself be

Down in a hole, losin' my soul

But my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all
The stones in their place
Ive eaten the sun so my tongue
Has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty
Of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more
Of my feelings beneath

Bury me softly in this womb
Oh I want to be inside of you
I give this part of me for you
Oh I want to be inside of you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers (oh I want to be inside of you)
In a tomb... In bloom
Oh I want to be inside...

Down in a hole, losin' my soul
Down in a hole, feelin' so small
Down in a hole, outta control

They will lead you home

There was never anywhere to go

Hands inside of hands
Hearts inside of hearts
Like eyes closed
Side by side and through

Our memories are attics in those houses on the hill
Our love is there above us holding everything so still

It?s curved as woman's side as far off as I feel inside
Gravity, it?s heavier than my fear, it pulls me to a new conclusion
The light of you is the weight that keeps me here

I wake up with my soul on fire
I'm swimming in my heart's desire
Not drowning in somebody's wake
Not smiling for somebody's sake

Why don't you just stay here in the sun?
It beats me why you disappear, honey
Ain't I your beloved one

My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one
My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one

I see you blue eyed old and gray
Still up all night 'til break of day
You dance me across the kitchen floor
You still got one eye on the door

How you love me with them halfway eyes
And when I think there's nothing left
I think of love and all the time it buys

My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one
My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one

Late light of the desert made the mountains a silhouette
It?s curved as a woman's side as far off as I feel inside

For everything but this.

So let us down

Let us down easy lord
Let us down easy lord

It comes rising off the hillside slopes
Down here this neighborhood
It's just the dumps
With cars iced up, perfect for writing on if
You're wearing gloves

Every season I spend alone
Feels like a thousand in my heart and soul
So let me down if you must, But let us down
Easy lord, Let us down easy
Lord if you let us down

Instead of praying I tell god these jokes he must
Be tired of himself so much he must be more
Than disappointed Christmas comes we eat alone
A pretty smile surrounds a pretty girl who
Takes your order she yells it and cries alone in
The backroom once in a while until it stops
So let her down easy if you must
But let her down easy

Hands on your head till you all calm down

Hey hey, what do you say
Is everybody scared of the man these days?
Scared to be you, scared to be me
Scared to believe that you can see
People in need, burstin' at the seams

Oh no, where do you go?
Blisters on your feet with your frozen toes
Everybody's tryin' to save your soul
Teachin' you things you already know

Hey hey, what can you say?
The cops will tazer all of your brains
Can't be sayin' them crazy things
Ain't enough money in change these days

Corporate money singin' jing a ling
Won't you believe in the president's ways?
Give your rights away and say hurray
Hurray

Hey hey, what can say?
They pulled the plug on your membrane
Back to the streets with dope to blame
Puttin' your voice back in its place

Hey hey, what can you say?
You think that they can change their ways
I bet they can if they get paid
Prozac will come save the day

Hey hey, what can you say?
The big man spends your hard earned pay
Yellow brick roads have turned to clay
Chokin' blue collars to a dollar a day

Hey hey, what can you say?
Shut your mouth or get in the way
Speak your mind or go insane
It's a choice that you can make

How long can you get along?
Do you really need to drop them bombs?
Write your words down on a bong
Roll that joint and smoke this song",Hey Hey Hurray,2009

I thought I run into a friend of mine
Ended up that he was just a stranger
I said hello as he passed me by

But then he turned and put a gun to my head
He said, my friend I'm going to rob you blind
I said you must be down on your luck
I'm out of money and I'm all out of time

He pulled the trigger and I fell to my knees
My spirit left and then my body went cold
I'm looking down upon the lights of the city
I feel alive, but I'm dead and gone

Ain't no more walking down the side of the road
Ain't no more sleeping on the edge of a frown
Ain't no more favors from someone I don't know
'Cause there ain't nobody hear me, nobody's around

Hallelujah, he's dead and gone
Hallelujah, something's wrong

Another day with my feet on the ground
I miss living and living misses me
I miss it so much that I'm holding me down

For all the things that I never could change
For all the reasons that I never understood why

I feel alone, baby
I'm dead and gone, baby
There's somethings wrong
'Cause you know I still feel alive

My train is rolling down the line
And I'm waiting 'till it bring me a dream
For holding you up in my eyes
Oh feel my love, honey
From up above, honey
Oh don't give up on me 'cause I'm coming down

I'm not a flat liner
I've everything in between the harmony you're singing loud

Half drunk I stumble on the whiskey from the bar
Sleepin' on the Santa Monica pier with the junkies and the stars
For when I woke a Spanish cross, was reachin' for my hand
Then the stranger took the place, the words I couldn't understand

And there's nothin' but the ground
It's the only place I found
Where I can lay my head in town

Down on the boulevard, the sidewalk shuffles change
Cracked out from the night before, hallucinatin' in the rain
So I borrowed me a quarter for a call to the other side
I told God that the whole damn world was waitin' in line to die

In this world, we have gone
Out on our own, all alone in stone
Looking for time that passes us by
You tired and old you may get left behind
In this world we hope to see
Invisible signs of our democracy so
Maybe somehow we all can say
That it's worth the blood that we leave on the stage

For in this world we make a stand
For suffering minds of unknown lands
But the water balloon are 2 left feet
Can never rise above our political heat
For in this world we voice and
It's lout as hell if we have the choice
Don't consume them best to fill your lives
Then we feed our kids what we leave behind
In this world we have to shake and

Man the hand that button breaks
If we hesitate we not forget
About the hard ticks written for last month's rent, mhm
How in the hell can we progress
If we're all out of work hooked on pills for stress
They tell us, up in heaven there is food for eat
But for now all we get is this shit on the street

For in this world we just can't trust
And food stamps filling our bellies up
Homeless kids on forgotten roads
Let's hope they can bear when the winter cold cause
The spark within the youngest eye
Can slowly fade with the whisper cry
So lend your heart and all you know
And relieve the pain so the good can grow

Except for my baby and me

I was born a cowboy
Way out west in New Mexico
Time's were tough, we had to let it go
We moved to town but they couldn't move it out of me

For the pills in the bottom of a bottle
To dig a deep grave with a shovel
And bury everything that a young boy needs

Ryan Bingham,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

I thought I run into a friend of mine
Ended up that he was just a stranger
I said hello as he passed me by

Then he turned and put a gun to my head
He said, ""My friend I'm going to rob you blind""
I said ""You must be down on your luck
I'm outta money and I'm all out of time""

He pulled the trigger and I fell to my knees
My spirit left and then my body went cold
I'm looking down upon the lights of the city
I feel alive, but I'm dead and gone

Ain't no more walking down the side of the road
Ain't no more sleeping on the edge of a frame
Ain't no more favors from someone I don't know
Cause there ain't nobody to hear me, nobody's around

Hallelujah, he's dead gone
Hallelujah, somethings wrong

So tell me now if your singing can bring me
Another day with my feet on the ground
I miss living and living misses me
I miss it so much that I'm holding me down
For all the things that I never could change
For all the reasons that I never understood and why
I feel alone baby
I'm dead and gone baby
There's somethings wrong
Cause you know I still feel alive
My train is rolling down the line
And I'm waiting for it to bring me the dream
Of holding you up in my eyes

Open my love honey
I'm up above honey
Oh don't give up on me
Cause I'm coming down
I'm not a one nighter
I ain't a flat liner

Of all the things I've had and lost, your love I miss the most.
And he'll will have to pay, I went a little bit too far I'd say.

Half drunk I stumble on the whiskey from the bar.
Sleepin' on the Santa Monica pier with the junkies and the stars.
For when I woke a Spanish cross, was reachin' for my hand.
And a stranger took the place, the words I couldn't understand.
And there's nothin' but the ground, it's the only place I found.
Where I can lay my head in town.

Down on the boulevard, the sidewalk shuffles change.
Cracked out from the night before, hallucinatin' in the rain.
So I bought me a quarter full, I call to the other side.
And told God that the whole damn world was waitin' in line to die.

If you stray there is no change, in the end you're gonna fall

'Cause you know I'm barely hanging on
Take my love, take all my love until it's gone

It's mine for the taking
I just wanna take you down
Been so much time in the making
I can feel you giving up
I can feel you (oh oh, oh oh)
I can feel you (oh oh, oh oh)

Yeah, yeah, 
One touch, one scent, all it takes to have me convinced
Think about you when I'm not around you
Who would have thought it would have came to this
'Cause you mine now (mine now), any time now (time now)
Why you lyin' now? 'Cause it's making sense
So when I see you smile there's no mistaking this
So what do we do, feed to
Eye to eye you can read through
Sell the world we can breach through
My intention is just to please you
And it's fading now, no wait
Same way for me navigate
End the line this love statement
This all mine so I got to take it

It's mine for the taking

Burn it down (Down), down, down, down

You build me up, you build me up
To watch me fall, and turn to dust
Is this the place, I used to love?
Can't take no more, I've had enough
So burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

They lift you up and preach you
Then try to pull you down and beat you
They're no longer peaceful
Never knew a buddy would become see-through
Make it up so high, they can't reach you
They just feel the wind beneath you
Camaraderie's a plum oddity, with some modesty
People abolish he who lovin' me never a dollar tree wanted
But they wanna demolish me, question mark
When they know I'm blessed at heart
Try to test Tech when I poke at they chest and bark
Givin' my blood, sweat, tears and flesh in art
But they come in my circle and make a mess, then dart
I feel like they wishin' for me to be dissin' so they can be quick and then witness me (falling down)
Gotta know that'll never happen, forever rappin'
So burning it down is the mission
Dismissin' got a brand new condition, I'm (balling now)
Kill 'em in a really clever fashion

You build me up, you build me up
To watch me fall, and turn to dust
Is this the place, I used to love?
Can't take no more, I've had enough
So burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Why would a good businessman sign a artist
And he really believes he rhymes the hardest
And spend a lot of money and time just to start it
And you think he don't want you to make it sounds ret
Uh, Trav ain't the target, I ain't the puppet
If you got negativity boy, you better tuck it
Givin' everything and they trippin', I had enough
It took me a while for this menace and now, fuck it
Give 'em a record deal, plus the CDs
Take 'em all on tour to give 'em the ups
Put 'em on my record, I do my verse and then I send it to them so I can give 'em the ups
In the long run, they ain't givin' a fuck
Said I ain't takin' care of my day ones
If I wasn't, they wouldn't wait to spray guns
Makin' the people think I'm wrong is way dumb, nigga
Now I'm tired, hearing my empire's (falling down)
But it's really the opposite, and I've got a clear
So many more Os, fake family, fake friends, and foes (crawling now)
But Tech N9na's outta here

You build me up, you build me up
To watch me fall, and turn to dust
Is this the place, I used to love?
Can't take no more, I've had enough
So burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Once and for all they'll be blood on the wall if they doubt us
They think they're running this town, but this town will shut down without us

You can take it all away
I don't need it, it's not me
You can take it all, take it all away
I'll still be the same

Are you hiding still?
Don't you want to love yourself?
Don't you know that someone will?

I'm going down and I lost a piece of mind
Show me how to find my other life

'Cause I'm in between lights
I just need another day
Yeah, I'm in between lights
Yeah, I know I'm on my way
I'm holding on, I see the sun
But I'm in between lights, I'm in between lights

I left my hand by the side of the road
Suitcase, ticket and I'm ready to go
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

The feel's not bothering all time
The sky's getting bigger
Drinking in like wine
Maybe, just maybe we'll be alright

'Cause I'm in between lights
I just need another day
Yeah, I'm in between lights
Yeah, I know I'm on my way
I'm holding on, I see the sun

In this waxed and empty box
Twisted nights, drowned in wine
Dropping shots in empty bars

Broken glass, moments past
Hold now, the dog barks
Broken windows, broken doors
Broken chairs on broken floors

All these things remind me of you

I rise away, don't feel no pain
'Cause you're with me now
In time it seems a slower song
It's a perfect sound

Sleep right through the day and we fade away
You flow right through my veins
Like a morning rain
Like a morning rain, yeah

Down the stairs to neon rooms
Blink eyes and cheap perfumes
All these strangers getting strange
Feeding off each other's pain

I crawl inside, inside my head
Rusty springs and burning beds
Frozen people, frozen lungs
Frozen buildings block the sun

All these things remind me of you

I rise away, don't feel no pain
'Cause you're with me now
In time it seems a slower song

Sleep right through the day and we fade away

Alone, my home, a wasted view

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

That now our dreams

There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love

A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

But you'll call?

And though you looked so cute
In your polyester suit

It's wool

You're right, I'd never fall for you at all

And maybe this appeals
To someone not in heels
Or to any girl who feels
There's some chance for romance

With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips


And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

I look for the spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in your eye

Ryan Kelly,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line on your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms",Brothers In Arms,2008

You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody, before it's too late.",Desperado,2008

Is the baddest part of town 
And if you go down there 
You better just beware

You see he stand about six foot four 
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover"" 
All the men just call him ""Sir""

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown 
The baddest man in the whole damned town 
Badder than old King Kong 
And meaner than a junkyard dog 

Now Leroy, he a gambler 
And he likes his fancy clothes 
And he likes to wave his diamond rings 
In front of everybody's nose 
He got a custom Continental 
He got an Eldorado too 
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun 
He got a razor in his shoe 

[Chorus]

Now Friday 'bout a week ago 
Leroy shootin' dice 
And at the edge of the bar 
Sat a girl named Doris 
And ooh that girl looked nice 
Well he cast his eyes upon her 
And the trouble soon began 
And Leroy Brown learned a lesson 'bout messin'
With the wife of a jealous man

Well the two men took to fighting 
And when they pulled them from the floor 
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle 
With a couple of pieces gone

From the midnight well
For it's dark and evil, so they say
The midnight well

They'll tell you a tale of a lovely young maid
The fairest that they'd ever known
What a beauty, they say
But she went her own way
On that night, she set out on her own

For they say, she had a rendezvous
At the midnight well
With a gypsy man she barely knew
At the midnight well

Nobody knew where he came from
But they remember the fire in his eyes
His earring of gold
And his hair black as coal
And a look that could just hypnotize

When he said
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Never more, they never saw her face
At the midnight well
She was gone, and never left a trace
At the midnight well

They say when the summer nights come to an end
The harvest moon glows in the sky
A black horse will appear and a sound you will hear
As the ghost of a gypsy flies by

And he says
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away

Only for nights in Ballygran
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean for my love to find

But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
And nor have I the wings to fly
If I could find me a lonesome boatman
To ferry me over my love and I

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy time I spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like the melted snow

So I’ll spend my days in endless roving
Soft is the grass my bed is free
Ah, to be home now in Carrickfergus
On that long road down to the sea

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink

Its more than just a physical thing, i know
Its something like a spiritual connection
I feel it in my soul heart and mind

The sweetest thing is what you are
From you, I'll never be to far,
Please say forever you will stay beside me

Your beautiful like the colours of the rainbow
Warm heated like the rays of the sun on summer days
All i got to do is look into your eyes to lose myself
Your the substance of my dreams, epitome of women
The only one i truly call mine

Oh when i think of love i think of you
Baby i love you, baby i need you.",When I Think of You,2006

I know it's over

And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Ever since I spied you
In the rooms of my mind
Now I can't deny you
Bleeding and bruised
Like a vagabond in rags
I've walked the streets to your door
To find just what's in store
I see you
You and many others
In your clean well-lighted place
Where I would find disgrace
But I do
Know I'd find contentment
Just to be your furniture
I need nothing more

Crawl beneath the lowest hell

Tell me why you're here tonight
Are you looking for someone to do you right
I see you standing by yourself
And I heard you're stepping for somebody else
Came up to you
So I approached you on the wall
I Started off by saying beautiful
And then I saw
That you already had a man
Cause I noticed the ring on your hand

[Bridge: Slim]
So I thought to myself slow it down, cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm starting to get closer now, cause I'm feeling that this might be destiny
And I'm dancing with you although its wrong
And I cant help but notice you're feeling it
And there's really no use holding out, cause I know its that good love you need
I can give it to you baby

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
If its good love you need, I give good lovin'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down
Its good love you need, I give good loving'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down

[Verse 2]
Imagine if you came with me, and imagine all the things that we can do
Me and you can make it work so easily, baby I can see it in the way you move
The way you move
I get it from the way you dip, from the way you're biting on your bottom lip
I know you want it
Cause even though you got a man, you're still taking me by the hand

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I got that good love
You ain't heard of me by now, well you should've
What you been under a rock or you're just outta touch
I know you work, go to school, and don't get out as much
So if you let me baby, I'ma let you whats good
A TV with HD wouldn't show as good 
I got that fogging up the windows in the back of Jeeps
Yeah I wake that thing up, and put it back to sleep
You put it back to sleep? That's what I said right?
They do it wrong baby come get your head right
And I think everybody know what Biggie said right?
If its right is on tonight like headlights
I don't slow down, not even for red lights
You cant stop this G double O D
We can both try to fight it like ??
But you need this Loso, in case you didn't know so
Slim take us outta here

[Verse 4: Ryan Leslie]
Now I'm rolling down my tinted window
Is you coming or staying, I see you think about it girlfriend just surrender
You got a chance to make the right choice
I'm intelligent, got my money right, plus I got a nice voice
I can give you the right touch, the right place
You don't really need to be wifed up, hes lightweight
I wrote the right hook, and got you knocked out
I take you shopping, get iced up and rocked out
I know you like the picture, I'ma paint it for real
By the way I put it down slowly when I'm rolling with ya
They'll be looking for us, but well be under covers
On the journey from perfect strangers to secret lovers
Tell me all your stories, I'ma tell you mines
Ill even lie to you, tell you Ill leave the game behind
So you can feel good, but you know what it is
I'm only tryin' to get in and handle my business

Killer shoe game these are just a pair of hamies

Flabby beach mat, she don't give me no shade
Hold the heat down, she don't even know Wade

I like her soft kiss and I dig her wet throat
I love her booty bounce like cigarette boats
And it won't quit
She can't wear skinny jeans cause her ass don't fit

That for real though, just like Wanda say
She just wanna rock my world in the Wonder way
I'm sitting at the airport like Andele
Fist I saw the Luggy with the Louie monogram
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram
On the runway, just me and Bentley
I open doors, you ain't gotta G the gent me
I was thinking Knicks game, court side
She put her hands in my pants, I let that thought slide
We can get it on, but there's no leg room
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom
Now you tell me who can top this
Hey, laying on the deck topless
Got two different dames, it's a Fabolous thing
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain

The I talk,
The way we make love in the dark
Somethings in life were meant to be
I thank God above that you were sent for me
See cause my point of view is all about you
You got to tell me what you want girl

It ain't a thing, mama, anything
You need from me baby, please take this ring
It's like braille
Girl the way I feel
It's something that I can't conceal
For sure you're my light
Personified
Myself I can only try
To measure your shine
On an earthly scale
Everything else is pale
Compared to you

[Bridge]
Baby you're my cure, you're my remedy
So sincere and pure, said I'll never leave
I'll stay by your side, for eternity
Til the day I die babe
Said you're my cure, you're my remedy
So sincere and pure, said I'll never leave
I'll stay by your side, for eternity
Til the day I die because

Come and share your life with me
(Share your life with me babe)
And I'll share my life with you
(And I'll share my life with you, girl)

Anything that I may have
Anything that I'm blessed to grab
I'll split it in half
For your tender touch
Your loving girl it means so much
I'll love you in style
On a sun drenched isle
After we go down the aisle
You're the thrill in my life
Our love is amplified
The type that only God provides
And it comes from you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

And if it's love you need
I'll give it to you baby
And if you want the world on a platter
I'll give it to you baby
Said if it's up to me
I'll give it to you baby
Anything you need it don't matter
I'll give it to you baby

Tell me, if I left you out of the blue
Would you fight back tears while your heart gets torn to pieces
Cause that what I did when you
Left me out of the blue
Love can feel so good and then suddenly it's over, yea

I should've been more true, takin' better care of you,
Like I was supposed to, guess it's too late now,
I should've told you how I felt, steady thinkin' of myself,
Still I can't believe you went away so soon

Now when I ask myself
It's hard to see
How you can be anywhere but here with me
You said that you needed space and time
So you would be able to make up your mind
You said if I set you free
One day you'll be ready to come back to me
Did you really mean it? I hope you did
Hope you meant it babe

I, was on my cash grind
I had to make moves
And when I got mine, I came and get you
You couldn't believe the way I flipped it
Did it that smooth
I couldn't believe it was that easy to impress you

Its so uncanny how I knew that you were the one
You were a pretty little thing, had all the fun
I been to city after city, looking for love
I, want, you, ah
I wouldn't spend a penny though I had all the change
You made me switch now I'm thinking another way
And outta all these other women I got to say
I, want, you, ah

You can see it when you look around

Told you, you was fly, you said ""that's what they all say""

Do I look fresh enough to get her,
If I see her one I'm then I wont forget her

Tens, that's too many to count
I spin, that's a any amount
No matter to sum homey got the cash to cover it
And I when wanna see she be fast to mother it

Would I let her to it hmm, well that depends
Can she raise a young king? my blood is royal

Still push that G-55 with a super model.

I just tell 'em what they wanna hear
Soon as you don't give a fuck that's when they wanna care
She say the truth is overrated like underwear
And if the shoe fits, she want a pair
Yeah, I tell you something that you don't know
`Cause if you don't water plants, then they won't grow
I drop jewels, she pick them up and kick them up
Legs in the air and give it to me, stick them up
Tell me it's mine, tell me it's mine
Biggest lie in the world, like yeah baby I'm fine
Yeah maybe I'm lying, but I am fly
Say they see me in some trues that's a ? lie
Ah, Louie V bow made if I call names
Game time, uniform no ball game
Beautiful lies not as good as they sound
Truth to those in the box cause they couldn't be crowned
(Nice)

And if you're feelin how I'm feelin put your hands to the sky

Ryan Leslie,"Your red lights
Ain't never slowing me down, oh no no

Uh yea
My passion a reason for my existence
My success the product of my persistence
Self-made, I did it with no assistance
Luxury suite view through these Cartier lenses
Huh, and we started in the nose bleeds
No my feet up on the wood in my own seats
Court-side and it's cheap bucks versus Knicks
Watch my homie B Janice, drop 36
And that's a definition of, when pain meets love
That it turns the game, and you earn your name
Them girl come, will you earn your fame?
Get off me, I'm too hot, you can't burn a flame
And my teacher told me, that my rap dreams were ?
I still pursuit them even though I seem ridiculous
The taste of success bittersweet like licorice
A flight with the wings of Icarus
And when I achieve, I could turn with much satisfaction
To reply Michael Jackson was not ?
So back to my ? dreams of riches
More money, more balls, more rings, ?
Yet many believe in God but they ain't religious
I'm suspicious, I believe in them digits
I believe in them digits

So picture me above the sky
Shine a brighter day, sunlight
I'm a write a name in the stars
So everybody knows who we are

Yea, let the black flag fly uh
Yea, and it's a waste when this new money can't buy taste
Bought yourselves some Versace, mispronounce it Vercese
It's my time, blow your mind like an ounce to the face
Yea I do believe in miracles, heaven is so empirical
And you could see the way I climbed up the ladder
Education, Ivy League, I'm talkin mind over matter
And so called innovators is always asking for favors
Then they take the credit to the fruit of your labor
But not me, I'm a beast, that's JF Leccord Jeezy
Not many can say they play keys with Eas-E
Or they had a couple girl on their knees to please me
I can't leave the game, not yet, it still needs me

Uh, so let the black flag fly
My vision of ascending the heights that rap can't buy
It's fully realize when I open my eyes and stop dreaming
I'm stuntin' while you lames is scheming
Kiss the ring, I got the gifts of a king

So picture me above the sky
Shine a brighter day, sunlight
I'm a write a name in the stars

My 'Diamond Girl' she loves the way the precious stones adorn
And accessorize the fashionable clothes that's worn

Call the cops restraining order for showin’ up

Baby work for this camera that you're appearing on
Go, go, go and get it girl
Give me everything you got like there's no tomorrow
Go, go, I know you with it girl
Let me make this movie hot like I'm Modevar
And I know you are pleased to see me
The kitchen kind is cold but the scene is steamy
And like the re-run that you seen on TV
I'm a rub like dream of genie, that's classic

Whether you ready or not, we right here (Right here)
This is the moment for making love
I don't care if the neighbors might hear
How we get down, get down

I don't care if the neighbors might hear
How we get down, get down

So don't be scared if you ain't prepared
I know it's people everywhere and it's illegal here
But since time flies and we all die
Let's make a movie, one time for the archives (yeah)
Let's do it one time for the lovers
And one time for the haters jealous of us yea
Just give it to me girl
Baby, just give it to me
Right here, right here, right here

Ryan Lewis,"I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly
I hit back-court, and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, Mom  I touched the net, this is the best day of my life
Air Max's were next,
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread, in school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, Four stripes, some Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, but bad was so dope
And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his fours, whoa

See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted to start a cult though
Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You could clown for those Probings, with the Velcro, those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground,'cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him, I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in,
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yea, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did. See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine, off

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

I started out, with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am, what I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change, consumption is in the veins

And now I see it's just another pair of shoes",Wing$,2011
Ryan Lewis,"And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
Well city kids, you get what you ask for

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer, at least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days, I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on, close the chapter, live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes but those mistakes make you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality: rarely lit
Memories to collage, paste to the glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors, graffiti, and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain, some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again, I guess it's relative
The camera lights, the whiskey rise, sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second win
Grow a mustache, pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

So here's to the nights, dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Brought a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real, even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while, just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find out way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me

Ryan Lewis,"Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And get to give it away
My gold erupted from volcano's in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone
Now I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Five hundred thousand soul
Slick rick gold, row fun, hella cold
Yea we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since pee was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun

Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Passing space needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t of
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

Ryan Lewis,"I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I just went in and stole it, the police would of notice
Gotta be strategic, creepin', go in, leave with that motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, caseing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions
Headed in sweatin', open that front door
Interscope printed out right by the entrance, door closes
Not a metaphor, then I start towards
That front, that’s right, where you check in
Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, why shoot?
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!)
Carrying 2 cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor i’m late, paintin' jimmy iovine's office
Holding my breath ‘bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then i’m leaving town with that contract
And i’m spazzing out, grabbin' the a&r out
His chair and i’m taking him hostage
I don’t give a fuck, step into the elevator press 3
Now i’m headed up (heist!)
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And i’m ready and willing to bust ‘em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink

I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicals
But it’s weird, it’s like this room i’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
Cds boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin’ that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yea, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent
Big block silver letters, read it out loud: president (nice!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said: we’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you’re destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you’re next to be famous
Now i’m sorry, i’ve had a long day remind me, now what your name is?
That’s right, macklemore, of course, today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? we’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out we’ll need back that money that you borrowed
So it’s really like a loan, a loan? come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
We’ll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10
So shit, after taxes you and ryan have 7% to split
That’s not bad, i’ve seen a lot worse, no one will give you a better offer than us (hmm)
I replied I appreciate the offer, thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked",Jimmy Iovine,2012
Ryan Lewis,"Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd had done for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life

Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego won't swole until the karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, a necklace
What I really need is a job off Craigslist
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you

1, 2, now

Round here they sing broken hymns
The prayers flow better when I’m soaked they're gin
The air is rusty and sits in the corner
Bad bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Watch their faces, familiar places
Even if they didn’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems bail themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of fight
This crown of thorns has punched the top my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the churches
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, oh the Lord immerses
Blessed in holy water, the sin of Holy Father
Have you ever smelled bless that smells atmonic Vodka
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Comment to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens I can read up on that doctrine
The people close to me say I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got tins that scole like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, bar more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the neon cathedral

Ryan Lewis,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw,
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like,
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3,500 hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried

If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins,
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it

I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

Ryan Lewis,"One, two, now
Those 3 plus years, I was so proud of
And I threw ‘'em all away for 2 Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that he lied to me
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fuckin' privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
08-10-08, but now it's been changed in every
When they put me in some boxes that say
That I never was, it's the false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I written has all been fake
Oh well I'll just take my slip to the grave
Uh, what the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
The seep on your shoulder's the seemingly heavy weight
I haven't seen tears like this on my girl
In a while the trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth than be judged for my mistakes
Them falsely held up, give em props, loved and praised
I guess I gotta get this on the page

Feeling sick and helpless, lost the compass where self is
I know what I gotta do and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I felt you'd go
But you were with me all along along

And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober
I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the east side
Shaking tweakin', hope that they don't see it
Hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Was posted in the back with my hands crossed shooken
If they call on me I'm passing, if they talk to me I'm booking out that door
But before I can make it somebody stops me and says are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time
I just wanted to say that if it wasn't for other side I wouldn't have made it
I just look down at the ground and say thank you
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry fuck!
I barely got 48 hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I wanna tell her I relapsed but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her congrats
Get back to my car and I think I'm tripping yea
'Cause God wrote Otherside, that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man I fucked up up
Like so many others I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself, didn't turn out that good

If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cock block the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Hey man, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell, David Bowie meets Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him, celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher, I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Harring, you see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great 'cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No child left behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system, what did you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it, no light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever man, what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted an encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment, what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have
Dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls
Texts & blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it's gone

And on on, and on, and on we go

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over, over

Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me

Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy, I see me husband, you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love, maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and get all my heart throbbed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a saw, a shock at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can't get her out of my head

They say thirty is the new twenty
And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basshead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, whose got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
Acynical hispters with long hair
Cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

They say it's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge her 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less cautious
The rappers rappin' 'bout them strippers up on the pole, copping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that it's poetry is so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there is a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet, R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude, million man marchin'
Fighting for our freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talkin race, tryin' to save the fuckin' globe
Don't get involved with the causes in mind
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's nineteen ninty nine
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

And I throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (That’s what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch)
Can’t see me through my tints (Nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24’s (Umbrella)
I ain’t got 24’s (No oh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like old English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, Damn y’all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m legally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m like go fuckin their tastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whippin’ but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want a Ducati so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car, junior, problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it in the 4-2
Most of the mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms, you can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ off
Son, swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes, maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low? This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cool with niggas, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it

Make history in between the base path
And compete against the fear that is in me
That's my only barrier and I swear I'm going to break that

I was just a little shorty hoping that I could find a bum to buy a 40 for me

Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to

Probably won't get it, but I'm gonna give it everything
Play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control and my souls mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy

Ryan Malcolm,"There's a picture in my window
Of a world that sleeps outside
As still as it was midnight
Is heaven left behind?

It's a book that has no story
Shakespeare had no time
Or is it like poetry that never ever, never ever rhymes?
Baby, wait your turn 'cause you might crash and burn

And you're runnin' and runnin' just as fast as you can
'Til the ground's a blur
And you can see it, almost touch it with the palm of your hand
Watch, you don't crash and burn, crash and burn

Like a movie with no ending, fame at any cost
How do we know what's precious
If innocence, innocence is lost
So let's wait our turn before we crash and burn, oh

And you're runnin' and runnin' just as fast as you can
'Til the ground's a blur
And you can see it, almost touch it with the palm of your hand
Watch, you don't crash and burn, crash and burn

Everybody loses, oh, just before they win
Life is all surprises and here they come, oh, here they come again
Rushin' in, I'm rushin', rushin' in, I'm rushin', rushin' in, oh

And you're runnin' and runnin' just as fast as you can

Ryan Montbleau,"He was the son of a loving business man,
Young days filled with affluent affection.
Late nights all alone, walking along those suburban roads,
Searching for some cosmic connection.

And as he walked those tree-lined roads,
He would swear himself a sacred oath
To always reach up endless toward the sky.
Walking through the midnight dew
He would curse the lack of something new
And he'd stare up at the sky and wonder why'

Why it's all been done before
And so it will again.
'Nothing new left for me to do,' he said.
And it's all been done before
It''s all been tried and true and said,
There must be something somewhere out there someone left.

She was the daughter of a military man,
Each year marked by a different direction.
Seasons spent in the solitude of some transitory plan
Running from any constant connection.

And just as she might settle in
The orders came to leave again
And she'd stare down at the ground and refuse to cry.
Bags packed and off to go
She would swear herself a silent oath
To someday stay in one place just for a while'

Ever so slightly in that misty western wind.

And she sat upon her brand-new, old fence
And through the haze of the streetlight their eyes met.
Their eyes met'
Their eyes met'
And then they started up a conversation,
Just a simple little conversation
And that was it.

And though it seemed like endless nights and days
It did not take long for him to say,
'You''re the one for me, I'll buy you a diamond ring.
And together we will see the world,
Walk every inch upon this earth,
We will climb the highest mountains,
Sail the shining seas,
Do everything.'

'No, it's all been done before.
Worry not your head.
Me and you is something new,' she said.
And it's all been done before,
It's all been tried and true and said,
'I want you, not something new,' is what she said.

And he lifted up his head,
Looked her in the eye,
And said, 'I think I understand

But we will pass pleasantries, even under the gun.

Throwing fits through conduits to future generations

Spending slashing underhand
From high up not to understand

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2003
Ryan O'Neill,"Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall.

I promise you, did every little thing you ask me to
I can't believe the things I'm going through

Don't shoot me Santa Clause

But the children on the block they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

Oh, Santa
It's been a real hard year
There just ain't no getting around this
Life is hard but look at me I turned out alright

Hey, Santa
Why don't we talk about it, work it out
Believe me, this ain't what I wanted
I love all you kids, you know that, hell

I remember when you were just 10 years old
Playing out in the desert
Just waiting for a sip of that
Sweet Mojave rain

In the sweet Mojave rain
The boy was on his own

Don't shoot me Santa Clause
I've been a clean living boy
I promise you, did every little thing you ask me to
I can't believe the things I'm going through

Hey, Santa Clause
No one else around believes me
But the children on the block they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

They had it coming, so, why can't you see
I couldn't turn my check no longer
The sun is going down and Christmas is near
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever

Don't shoot me Santa Clause
No one else around believes me
But the children on the street they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

And my suitcase packed with my master plan
With my lucky penny swinging around my neck

For someone to say well done
For someone to say good job!

Or begrudge me if I'm right!

And being what you want
Leave it on your desk
Don't leave it in your bag
But I've got the view to get me home
The means to get me there
The fire in my soul, and the lighter in my hand
And I disagree what I've been told
To listen to myself,
I'm my one and only man who can make me who I am

But you tossed a coin to pick my path
To even out my odds 
Two faced that leaves me blind
So you can leave me in the cold

Still I'm standing in the dark
With the one hand holding on to night 
And one to day

Take my time to reach the canyon
Smooth talking
The only thing that slows me down from fast thinking
To the day I missed the way
I was fire!
Move closer!
Nothing matters when you're out, you're
Not nothing
Till you let your feelings go, that
Tight fisted
No expression face you have
It won't work!

And once more knockin' on my door
Is a tax collector

And I'm going see
There's too many bills, too many pills
To many features and too many frills
No money, too many things to buy
Too many ways to split the pie

I got to simplify
I got to simplify
My life I say simplify
I got to simplify

I got to smell the flowers
Enjoy the ride
I got to open up my eyes
And see what's outside

All the things, I miss each day
'Cause I'm drivin in the fast lane
And it's makin' me insane
And I don't wanna be that way
I wanna be free today

From the responsibilities it brings
Excess distress
I got to enjoy more
And stress less
Simplify

I got to simplify
I got to simplify
My life I say, simplify
I got to simplify

Well that's great, I'm late
'Cause I'm always in a hurry for a meetin'
In the state of confusion
A delusion, an illusion
I'm takin' much too far

I'm always livin' in the future or the past
The time flies to fast
I got to make it last
So enjoy it, relax, chill out
We just give it a try

I say simplify
I got to simplify
My life I say simplify
I got to, got to, got to simplify

Ryan Shupe & the Rubberband,"When you cry, be sure to dry your eyes,
Cause better days are sure to come.
And when you smile, be sure to smile wide,
And don't let them know that they have won.
And when you walk, walk with pride,
And don't show the hurt inside,
Because the pain sill soon be gone.

[Chorus]
And when you dream, dream big,
As big as the ocean, blue.
Cause when you dream it might come true.
For when you dream, dream big.

And when you laugh, be sure to laugh out loud,
Cause it will carry all your cares away.
And when you see, see the beauty all around and in yourself,
And it will help you feel okay.
And when you pray, pray for strength to help to carry on,
But when the troubles come your way.

Around and in yourself, and it will help you feel okay.

Help to carry on when the troubles come your way.

Ryan Shupe & the Rubberband,"I should've known she wouldn't listen
I should've known she'd pass me by
I should've know better than to
Listen to the lullaby

'cause it's a sad, sad song I hear
And a long, long road I'll fear
Without you, without you

Would you love me?
Always trust me?
Would you love me if it won't hurt you at all?
If it won't hurt you at all

I should've known she'd leave me standin'
I should've known she wouldn't go
I should've known better than to
Turn on the television show

'cause everytime I look I see
The wrong episode is me
Without you, without you

Would you love me?
Always trust me?
Would you love me if it won't hurt you at all?
If it won't hurt you at all

So please be careful my heart
Right from the start
'cause it's not that easy comin' down
Before it all falls apart
Would it be so plain to see?

Would you love me?
Always trust me?
Would you love me if it won't hurt you at all?
If it won't hurt you at all, if it won't hurt you at all
If it won't hurt you at all

You better change if I ask you. 
So tell me what is the matter with this, 
They say it starts with just one kiss.

Every dollar has become a dime
Hearts breaking at the speed of sound
Falling down, all around

Bombs lighting up the eastern sky
The backroom deals and the bottom lines
The Earth's shaking, but we don't know why
A million fires, oceans rise

I leave it all when I feel you near
What I'm saying is I need you here
Even though love never seems to last
If you think we’ve got a chance

Stay awhile
Oh you got to stay awhile
These days are wild
So baby, won't you stay awhile

Drop the needle on the belle brigade
We slow dance till the moonlight fades
Tell me now that you'll never leave
Always stay, here with me

Keep me safe from the circus show
The bullshit and the blowing smoke
The knife hidden under every sleeve
Stab your back, watch you bleed

They’re gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Like I can make you a star next year
Well, if New York city's lights are so bright
How come so many people cry tonight

Stay awhile
Oh you got to stay awhile
These days are wild
So baby, won't you stay awhile

Let your hair fall around your face
I would kill just to keep you safe
Put your body next to mine
Just let go, and close your eyes

I shiver when I feel your skin
Like a sinner who's been forgiven
Go on, baby, shine your light
'Cause no one's gonna find us here tonight

With tears in her eyes from years of the lies
She backed on up and disappeared out the drive
Wait, hey, what can I say?
All we had means nothin today
I did my thing and she did hers
But my crimes are a wee bit worse
And now I'm sittin here all alone with my guilt
Just me and the dogs in the home that we built
It was Andy's and hers, even though Bubba bought it
But Bubba wouldn't leave just like her mother called it
from the pink, only to the blue blame
God forgive me for causin you pain
All it was, ain't no more
Cause my baby's gone and when it rains it pours

She tried to tell me I needed to be strong
I wasn't listening and now my baby's gone

One for the pleasure, two for the sin
Three for the family we could a been
Had I not been so concerned
with this life, no spoken words
Could begin to undue what's done
Deep within I know that you must run
Far away, from the thought of my smile
And the broken dream of us walkin that aisle
I first saw +Betty+ in my Nanny White's yard
The breast where the best, and the fanny my lord
A fly country girl, just workin them gifts
She's my queen, was a virgin I guess
But I ain't never ask and I ain't never tell
But Betty had the cash every time I went to jail
And how did I reward her loyalty
Let her walk in and see her cousin Joy on me

Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
It's been six months and still no word
I try to carry on like it still don't hurt
Hoes come around but I still won't flirt
Drinking's worse and the pills don't work
Last I heard she was in Birmingham
Livin with a good hard workin man
And lookin back on it, that's exactly what she wanted
Not a rebel with a passion for the moment
I live for the fiddle and the kick in the snout
I take my love and I stick it in there
Moved a Jimmy and made this song
All because my baby's gone

Ryan Tedder,"Time to say goodbye, it’s time to make a move
Nothing left to hide, everything to lose
There is not a day I wake, not a step that I take
When I don’t see your ghost, I think you should know

It’s time for both of us to put aside our past
We’re looking forward now, strong enough to last
There’s not a night I sleep, not a dream that I keep
If I don’t see your face, it’s you I can’t replace

You’re running through my mind
Baby all the time, it’s not over yet
Deep inside my soul
This I know for sure, it’s not over yet

You’re running through my mind
Baby all the time, it’s not over yet
Deep inside my soul
This I know for sure, it’s not over yet

Every single night I dream of love
Every single day I’m thinking love
With every thought of you I’m still in love
Don’t say goodbye 'cuz it’s not over yet
(Every night, every day)
Not over yet
(Every night, every day)

You’re running through my mind
Baby all the time, it’s not over yet
Deep inside my soul
This I know for sure, it’s not over yet

You’re running through my mind

This I know for sure, it’s not over yet

",Not Over,2006
Ryan Tedder,"No, it never crossed my mind
You might try to hide from me
You would set the place on fire
With your long and broken wrecking shriek

Always aiming for the truth
Sometimes missing just one word
Something really shaken loose
Look around to the see the cities burn

It's just the way I'm feelin'
We're lost without the meanin'
The love has disappeared without a trace

It's just the way I'm feelin'
You're gone and now I'm leavin'
I'm holding back the tears
Look at my face
It's just the way I'm feelin'

You were never forced to choose
I tried to keep you safe from harm
And now there's nothing left to lose
You've gone and torn my world apart
All that's left for me is you
I'm a shadow of my former self

It's just the way I'm feelin'
But lost without the meanin'
Love has disappeared without a trace

It's just the way I'm feelin'
You're gone and now I'm leavin'
I'm holding back the tears
Look at my face

It's just the way I'm feelin'
We're lost without the meanin'

And damn, I use to love that song when it came on

And no this ain't 'bout no new company
It's just time for you to do you and me to do me
And you know, and you know that I know, that I know
That we don't belong together no more, no more

Use to get along better back when we was homies
Use to keep it low key, now we fight in public
Argue about anything and every single subject

So now I think it's better if we just keep it movin'
I won't trip off you and you won't trip off what I'm doin'
'Cause baby, this ain't crackin' like it use to be

Quite honest with ya,
I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?

Yeah right, you're better off trying to freeze hell

And others do it for the retails

But I do it for the kids, life through the tower head on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in the corner like mick, baby, til the end

Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home

Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life till we're dead.
Give me scars, give me pain

Here comes a fighter

And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, Loserville, nothing town

Textbook version of the kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling kiss my a**
It's gonna take a couple right hooks, a few left jabs
For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad

Joyful, Joyful 
Lord we adore Thee 
An' in my life 
I put none before Thee 
'Cause since I was a youngster 
I came to know 
That you was the only way to go 

So I had to grow an´ come to an understandin´ 
That I´m down with the King so now I´m demandin´ 
That you tell me who you down with, see 
'Cause all I know is that I´m down with G-O-D 
You down with G-O-D? 
(Yeah, you know me) 
You down with G-O-D? 
(Yeah, you know me) 
You down with G-O-D? 
(Yeah, you know me) 
Who´s down with G-O-D? 
(Everybody) 

Come and join the chorus 
The mighty, mighty chorus 
Which the morning stars begun 
The Father of love is reigning over us 

Right away 
What have you done for Him lately? 
Ooh, ooh, ooh yeah 
What have you done for Him lately? 

He watches over everything 
So we sing 

Joyful, Joyful 
Lord, we adore Thee 
God of glory 
Lord of love 
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee 
Hail Thee as the sun above 
Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness 
Drive the dark of doubt away 
Drive it away 
Giver of immortal gladness ( won´t you) 
Fill us ( Fill us with the light of day, Lord, fill us) 
Fill us ( oh we need You, yes we do, fill us) 
Fill us ( yeah, oh, oh yeah) 
Fill us ( with the light of day, Lord) 
( We need you, come right away, 
We need you, need you today, we need you, 
I´m here to say fill us, fill us, fill us, fill us) 

Fill us with the light of day ( oh, yeah) 
Light of day!","Joyful, Joyful",1996
