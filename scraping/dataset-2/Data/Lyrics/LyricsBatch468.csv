Joe Bonamassa,"Well I'm a man of the mountain
I'm just made of dirt
Of this Earth I traveled
Like a shepherd and his herd

And I said hang on, hang on
Black lung heartache

I sleep in a modest house
These green hills I mind
And if I plow tend my children
Who will be by the side?

And I said hang on, hang on
Black Lung Heartache

I've shed many tears
Seems I can't shed no more
You can see them on the table
You can see 'em on the floor

Now I said hang on, hang on
Black lung heartache

I've seen many men
They become hard as nails
Carrying the hammers like keys to a jail

Now I said hang on, hang on
Black lung heartache

Now I said so long, so long
Black lung heartache",Black Lung Heartache,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"I'm gonna make my own way
I'm gonna head downtown
Walk around, settle down,
Find me a proper drink
Don't need a helmet
To get me through life
I walk across the water
Blame it on foolish pride

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
the classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Diamonds and pearls
You're that kind of girl
You size me up, to break me down
While you're sipping on your crown royal
I'll give you shelter
Babe, it's your call
It's hard to find truth within
When you're living in your own zone

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
the classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Pride and deception
The same kind of pain
And all that's left for me to lose
Is meant for you to gain
Playing it close
Stealing your time
But who cares anyway?
I've gone the extra mile

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
the classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Living in a Dust Bowl",Dust Bowl,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"Well my maker
Must've been a hard heartbreaker
And I'll tell you why
Said my maker
Must've been a hard heartbreaker (until you)
I'll tell you why

I'm breaking my own heart
Tryin' to love a faker

I tell your soul, hmm
Just like a blind, blind man
My little house is on fire
Hmm
Just like a blind man
My little house is on fire

I'm burning my own eyes out
Tryin' to reach the door

Well the sun is shining (well the sun it was shining)
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart (hmm my heart is cold, it is)
Well the sun is shining (well the sun is shining)
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart (reach my heart)
But I was cold

I'm wasting my whole life
Tryin' to make a new start

To make a new start
Hmm,
Gonna make a new start
Gonna make a new start
Gonna make a new start
Make a new start",Heartbreaker,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"I hold out hope
But it stalls
Soon, the last curtain falls
A hundred years of past has spoken

All the great warriors
Are sown into history's flag
Like a book of the seven seals
Of the hero's past
Through fires, revolutions
Dust storms and conclusions
Will the show go on tonight?
For one more time

I fight on,
Fight on,
I'm the last matador of Bayonne
For tomorrow this place falls
Into silence

There's a path
Traveled by many
Say one more prayer for my family
Like a ship without a sail
Cast adrift

I fight on,
Fight on
I'm the last matador of Bayonne
A hundred years of past
Now are gone",The Last Matador of Bayonne,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"Do you know what it means to walk alone?
And what it means to be, be by yourself?
Do you know what it means when there's no one to bring you good news?
Then you know, you know the meaning of the blues

Do you know what it means to cry alone?
And what it means to cry by yourself?
Do you know what it means to love a woman you can't own?
If you do, then you know the meaning of the blues

I've been weeping and weeping,
Moaning and moaning,
Crying and sighing all the day
I've been hiding my tears
Feel like dying
Wishing love would come to stay
And do you know what it means when the lord is taken away?
I cry, oh I cry
Oh I cry everyday

Yes I know what it means to walk alone
And how it feels to walk by myself
Yes I know what it means to love a woman you can?t own
Yes I do,
I know the meaning of the blues
Yes I know the meaning of the blues
Woo-hoo",The Meaning of the Blues,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"Baby woke up nervous
She was sweating from the steam heat
She kicked off the covers
Fever burning bright, paranoia night
Five alarm alert repeats
This city never beats you
But it buries you so deep
'Cause there ain't no love,
Ain't no love on the street

Baby's breathing deeply
She's listening to her heart beat
She walks into the kitchen
Dishes in the sink
Doesn't even matter
Maybe read a magazine
And the colored girls go
Whoop-de-doop-de-doop-de-doop-
Doop-de-doop-de-doop
'Cause there ain't no love,
Ain't no love on the street

Baby needs a frame of reference
Some other place to go
An all night launderette
Light a cigarette
Jump an usherette
Babe's an all night diner
She's got a trucker's appetite
'Cause there ain't ain't no love,
Ain't no love on the street",No Love on the Street,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"There's a slow train coming
It's movin' on down the line
Steel wheels on iron rails
Tonight I'm fixin' to die
Woo, I hope you don't mind pretty mama
Woo-hoo, hope you don't mind if I go

'Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I ain't gonna see you anymore

There's a slow train coming
Coming right on time
Smokestacks and bottle lightning
This jumper on the line
Woo, I can't do without it anymore pretty mama
Yes, I can't do it without it anymore

'Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I ain't gonna see you anymore

There's a slow train coming
To march us home from war
With my leather boots and my haversack
Sure can take it no more
Woo, I cried for her baby when I saw you there
Woo-hoo, I cried for her just the same

'Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I'm gonna cry for you just the same

Well there's a slow train coming
Carrying the mighty worker hordes
Eighteen days in the cotton field
Enough to put a man out of ?
Woo, It's time to move on pretty mama
Woo-hoo, Yes it's time to move on as I go

As the steam from my slow train rises
It's time for me to get on board",Slow Train,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"Mayday, man over board
I've fallen in love with you
Baby, won't you save me?
'Cause without you I just won't pull through

Sweet Rowena, won't you call my number?
Sweet Rowena, won't you call my name?
Throw me a line, I'm going under
And my heart is going up in flames

SOS, I'm in distress
Drown in a pool of tears
Angel, tell me how you feel?
Spending your time up in here

Sweet Rowena, won't you dial my number?
Sweet Rowena, won't you call my name?
Throw me a line, I'm going under
And my heart is going up in flames

911 no need to come
Just cancel my emergency (oh my emergency baby)
The sweetest thing, Lord, I've ever seen
Is snuggled right here next to me

Sweet Rowena, she dialed my number
Sweet Rowena, she called my name
Pull back the covers, I'm going under (going under baby)
And my house is going up in flames (up in flames)
Sweet Rowena, she dialed my number (call my number baby)
Sweet Rowena, she called my name
Pull back the covers, I?m going under (going under now)
Lord the house is going up in flames (oh in flames yes)
Oh yes it is baby",Sweet Rowena,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"I woke up in a hotel, didn't know what to do
I turned the TV on, wrote a letter to you
The news was talkin' 'bout a dead man upon the interstate
Seems they lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

Well since I left California baby, things have gotten worse
Seems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse
Tell that judge in Bakersfield, my trial I'll have to wait
They're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

It was somewhere in Nevada, it was cold outside
She was shiverin' in the dark, so I offered her a ride
Three bank jobs later, four cars hotwired
We crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire, Yeah!

Yeah If they'd known what we was up to they wouldn't let us in
Now we landed in Memphis like original sin
Elvis Presley Boulevard to the Graceland gates
Oh, see we're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates

Man, there must have been a dozen of them parked in that garage
There wasn't one Lincoln and there wasn't one Dodge
Wasn't one Japanese model or make
Just pretty, pretty Cadillacs' with Tennessee plates

She saw him singing once when she was seventeen
And ever since that day she's been living in between
I was never king of nothin' but that wild weekend
Anyway he wouldn't care, hell he gave them to his friends

This ain't no hotel I'm writin' you from
The Tennessee prison up at Brushy Mountain
Where yours sincerely's doin' five to eight
Stampin' out my time makin' Tennessee plates",Tennessee Plates,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"Well the sun is up and rising
The wagon's headed west
Now I can't shake that old suspicion
That I settled for second best
I've been frugal at my table
I've been conscious, I've been blind
Who ever said that 40 acres and a mule
Would ever keep me satisfied?

They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
Now (Out?) in the deep blue
Sometimes I get that feeling
That same ol' whale swallowed me

They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
To put me through the test
Sometimes I get that feeling
That I'm different from the rest

Now the sons of tomorrow
Will come to me in time
Life is going by so fast now, baby
I haven't had a chance to change my mind
I feel it in my fingers,
I can feel it in my bones,
Maybe it's the whale's way of telling me
It's time to get yourself back home

They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
Now in the deep blue
Sometimes I get that feeling
That ol' whale swallowed me

They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
To put me through the test
Sometimes I get that feeling
That I'm different from the rest

They say the whale that swallowed Jonah

Joe Bonamassa,"You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you

Well you steal my heart, and you go away
Don't tell me you'll see me another day
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you

Well I give you all my love
All my things too
Fine Cadillac baby watcha gonna do?
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you

Well people are talkin',
All over town
You say you're gonna love me but you put me down

You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you",You Better Watch Yourself,2011
Joe Bonamassa,"The radio is busted, down around my place
Every tool is rusted, down around my place
Creeks and rivers dried up, down around my place
My woman's tears are cried up, down around my place

And before there came a flood
Some lost all, even blood
Now the sun and wind have come and left no trace
Down around my place
Down around my place

These hunting grounds were hallowed, down around my place
Exhausted fields lay fallow, down around my place
Kingdoms come and crumble, down around my place
My prayers are merely mumbles, down around my place

And I put my faith in you
Did you make that error too?
Bound to fail that he might show his grace
Down around my place

Down around my place
Down around my place

They said you wouldn't believe
What a paradise this was
'Til every Adam and Eve, Tom, Dick and Harry
Started fighting for what he loved

So, we fortified the ramparts
And we built the mighty towers
But it was plain to see, we never were free
From the tyranny of the hour

The family graves keep winkin', down around my place
At every thought I'm thinkin', down around my place
While the young ones crowd the table, down around my place
Bitchin' about no cable, down around my place

And my grandpa says, “Don't worry
It's always the last one in who's in a hurry
To try and slam the door in the next one's face”
Down around my place
Down around my place
Down around my place
Down around my place
Down around my place",Down Around My Place,2012
Joe Bonamassa,"It's the darkest hour of the darkest night
It's a million miles from the morning light
Can't get no sleep, don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
When the shadows fall, I feel the night closing in
There must be some reason for this mood I'm getting in
Can't get no sleep, don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away
Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away
It's the darkest hour of the darkest night
It's a million miles to the morning light
Can't get no sleep, don't know what to do

Joe Bonamassa,"Look upon a mountain
Waitin' on a train
Baby I know what's wrong
And it still happened again
Waiting on my destiny
Learning from my abilities
Who was wrong and
Who was right and
Do we even know why we are fighting?
So take your eyes off of me
And look upon the churning sea

Driving towards the daylight
Running from the midnight
Trying to get my way home
Running from the spotlight
Trying to find the daylight
Trying to get back home

Rusty strings on my old guitar
Speaks volumes of who you are
So never did I think it was you
It was me, one of the chosen few
Who will it be, oh the next time?
Hopefully one with more sense of mind
So where did you go?
Always will see
It's a story of you and me

Driving towards the daylight
Running from the midnight
Trying to get my way home
Running from the spotlight

You can walk along a crowded street
But the city really ain't no bigger than the friendly people

In your fight, just stay strong
In the ill-fated wind, just go

Sometimes a man believes he's destined to go at this life alone

Others say he cried, he never found his place

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Joe Bonner,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.

Joe Bourne,"Music is a world within itself 
With a language we all understand 
With an equal opportunity 
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands 
But just because a record has a groove 
Don't make it in the groove 
But you can tell right away at letter A 
When the people start to move 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
Music knows it is and always will 
Be one of the things that life just won't quit 
But here are some of music's pioneers 
That time will not allow us to forget 
For there's Basie, Miller, Sachmo 
And the king of all Sir Duke 
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out 
There's no way the band can lose 
You can feel it all over 
You can feel it all over people

Missing you

You had to set me free

That our love is dying

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight

The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do

Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

A short goodbye, some photographs
I took them with me on the plane from Appledoore into LA

Still wear these memories on my shirt
From five days of summer in the rain

But you don't learn to fly, if you're not prepared to crash

She's the sunlight in my eyes
She's a bittersweet goodbye
And I just can't tell you why
I'd let her break my heart again
For those five days of summer in the rain, in the rain

I wrote a song I'd never sing
About a queen who lost her crown
About a boy who almost drowned
These angel city lights are mine
I wont forget but leave behind

She's a bittersweet goodbye
And I just can't tell you why

Joe Brown,"The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Lost on the sea

[Chorus]
The sea of heartbreak,
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress,
So divine,
I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I'm on a sea of tears...
A sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you
Where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail

Oh, what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
So come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from this sea

Joe Brown & the Bruvvers,"How many times have you heard someone say 
""If I had his money, I could do things my way?"" 
Little they know that it's so hard to find 
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind. 

Once I was winning in fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game 
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind 

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old 
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold 
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times 
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind 

When my life is ended, my time has run out 
My trials and my loved ones, I'll leave them no doubt 
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind ",A Satisfied Mind,

Joe Brown & the Bruvvers,"In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like jewels on the crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful picture of you

On a Streetcar, or in the cafÃ©
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you

It was last summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An' I took a little picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you,
I'm left with a picture of, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you",A Picture of You,1994

It only acts what you show

Showing signs of depression
Life's falling over and crashing
Your heart burns through life lava
And rapes your problem solver, now go

'Cause you don't want your heart tied up

But I can feel the proof when you're holdin' me
Like to let you think you're controllin' me
Even thought that ain't the deal
When I want I take the wheel, and I know

Can't hide that you're really into me
Hold is so tight I can barely breathe
'Cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel

Now go get the party jumpin' like me
Who crunk it like me
Lotta of guys here but none is like me

Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight
See 'em, done tonight, leave

Like one eyed peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these
And he's no longer playin'
But neither am I, so

What I'm sayin' is hop in the deuce seater with I
'Cause you know with them boots and that beater you fly
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie, won't drop a few pennies
Or cop you a guinea, but I'll cop you as many

Toast till the bottle's all empty
Like pardon the Bravado in me
Us two that's a plan somehow
Get to know each other later, let's dance for now, c'mon

Whatever you need that's me

Joe Budden,"Joey!
Let's go back in the days before your present
Back when it was a little more pleasent
Before I knew this rap shit would ever lure me in
Let's go back like Mike Fox in the Delorean
Back in the day shit, back to the basics
When brass knuckles used to leave a nigga face ticked
Its back to the Diadoras and the Asics
It's back to the New Editon and The Take 6

I'm number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

Let's go way back if you able to do the math yeah
I'm talkin' bout the pool table in the cafe yeah
When the strip was introduce to Paruiqo
Commodore 64 and Coleco
Not back to Cali back to the valley
Back to dapadere yall back to Bally's
Back before Puma and Stange'
Before Zhane and go a little further back to Kwame
Damn we came a long way

I'm number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

I remeber break dancin' cardboards and backflips
The royal blue and the orange Patricks
Wudn't like you homo sucka's
I had the low top Converse 'cause I could change my logos color
I remember way back when every clan was stylin'
Flava Flav clocks and X-Clan medallions
In class see a girl you glance at her
Pass her a note do you like me? Circle a answer

I'm number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

Winters not the best time warm it up Kane had came through
The eight ball jackets and Columbia Rain suits
We ain't pay minds to the length of our chains
Transformers was a dance Decepticons was a gang
Yall I'm talkin bout sheep skins
Talkin' bout wearn two pair of jeans when moms gave me a beatin'
After school three o clock we was able to fight
Park dibs y'all two turn tables and mike like

I'm number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

What about when Public Enemy came out and they dropped a classic
Or the Pee-Wee Herman and the Roger Rabbit
And the nerds took our tests and they passed 'em for us
Back to the roof top back to latin quarters
The olds school's new school now it's the same ol
It's back to Fila's, gazelles and Kango's
It's back to 40 ounces back to OE
Not back to rope chains but back to Gold teeth
I was the class clown just snappin at cats
Let's go back to the (?) with the matchin' hats
Remember the Real Roxanne remember all (?)
Remember Kool Moe Dee remember Lord Finesse
I bumped Run-D.M.C. almost every weekend
The Bronx and Queensbridge just couldn't stop beefin'
Kept it on wax they ain't have to pack heat
Back to Ron Zee tapes back to Black Sheep

I'm number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

Come on say it with me
I'm talkin' old Bobby Brown before he (?) Whitney
I used bring all my touys in the tub with me
A snotty nose kid eatin boogers
It was Ultimate Warrior and Jimmy Fly Snooka on
Sometimes I read scriptures like Psalms maybe
And I didn't wanna go to church but my moms made me
TV made me laugh
I remember Knight Rider 'cause Kit used to save his ass
Let's go back to spoonin' back to Black Moon and
Back to when wrestlin' had it's own cartoon and
They used to sleep on us now they demand us
Will smith told parents they just can't understand us
Back to playin the dozens
Back to humpin' our prettiest girl cousin
Psyche! I'm buggin.
NWA was simply known
Let' get back on the block I'm talkin Quincy Jones
I gotta Jones y'all

I'm number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

Let's go back before I burned the booth
When Tevin Campbell was ill before the whole world learned the truth
Hip hop had a message then dudes was droppin
I never got what I wanted on back to school shoppin'
Think about, used to be about shit
That was back when I still got easter outfits
We all grew up all older folks
Its more than just music its a culture folks

We number one, one, one, one
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say its number one

Remember sugar water
What was the name of the fuckin' drink
That they said the fuckin triple K
The Klu Klux Klan and shit had put some shit in and
The black niggaz were gon' die - huh?
Whatever that was, you niggaz knew about it",No. 1,2003
Joe Budden,"Mami, dude you love dick, caress and rub dick
Love street niggas, love a thug dick
But you don't look like you gettin' enough dick
But do you fuck in public and suck dick
Are you down with a dick, clown niggas dicks
When they put it in do you drown niggas dicks
Profound a nigga dick, and when you go down
I hope you don't kiss all around a nigga dick
You 'lame dick, all the same dick
Clowns who can't fuck, new to the game dick
Scared of a freak with a hall of fame dick
So keep fuckin' your ex-man who can't quit
You need stronger dick, fuck seven inches
Get a longer dick, put it on the dick
A champion dick, a heavyweight dick
Have you 2-way a nigga every day dick

[Chorus]
My Cris' and Mo' bitches, that ride it well
My strip show bitches, hope you ride it well
We can fuck in the house or in the car
But tell me can you ride dick like a porno star
My gin and juice bitches, that take it well
My in school bitches, cause you takin' it well
We can fuck in the house or in the car
But tell me can you take dick like a porno star

[Joe Budden]
A nigga need pussy, soft and sweet pussy
If your shit's tight, then I'll probably eat pussy
I'm a picky dude, don't need beat pussy
Strictly freak pussy, just to leak pussy
I need fine pussy, need dime pussy
Need rare pussy that hard to find pussy
Got a one-shot, I need all the time pussy
Up echelon, top of the line pussy
Need tight pussy, get right pussy
No sleep, break day, all night pussy
Fuck whack pussy, I'm lookin' for that pussy
Bitch you cheated on me but I'm right back pussy
Pop lock pussy, stop drop pussy
Let me lay up when the block hot pussy
Never before pussy, straight raw pussy
Fucked ten times but I want more pussy

[Chorus]

Look I love sex, kind of rough sex
Whip cream, honey out, handcuff sex
Never without sex, all about sex
Hard back shots, pillow in her mouth sex
Deep stroke sex, deep throat sex
Run around here like you don't need no sex
All day sex, it's foreplay sex
Your back on the wall in the hallway sex
Make me wait sex, third date sex
Just finished arguin, havin' hate sex
Relaxed sex, missionary sex
Nails in my back sex, now that's sex
No hands sex, advanced sex
Why you come to my crib wearin' pants sex
Unlikely sex, try me sex
You gon' fuck around and be wifey sex",Porno Star [*],2003
Joe Budden,"[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
I hate why'all duuuuuuudes
That get real life and rap confuuuuuuused
Don't get it fucked up, and don't get shoooot
Tryin to be somethin you're nooooot
My niggaz want war, whatchu think you good for?

Yeah you talk like them threats is real
A pine box, closed casket and mommy's black dress is real
I only spit what I live, and I play my part, feds know
You just talkin burners cause your A&R said so
Don't play the game like it's just a scrimmage
Don't think that what you hearrrin is just a image
How your songs though? You never spent a day in the bing
Niggaz is movin they mouths but they ain't sayin a thing
Half why'all vets is heartless and rep regardless
Only time you seen a courtroom was pressin charges
How you baggin up white, but won't scrap in a fight
Sheeeeit, see'mon mayne, shit ain't addin up right
When shit's thick, whatchu gon' do with that pound
But real recognize real, you must be new in this town
All I'm hearin is another nigga's life over tracks
And you lames ain't willin to lose your life over rap

[Chorus]

Tired of hearin' 'bout you rap dudes comin' with the guns
Never caught a body, had the smell comin from the trunk
(And umm) I'm tired of hearin 'bout your four's bust
While I was cuffed on a up North bus
Why'all fucked on a tour bus
All them stories 'bout you gettin' money with gangsters
(Guess what?) The shit is pretty funny to gangsters
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout that gat in your boot
'Cause when it's said and done
And you finished that rap in the booth, it's back to the truth
And your shit is glass thug (and you) never outside
'Cause youse a in the lab thug (youse a) pen and pad thug
It sounds good, you ain't pushin work in the projects
But you spittin' 'bout it when you work on your project
Clown answer back, why'all never seen the hammers flash
Just photo shoots when cameras flash
All I'm hearin is another nigga's life over tracks
And you lames ain't willin to lose your life over rap

[Chorus]

In direct beef between rappers, they be all thugs
See each other in the street and dap, it's all love
War stories ain't yours about the pounds your man got
Only time you move bricks is when the SoundScan drop
You ain't never cooked nothin' by that kitchen sink
And the only time you been behind bars was fixin' a drink
You actin a fool, got real life and rap confused
With them ten o'clock songs, you just rappin' the news
But I ain't mad atcha flow, he tryin to stack his dough
But everybody's a thug until them ratchets show
The same dudes that rap about (they get) stuck for all the 1's
And if everybody's a killer, where the fuck is all the punks?
I hope you gettin your loot; just remember
What you spit in the booth
There's other people that's livin' proof
Why'all cats with all the mouth, just stay in your lane
And pray that a real NUCCA don't decide to call you out

[Chorus]",Real Life in Rap [*],2003
Joe Budden,"See what I'ma do is, like...
I just kinda want to be able to, you know...
Smoke by myself,
Without kinda being bothered by what a motherfucker had to ?
Without really havin' to do nothin'
So I'ma go buy this pack, of 100's,
Take me about 10 minutes to smoke a whole 100
Yeah, I'ma snip one upside down
And I'ma take one out and I'ma light it...

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace

Look, now 'is a couple dudes that don't want to see me poppin'
They sarcastically ask me 'when your CD's droppin'
Gotta keep my game face
They don't leave me no options
Can't lose my cool I know the streets keep watchin'
Dudes want to see me lose it all
But I ain't come this far to fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
And I ain't gotta walk around with my clip and nine
A real nigga just open his coat to me and said his is mine
He said call him with his problems
But he don't know that there's always problems, it only gets worse
Like, some dudes get threatened they can't stop me
So all they do is threaten to pop me
But go and get your weapon and cock, G
See it's real here, I dun been up and down the block all week and I'm still here
Look, you want to know where the booze and coke at
Gangsta's, gorillas, damoo's and locs at,
Where the bricks, where the dick, where the X, where the morphene be,
Take the turnpike to 14B
But now it's back to this pussy dude threatenin' to hurt me
I didn't know all of this came with reppin' Jersey
But now it's no secret
If the thought of jump off doin it makes you so heated nigga so be it
But certain beef will be handeled if you're special
Only marble in the crib, is the handle on his special
My guns in the hood
I can't run from the hood
Nigga my sons in the hood
That should tell you what's what
Soon as I feel good you retards remind me
But son, it ain't hard to find me
I'm at ringside any time the fights on
And I'm in the big black truck with the carolina lights on
Or you can hop on the Pulaski Skyway
I'm in the strip club almost every Friday
Kats is cornballs
y'all dudes is bitches
Like I ain't got enough problems with this music business

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace

Some days I don't want to be bothered
Some days I just miss my father (damn)
Some days I just miss my father
Some days I want to relapse on redline
'cause he'll be gone for 26 months fed time
I try to maintain through all this
And pray to god pop keep the same clean date and 4 dicks
My pockets flat kid
You do the math on $5.15 an hour full time after taxes
That wasn't good enough to keep my MO
Shit that wasn't good enough to complete my demo, for real
Some days I don't want to be seen
And some days I don't shower, I don't want to be clean
Look, sometimes the truth could hurt you
So I blow my cig smoke right at the Truth commercial
Some days I don't want to be bothered
Some days I just miss my father
And even if by a miracle he makes it half way out
It won't be parole y'all, it be the half way house but NAH
That's not the right path for a Budden
'cause we're addicts, addicts can't do half of nothin'
Some days I'm reachin for the thing in the dresser
Some days I'm not invincible and I feel the pressure
Like if everyone's dependin on me, and I just stop
...
Then what the fuck happens?
I can't take that route and girl out
And sometimes I don't want to hear my girls mouth 'cause
My hectic schedule, she ain't considerate
So all I hear is the complaints and bickerin
Radio's, studio's, photo shoot's
She think I'm fuckin every girl that say I'm oh so cute, cute
Don't appreciate a man and you lose him
Worst thing to do to an innocent man is accuse him
And I ain't with beefin' with home's
Bran Nubian style, I had to love ma' but leave her alone
It ain't workin out, I'll see you aight
Just let go and let God see if we reunite
'cause with yo shit added to the dudes that want to see me fall
Nah, fuck it I won't fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall, fall
But listen, I'm fucked up now
Don't ask why y'all
Sometimes the best medicine is just to cry y'all
Know what I'm sayin?
Excuse my voice fans, that should be a sign that I identify with what I'm sayin
'cause it's these type of thoughts that'll kill ya
If you smokin' with me right now, then you a good way from the filter
And I won't front like I ain't stressin'
Sometimes I need a hug, real shit, pain shit is pain lesson (nigga)

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace

Give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace

Give me 10 minutes
By myself, you the boys at home
That's all the time I really need to enjoy my bone
If you sparked when the song was beginnin at that time
Then your stoge should be endin with mine
And to you know who...
Ma, I never saw me being with you
But sometimes y'all dreams come true
I'm like your number one fan
Damn, I ain't think Joe would see you
You's a fantasy
I wasn't supposed to meet you, NAH
Chances of that were so unlikely
And if we did meet, you wasn't supposed to like me
But look, I rap now and it just so happens
God put me in a spot where that was just so happenin, see
She had a man, I had a girl
I broke up with mine and around that same time
We was hangin out she never laid a hand on me
But I could tell from the way she glanced at me
Her looks said baby boy somethin hampers me
And it would go down but I got my man with me
Lord how can it be?
You know I never been the dude to come and break up a happy family
And these 2 looked so happy on the outside
They could've only been happy on the outside
We eventually started creepin'
But for me it's just sex
For her it's cheatin'
It went down, one time, two times, once more
Talkin real passionate, every time it jumped off
I'm in deep y'all she's more than a jump off
We both catchin' feelins, both startin to want more
But guess what, she can't leave him
Maybe it's somethin' I don't know about, maybe she needs him
Means I still gotta front like we ain't sleepin'
Still gotta shake his hand, I still gotta see him
How's he supposed to look, supposed to feel for me
He gotta know I'm feelin you, and you feelin me
How am I supposed to look at that man with respect
With Bleek singin 'Is That Your Chick In My Head'
Dru Hill - 'Somebody Sleepin In My Bed'
Aaliyah - 'If Your Girl Only Knew' reversed, but look
Here's why I'm down and out
I'm kinda worried y'all
I ain't heard from him much since he found out
??? it wasn't mine y'all, she's still in the brain
And I know wherever she's at, she's feelin' the same
So 'till my fantasy dame pop up
Everytime the cell rings I'm prayin that her name pop up, for real
I know y'all, I ain't supposed to wife her
But it's God's fault, I wasn't supposed to like her
Sometimes I think, why'd I have to meet chick for?
And some times dog, be careful what you wish for
Some times I don't want to be bothered
Some days I just miss my father
He's stuck in the system
Treated like a dude that's heartless
And they just transferred him, brought him up on new charges
Yeah folks i'm back to that
So I light another one and smoke back to back for real
I'm chain smokin' if you ain't on my page, listen
I'm stressed out, hopin' this one'll taste different
Dudes hopin' that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes wishin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall

Nah, I won't fall
Hopin that I lose it all
I won't fall, nigga (nah)
Hopin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Nah
Nah, (aint come this)
Some days I don't want to be bothered
Some days I just miss my father (damn)

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull

Calm down... calm down...
Baby just calm down...
(Calm down...)
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
Baby just calm down...
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(She would pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
Calm down...

[Joe Budden]
Look, I was such a lost soul, just wanted to be down with something
Look at your son now mommy I amounted to something
You couldn't figure out, what I had messed with the streets for
Cause you saw my genius without a SAT score
I took drugs and laced it with things
But you a addict yourself,
For you I was people places and things (how the fuck you thought)
Angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
I tried to hide it, but Visine didn't always work
I needed someone to blame in my mind
I thought if you and dad never used dope I would a came out fine
And so I igged you hard when you threw in advice
Like what I want to talk to you about you ruined my life
You the reason why I ended up a con and I knew it
The reason I filled my body with that bomin fluid, mommy
You the reason that my life's gone illegal
The reason I'm kinda different, don't think like normal people, not calm

[Chorus]
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(You got to understand what I was going through)
Baby just calm down...
Everything's gonna be alright
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(But a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all

[Joe Budden]
Listen... ain't shit like seeing your moms crying on the floor
Knowing you the reason why she ain't alright no more
But so young, I was like whatever
You use to chase me through the house with the knife like get your life together
Fucking drugs, how could I ever amp on you
And what made me think that I could lay my hands on you
I'm not surprised that you mad at me
Much as you hated my father, your youngest son is just like his daddy
Mommy I live life rude, how could you not understand it
On the same note I'm just like you
I got moms sensitivity, my fathers balls,
His humor, his g, yet my heart is yours
Fuck school, cause I had my major
Come to grips that it ain't so much the drugs, it's the addict behavior (no)
Wasn't the dip jar, it's the cut that came with it
Wasn't really the smoking, but the rush that came with it (wasn't calm people)

[Chorus]
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Calm down...
(but a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
(do it with me people) Calm down...
Calm down...
(try to understand it) Baby just calm down...
(those kind of things) Everything's gonna be alright
Calm down...  (just bare with me for a... for a brief moment y'all)
Calm down...
Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all

[Joe Budden]
I felt so alone, I had a crew, but so what
Then when Angela stabbed me guess who showed up
And when people said I?d always be ill and twisted
And when the therapist had told us that the pills would fix it
Was sick of being sick, I was finally hurt
With all the praying that you did ma, it finally worked
God gave you a son back, I won't offend you again
Won't let the disease turn me against you again
Use to be high as ever, (but I) Joey Jr. got his life together
As a result, now we tighter than ever
So blessed, so grateful to be seeing tomorrow (see the whole world)
That's why I can't take a drink, not if even a swallow
I can't picture me twisted, like what I'm a do now
Haters I can't stop yet, my mothers to proud
Secure now, don't need to be down with nothing
Look at your son now mommy, I amounted to something
I'm so calm

[Chorus]
Calm down...
Calm down...
(but a nigga wouldn't calm down) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all (hold up)
She use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) calm down...
(But I couldn't, I couldn't, couldn't do it) Baby just calm down...
(Nothing heals like time people) Everything's gonna be alright
(Understand that) calm down...
Calm down...
(Fucking miracle) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
(They said I wouldn't reach 21 y'all... I'm still standing)

Calm down...
Thanks ma...
Calm down...
I couldn't do it without you

Whether it's from all of us
You best believe Busta rhymes more flavor than all the rest
From all the mess, hardcoreness from all the stress
Gotsta get this flawless flow from off my chest
Whose impossible folding impossible flow
Ain't a thing in the world that ain't culpable so so
I make you anticipate great
Type shape real live niggas appreciate
To the utmost I pack toast, keep the gat closed
Run niggas to the island I pack most
After the gun burst quench my blood thirst
We will be leavin' you much worse so one hearse
Yo, now we embellish fuck the jealous
And they mark on niggas now what you gon' tell us
Skydiver, short circuit just like a live wire
And give it the niggas because we got the fire!

All my people in the place 
Just put your hands up in the air
And while we blow the spot and keep it hot
You got that fire!
Jump, shake, bounce when we come to you turn you out
It's Flipmode Squad that keeps on right your rightest place
We got that fire!

Hey yo
Rock until I'm gone
Till the party's over and he start turnin' the lights on
Type of shit, right inside your whole crew be on
Be the bullshit, so keep movin' on
No I ain't havin' it
Why you grabbin' it, my flow is immaculate
Passionate when it comes to the fire that you have to get
Then I tackle it and kill like we Jackal and Jaffolit
Rob niggas and give it to the church so they can raffle it
Now you can distinguish how
Afro-English flowin' broke in English
Witness how we stay hot and how we keep us goslin'
Women flawsin' blow the spot often
(WHAT) niggas say (what) you need to calculate
Re-evaluate the shit off so we retaliate
Marinate, when I give the hustle and carry weight
And bust up niggas like you would have the Bleat Estate
It's the niggas like y'all I hits for only when it counts
Black on the set and make motherfuckers bounce
Connected the raw types of shit
To make your bitch bug and make niggas pull out cake
Hey I think it's whack yo, I stack dough, and pack a rap show
And then let all of my niggas in the back door
And let the spot short circuit just like a live wire
And give it the niggas because we got the fire!

Just put your hands up in the air
And while we blow the spot and keep it hot

Hold up nigga, slow up nigga
Don't start a war unless your dough's up, nigga
Know what nigga? Joe's up nigga
y'all shouldn't cry about it, grow up nigga
Guess what y'all?  I know magic
I could make your pulse disappear and no hat trick
Death threats - it ain't phase me
When I bring the T-Mac through the Rucker y'all, it ain't Tracy
Sewed up nigga, low cut nigga
So keep talin bout your wrists froze up nigga
You might see 30 whips roll up nigga
We be at the pawn shop givin your Rol' up nigga
Just wanted to make that known, you seen _New Jersey Drive_
Round here, leave that Maybach home

You'll find out the hard way if your On*Star works, cause

I don't, need a reason to bust my guns
So don't, give me reason to bust my guns
You might, be the reason I bust my gun

'Til my day's up nigga, stay up nigga
Play Tony Montana, get your face cut nigga
That goes out to all of you play thug niggaz
How you want it, long nose or the trey snub nigga?
Return and die dog, if I start clappin in your crib
Nah I ain't tryin to turn the lights off
Trapped on the chain, got the jewels and cape
Be like Jared, Subways made him lose his weight, but look
I'm bout gettin money for all races
Only oldie but goodie I know is small faces
Wait, make you sure you heard right; woulda been put the hit out
But I ain't tryin to get my third strike
Lace up nigga, say what nigga?
Your Maybelline raps that you make-up nigga
Wake up nigga, stakes up nigga
For all my locked-down and my cased-up niggaz, cause

Who's that nigga?  New cat nigga
Don't disrespect, don't do that nigga
Hate to hear the sound of the tool clap nigga
Dual strap nigga when I do black niggaz
First hand with a three-eighty kickback
Brains on your lap dog, babysit that
Look, it's my turf, get up off the stoop now

Street love nigga, G's up nigga
You lookin for a loan on your re-up nigga
Haters might want to put hollows in ya
When you're young black spendin like a lotto winner why'know

I'm comin, I'm comin, I'm comin

[Joe - talking over background vocals]
Okay... the time has finally come beautiful people
Jeah... I've been singin this tune for entirely too long now
For like, eight or nine years, somethin like that
But I'm here, only to present to you your album
Featurin myself, Joe Budden, hi haters

[Joe Budden]
The time is finally near, it's gettin closer I'm finally scared
(?) that the album's out y'all, it's finally here
I repeat myself for the haters y'all, I'm finally here
Every street corner, jail cell, finally cheer
Cause it was y'all that voted me, y'all that noticed me
It's y'all that said I should've been signed to Def Poetry
It was y'all that said yes y'all can flow a tree
Momma raised me proper, the streets just molded me
The streets coded me, made me a better pedigree
Now things are complicated like Avril Lavigne said it be
But I took some time out to get my shit straight
And present to you, jump off seventy minute mixtape
This here's for real, this here's the official
This year it's not a ""Best Of,"" this is the best of
How can I say this? It's sorta like - Hov', 'Pac, B.I.G.
Blended with Bill Withers and Miles Davis
Let's add Al Green, folks I miscalculated
Now it's Ludacris time, ""Move - get out my way bitch!""
A rapper's rapper, the kid can do this
To you ignorant muh'fuckers, don't misconstrue this
Everything reversed now, I live in _The Matrix_
So how can I stay anonymous, when it's my job to be famous? (Talk to 'em)
A lot of y'all can't interpret when I'm speakin that language
But some better understand to the rest it's better you can't
Now when you speak of the elite, I feel honored if mentioned
Because the goal is on top, never honorable mention
If Joe's purpose is due, here it is it's no further anew
Enough said with no further adieu

Joe Budden,"112! (Jump off!)
Aww yeah (Uhh, why'know)

You want to get right, boo, headlights, blue
Don't no other mami give me head like you
I get you in the club, sit right in the Rover
Why now you ain't gotta pretend like you like the promoter
We could lamp in the five with my hand on yo' thigh
You goin' to sleep thinkin' that this can't be life
Don't mistake my talkin' modest
Still put you in the wi-ld bedroom with the walk-in closet
Bay, riverboats, if you want to see water
Full length minks, get rid of that three-quarter
Ex-man never had you feelin' that fly
Flat screens in the room with the ceiling that high
When them other cats call you, you can turn your phone off
New school your neck, take that herringbone off
Stretch 'Vee playin' Manhattan
System old school, play 'em and had 'em
We makin' it happen, oh yeah

[Chorus:]
Turn this off for a minute
We can do bigger things if you widdit
We can be me and you, I know you feel it
You can say, ""La la-la la, la la la la""
All you want, you can get it
You can have all my time, let's spend it
The way you do your thing, I can't forget it
Got me screamin', ""Ma ma-ma ma, ma ma ma ma""

Look, I need a wife too, feed her ice, blue
Got birds on the side, I don't treat 'em like you
I don't let 'em play with the wheel and when the check come
They already know they gotta pay for they meals
Say I'm, comin' at you with lines, think they lies
Just because I don't match your compatible sign
I'ma let the world see, other boos can't relate
Let you walk in front, make the other dudes hate
When I put it on you, you throw it right back (ha ha)
Who else you know gon' poke it like that?
And ma I'm gon' show you like that, you be hollerin'
""La la-la la, la la la la"" - oh yeah, look
Private party, it's just me, you
And the new envy of ours, we won't be sorry
Scoop it, we can do the all from Harley(?)
Why'all ask me hardly nah, I'm up to par

[Chorus:]

Look forget my miss, no let's remind miss
And I never let a clown disrespect my miss
I need dat in my life, a G might cry
But you the only one that ever get to see that side
Look, my lady fresh, we ain't gotta rush
We can take baby steps, that may be the best
Hate to repeat myself, I know I already told you
But mom's sayin' what's good I'm tryin' to know you
If you been for lookin' for the right one, well here he is
Ready to take things a little mo' serious
Ain't nervous no more, you heard it all before
Are you a Fifth Ave miss, but you workin' that velour?
Stop, I'm tired of trickin', I'm tired of pigeons
Need a house with acres to put my wife and kids in
Chefs are good when they gettin' right in the kitchen
Baby girl that's the life we'd be livin', understand somethin'

Baby let me be with you more, hold you more
Let me get the chance, I can show you more
Let me get to know you more, I'll be screamin' out
""La la-la la, la la la la""
If I could, wife you out, ride this out
You're the only one I wouldn't ride without
I could show you what this life's about
I be screamin' out, ""Ma ma-ma ma, ma ma ma ma""

[Chorus:] 

This is the type of shit right here, listen
You gotta go to the car wash on this one
Hehe, you can't ride around dirty and dusty and shit
If it just went yesterday, when you wake up
Take it to the car wash
Don't just get the exterior joint neither
We need the-the-the works, the thirty dollar joint
And we need to get the little tree to put up in the rear view
So it's smellin' nice and sexy like when they get inside

Man you got to be cool blood
Gotta feel you right here, niggaz down for whatever

[Joe Budden]
Everybody's so gangsta gangsta, tell me how you do it
Keep the façade that real when you not that real, that's real!
The strip is hot so I don't hear my foes beefin
That's tellin me that I bought all these burners for no reason
Come, get me thug I walk with a mini teeny tiny eeny weeny snub
And real niggaz give me love
Besides, don't make me feel like you threaten my life God (why?)
I go and cop somethin that only come with a Tripod
(And the) Old school is puff puff, pass the spark up
And white kids got high, off of magic marker
Back when 40s was liquor (but now) now shorties is bigger
They want to be down, y'all wannabe clowns, get a grip homes
Blastin the tool, you out of character dude
You not a felon or rider, you a fellow subscriber
Who is you tellin them lies to, don't push it to a limit
to mimic you benefiting to what, the gimmicks up, BLAH

[Chorus]
When shit get thick, clips start to spit (pusha man)
Push work wait wet and dipstick (pusha man)
You need product, I'ma be there, con of the year
Fuck givin my word, I solemnly swear
Swear to hold your fort - I solemnly swear
Keep a straight face in court - I said I solemnly swear
It's pusha man - incognito from the feds in the precinct
I solemnly swear to this game I pledge my allegiance

[Joe Budden]
Uhh.. it's killin me soft, jokers is actin like they really the boss
With a Milli Vanilli award cause they really a fraud
Milli's applaud if you ain't really my dawg
I crack Phillies with broads but now I'm sober they don't feel me no more
And G.P.s and V.I.P.s
I be O-T in D.C. with O-Zs so my time's up like O.C.
Uhh, when I hustle they thought that I went soft
Cause y'all jerked them for the price, I took twenty percent off
I don't drive I like shotguns, never pulled L's
I like shotguns, hate .22's I like shotguns
Non-descrip's talkin bout they got guns
Like tecs 4-5s and shotguns, really they never shot guns
Go 'head act like a gangsta claim to clap like a gangsta
It's all good fellas, now he rap like a gangsta
Hate me or love me, dap me or slug me
Scream FUCK ME but when things get ugly I get gully

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Look, a cock nina should get me a hot beamer
Settin up shop in the suburbs, I'm gettin that white cream that Noxema
I'm good at duckin the cops subpoena
Cats is shook when alone but come tough when the cops are between us
Stash house was never empty, had the cracks on UP
Soprano came to see me, got barritoned UP
Had clientele crazy, every borough I hustled
Remember back in the day when you had to be thorough to hustle?
Cats hustle to feed they kin
Now every combo with a package to try to pitch for some sneakers and Timbs
Shit back in the day, niggaz looked at jail like school
Now new jacks is spittin bout jail like it's cool (dawg)
That ain't gangsta, I don't believe that, you don't believe it yourself
Gangsta's real, gangsta speaks for itself
A lot of gangstas is lifers and they gone right now
So fag cats is screamin gangsta, something's wrong right now

Let me talk to 'em
First off, all the questionin, I thought we was above that
We got some time and act like you wish to jerk that
C'mon don't tell me that we already endin
And fuck I need to cheat on you for, I'm already winnin
It's like (I want to know) if I got a exit them tensions
Callin her names, tryin to make her feel like less of a woman
But nah, picture I shady, WON'T lie and say I DON'T lie
Once or twice maybe, forever you my lady MY
You gorgeous but, it's more than just your hips that talk
It's good, but want more
It's how we laugh, you know shall we not
My better half slash your eyes the vibe we got, it's like
(I want to know) If I'm real in a deal
And then, she want to know if I feel how she feel
And real when I'm dealin, please believe boo
Won't deceive you - it's not just a want, I need you

It's like (I want to know) if I'm at some other broad's
Laughin in bed, she got it all mapped in her head
Ma, I'm all about, you and me
But you slowly losin me when you keep accusin me
I know why you be askin where I came from
Nothin wrong with arguin but we havin the same ones
Either you gon' ride out or you gon' spoil it
Either you gon' take a shit or get up off of the toilet
It's like (I want to know) if I be lyin to her
Or if I think these other birds finer than her, so
So when your man's on the road, he don't see you
I don't want the sex to be the only thing that keeps you
I give you my all, just holla at me if you want more
You tired of hearin 'bout me talkin 'bout a jump off
You my girl, my wiz, my life
Ma we can't go wrong ma, listen to the horns ma

It's like (I want to know) if my career catches fire
Out of all the woman in the world, why her?
Hold up now you gettin mad at yourself
Just take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
How many times I gotta tell ya, boo you all that I got
How many times I gotta tell ya, be secure in your spot
I understand so I can't knock it, but I'm your man stop it
Checkin my two-way, and goin through my pants pockets
It's no need, you my girl, my wiz, my life
Look ma you my heart, my all, my wife; and you pissed
'Cause you know other chicks would LOVE to smash your man

Uh-huh...
I just want everybody to kinda be clear..
Of what's takin place right now...
It's not an introduction, it's more like a beginning...
It's like the calm before the storm...
I guess you can sorta call it, the rebirth...
Or the birth period... it's the growth...
For all my real niggaz... real people in general...
It's never one-dimensional, it goes out to everybody...
If you can though... just kinda take some time out...
Relate to it

For all my mans that died, with grams at they side
Plans just to ride, gun jammed when he tried
Ballers who never made it out the hood
Cats who owed, but never made it out the hood
If they offered you pleas and you went to court with it
My dawgs doin time cause you got caught with it
Or if you need cheddar, blast heat whenever
And run from the cops cause you know the streets better
Dope niggaz who rich cause they know connects
Or dope niggaz who spit but got no connects
If you pitch to pay rent, but get no business
Life in the state pen but get no visits
Fend for yourself cause you ain't got no boys
Ride or die, really you ain't got no choice
If your alibi's straight when you're wanted on the stand
Soldiers that take they football numbers like a man
Hustle O-Z cause your product rich there
Hood know you snitch but you gotta live there
You held your man shot, you don't know where it hit him
And you tryin to buy guns, you don't know where to get 'em
If you strapped in the streets with your palms all black
Young G's that gotta see they moms on crack
Pop can't be found, hand me down
When you the oldest out of five, hold the family down
If you caught a body and your wiz hid you out
If you slept in the park when moms kicked you out
Or if you gonna die, you gon' leave with a slug
Idolized your big bro, but he was a thug
If you squeeze your leather first 'cause it never hurt
Street cats that never work cause it never worked
Or if you got your shit snatched, gripped, clipped the mack
Too small for the kickback, but gotta get your shit back
Killed niggaz playin, but you was only boxin
Accept twenty flat as your only option
Calm in the jungle in between the system
If you high on parole and gotta clean your system
If you told 'em to stop, cause soon you'll lose it
Pull up your pants leg, bullet wounds to prove it
Or if you grabbed the liquor, swallow it hard
If they drive-by on you but you follow the car
Full clip cause your foes is lurkin; or the D's at your door
with a picture, ""Do you know this person?""
If you dead broke, but forced into extortin
Cause your girl pregnant and she don't want a abortion
Got charged before, strap a gun anyway
Took the state's lawyer, but you won anyway
Stand up cats beat the odds by far
Real recognize real, R.R.R.

Don't mistake a amped up nucca.. for what?
For a stand up nucca.. I won't
If you a stand up nucca.. then what?
Then stand up nucca.. R.. R.. R..

Basically, that's about it...
Hope you people get a better understanding...
And roll with me... geah!
Let's get into it...",Stand Up Nucca,2003

Jump off Joe Buddens on top
This go out to all my niggas
You ain't gotta chain but you got a
Mean muthafuckin' wrist game
All my ladies you ain't got a car but you gotta
Mean muthafuckin' heel game
Click them heels you know how we do it c'mon c'mon
Woh woh okay dub
Woh have some fun with it

Mami I'm there if you fine in the rear
We can get into whatever if you don't mind boo be yeah
And when I'm done slidin' you somethin' fierce
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

I ain't got to tell homeboy he know that
This is 'Matrix Reloaded' and Neo's back
I'm up humble apologies sorry clowns
I'm here for the long run I ain't coffee brown

Get to know me the man the person
So by the time I'm on my fifth album
You should understand the first one
It's non-fiction you deny you want proof
I only buck in the air when the sky's in the booth

You gets liable to shoot
This twenty-two release some extra keyholes
On the driver's side of your coupe
Like nighty night here's your lullaby bitches
You might need just a lil' more than butterfly stitches

Get out of line and get stuck up duke
Lose your spines tryin' to touch us jukes
Get to the mall in a circle guns out playin' duck-duck goose
This shit is kinda aight till I fuck in the booth

I'm sayin' I'm here got my nine up in here
Thugs wanna rumble I don't mind nigga yeah
And when I'm done slidin' up somethin' fierce
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

Like I don't roll with niggas that'll lift ayn chrome
Take a look at 'em you can see they just skin and bones
Y'all talk about bricks when y'all know who move 'em
Us real niggas make withdrawls while y'all go through 'em

We carry long guns we can contra on it
We talk about it we live it y'all ponder on it
Shit ridiculously priced us cons afford it
I'm talkin' straight cash you might need a sponsor for it

But wait ever met somebody that wouldn't chill
Every second he feel the need to let you know that he's real
Every second he wanna talk about his homies that died
And the people he killed and in the future all the people he will

Talk about who he stabbed and beat up and he won't cool out
Yakety-yakkin' he's reminiscing on different shootouts
How he was there shotties was blastin' cops came with body bags
And he's talkin' but nobody asked him

Naw he want attention he want his name yelled
And me and him always end up in the same cell
I'm pissed on the top bunk I can't sleep this guy ain't street
Go 'head nigga I ain't beef but feel

Stop there who popped him where
Who you backed out on and had the whole block scared
Ma when I'm done pokin' you from the rear
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

Ma you real aggressive catchin' me of balance
It's a turn off don't you know niggas respect a challenge
Move a lil' slow gettin' at me
Treat the pussy like it's worth somethin'
Don't just go throwin' it at me 'coz

While you doin' it at the same time
I'm thinkin' how many niggas hit you wit that same line?
Or how many other niggas you ran game to?
How many niggas you fucked or you gave brain to?

How many other dudes houses you done came to?
With condoms on you hopin' that he find 'em on you
And I ain't tryin' to catch nothin' from you
So I'm caught up in a catch twenty-two

If I don't fuck her then I'm not like guys she met before
So while I'm turnin' her down she's just likin' me more
But if I do get to pokin' hit her with long strokin'
I now have a girlie on my hands that's open

I don't want her callin' me constantly
Thinkin' 'coz I fucked her she got a bond with me
I don't want her misunderstandin' a one night stand
It was just a nut I'm not your man

Ma I'm there if you fine in the rear
We can get into whatever if you don't mind boo be yeah
And when I'm done slidin' you somethin' fierce
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

Ma I'm there name a time and where
We can get into whatever if you don't mind boo be yeah
And when I'm done pokin' you from the rear
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

",U Ain't Gotta Go Home,2003
Joe Budden," 

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk with me...
I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me...
I need for all of y'all to feel what I'm going through
And see what I see, if you got time to take a walk with me
Wait a minute now...
Shit ain't like I thought it would be
Come to Jersey from New York with me
I know you busy...
But take the time out to walk with me
Pay attention on this tour with me
Maybe I'm seeing something wrong
Come along and make sure with me
Come and take a short walk with me

[Joe Budden - Verse 1]
Yo...I'm seeing a couple things wrong with the way that I'm living
So come and walk with me I just need a second opinion
Introduce you to my friends I got to see if you notice
If they loyal or if they all got an alterial motive
See some snake niggas, me and them don't deal anymore
Ever since I got signed I don't know what's real anymore
I'm paranoid so excuse me if I seem to be nervous
But everybody from my past now they trying to resurface
Trying to rekindle, They don't think I know they gone limo
I got cousins I never knew they trying to pass me a demo
Maybe I'm wrong, like I told you main I need your opinion
Me and him never spoke before so I don't see what's so different
Dudes I don't know they recognize me start extending they hand
And I'm trippin ready for beef when he was only a fan (why?)
Cause these niggas in my hood say they don't like how I'm reppin'
Let me know how strongly you feel, will I be needing my weapon
As some sort of protection, should I carry a pen and pad
And ask everybody in the fucking hood for they suggestion
I'm letting the labels know that Jersey City is gifted (dog)
When they didn't know that Jersey City existed, but it's cool dog
Certain cats in Jersey City so hateful (Hatefulll)
And certain cats in Jersey City ain't grateful (Ain't gratefulllll)
All they say is I don't chill anymore
Ever since I got signed they don't think I'm real anymore
I'm told I shouldn't be alone cause I'm a star in my hood
Something might happen mouse, they know who you are in the hood, they do
So I can't tell you how I feel anymore
Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore, you feelin' me dog

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden - Verse 2]
See to me it's heavy, but to you it may seem petty
Let's continue walking, I know you ain't tired already
I take you to meet my girl I got to see if you notice
If she love me or if the bitch got an alterial motive
Why am I hated cause I handle my business
Ain't got to look for a girl nowadays cause almost all these niggas is bitches
See 'em often while we walking I'll show you the drug dealers
and some dudes that hate me word on the streets is they real killers dog
Where was the hate back when I wasn't on my feet
An alcoholic, school dropout, just a bum on the street
Where was the hate during my adolescence
Back when that psychiatrist was trying hard to get me on I'm manic depression so man
I don't recall none of this happenin' back then
And I don't understand I was still rappin' back then
So I got to ride with a gun
From trying to get my mom and pop up out of the slums and provide for my son
If you met my baby moms would you notice
If she was ready for a child of if her ass had an alterial motive
I don't know what she's teaching Trey but everday he get older
Angie's bitter and feel like now that I'm successful I owe her
Cause she would hold me so tight when I was ready to relapse
Tell me to relax, I ain't know no better straight out of rehab
Bottom line I was lonesome
But we was wrong for each other, Angie I grown some
Got bigger issues, if you went to Def Jam would you notice
If they was out for my best interest or do they just see a dollar in Joseph?
(Ugh) Guess I ain't sure how I feel anymore
Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore
I mean them same record execs that wanted me in
Don't care that I'm the next nigga, they just want to see spins I swear
Guess I ain't sure how I feel anymore
Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore, you feelin' me dog

Don't get it twisted the gun is on me (now)
This chick's wit her man frontin' on me
I'll holla at her when she done wit homie
Cause, Jump Off I got a ton of grown freaks
One named Tasha, one named Monique
One's diva'd out, keep her make-up tight
She got her good heels on wit her Jacob ice
And ma love to club, so she stay up nice
And she give me brains just the way I like!
One's real ghetto, don't give a reason
She knows I'm not her man, she don't riff bout cheating
Joey only go to her crib on weekends
Real real late when the kids are sleeping
'Tis the season, no more BS music
Watch and learn, see us do this

And probably swell up your nose
Lotta bitches love when I spit so let me dazzle you hoes
Let me prazzle your head, do and skidattle wit Joe
And get a stack of that money and get a stack of the 'dro
Better back it up money before they crack through the dome
I got a pack of them niggas that leave a crack in yo skull

By myself, no one behind the attack
And fuck Sound Scan, I ain't BUYING that
Cause y'all sell em to the stores then buy 'em back
Now one hot storm, we'll fly and rap
If the rest of you provide is wack
I see creativity dying fast
I'm glad producers charge so high for they tracks (tell em why though)
Now they do it all, you just applying the rap
Honestly now, it's not the economy's down
Now rap dudes suck they own pee hole
The wacker the music the bigger the ego
Fans left suffering, gasping!
And it's embarrassing! Jump Off I'm the aspirin
I'm still hungry, I'm still fasting

We all 'Street Dreams', at one time or another
Fast cars, cash, money, hustlin', c'mon y'all, Desert Storm

Some niggas thug and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch

Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off

And quick to speed off on the jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin' money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin' the state
I'm like O, from the 'Wire', walk wit a sawed-off and a .8
When I was taught, never talk wit a snake

When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin' and weight
Get you wrapped up and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck wit niggas, if they soft or they fake

Only jail cats and niggas going back and forth
To court could relate, fuck wit me and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl
I specialize in torture and rape

We in the game most dudes ain't built for
Cain talk the type of shit, niggas get killed for
Whatever it's gon' be, let it be, I ain't waistin' a slug
And time is money and when it come to mind, take it in blood, nigga

Some niggas thug and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch

These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane
And ran to the cops to bring the tips of the last names
(Nigga)
Like I ain't bring the shipments and past caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains
(Nigga)

Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast range?
(Nigga)
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came
(Nigga)

Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped in my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance

I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen and start clutchin' it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter but I know, everything
About rollin' up, like a Dutch in a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter

One hit'll have the fiends yellin' out
They need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch us indict us
And the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga

Some niggas thug and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch

Listen, listen, I lived that life, of click-clack life
The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice
You prolly see that through ya bitch ass eyes
Still I'm that nigga that you get at why

Man forget that they knew me, remember me thug
I'm from that same block, rips snorkle on ja dip in a Lucy
'Member they back you down, when knives was out
.45 was out, scully ya eyes come out

But now could you hear nigga all in this place
That when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes and you wanna beef
Knowin' I'm slower than do so, 'cause I got much more at stake

Huh, that's why I'm ignorin' ya page
I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eating off rat, that same feat you think you capable of

Don't get me worng, I would like to get it
But you acting like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck wit my head

I'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst enemies
So if I make friends wit my worst enemies
That'll maybe even things out
But one in ya dome is easy, get it on if need be
Chrome for sheezy, please, don't believe me

Uh, uh
Proper set-off

Don't get it fucked up 'cause Sauce calm wit his grandma
'cause I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
'cause like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
'cause bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot glock
Blaaat!

I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
VA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me ""Your Highness""
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
'cause we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
'cause the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
'cause my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, glocks and lugers
AK's, are 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

[WC]
Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, 'cause lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly
'cause this'll leave your teflon holey
With the forty glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene
It's the Ghetto Heisman and the Drama King

[Joe Buddens]
It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

Give me a minute with one of your main bitches
Mental fitness I demonstrate
Right in front of your eyes
Watch your bitch elevate from a five to a nine
Confidence booster all in her mind
And I'm checkin' every dollar and dime

To the city where my committee chase titties and ass
[Are you ready? Come with me]
I'll show you where the check break fast
And we bust heads fast
If a nigga not in single file
Run up on him single style
Let the thing break him down
You love my methods
Take a nigga off the Earth if he on my shit list reckless
The key copper
Have to eat proper

Had to be proper

The jump off is jumpin' off proper

I still rep Walnut Street in deep East Oakland
The 100 block where you can your whole shit broken
Like Mystikal ""Still Smokin""
The life ??
And rent free
I never let nothin' live on my mind
I gotta grind [grind], shine
And fight for my grandma
And don't do nothin' stupid like Hammer
Til I go bankrupt
Steady drinkin' til I finish my cup
Then bust ya head before I shoot up the gut
Fresh outta Folsom and proper beef injections
Chosen selections
'cause girl I ain't fuckin' without protection
I'm harder than erection
Teachers so you study your lessons
And advise for that viewer discretion
On a scale to 1 to 10 I get 11
Give a toast to the pussy like Devin
And beat it up off Sprite and Seagram 7
I've plottin' on a way to get rich
And keep bread out that cock
And all the folks in the hood aimin' for head
Shots of lead poppin'
Situation's crucial
And every nigga I'm wit is feelin' neutral
Fuck takin' 10 paces
And drawin' down
This ain't no Western movie
Roll a Swisher, pass it to Ric
Sat the window wit the doobie
I'm lookin' at booty
Onion ass on the strip
You fine but baby girl where your whip
It's jumpin' off

[Chorus]
[Juvenile]
While I'm outtie on the West
I got the best weed
And the best hoes
I'm on the block at all times dressed in the best clothes
My focus is money 'cause pussy come natural
I only fuck wit those that can show me some collateral
I deal 'em all off top
I ain't a child molester or a killer
I don't need why'all props
Shit, if she wit me, she know what it is
We hotellin' and you don't deserve to go to the crib
If yo potna want to roll she can roll
I ain't gotta touch
I like to smoke and watch you freaky hoes
And I could have my choice
Enie, meenie, miney, mo
Bust a nut, get the fuck
Play it how it go
My main ho called and told me she made some money
I said ""Bitch you ain't never come gave it to me!""
How many woman now done want to get gangsta for me
Gotta be willin' to get down on your hands and stomach

Yeah, uhh, yo, uhh
I gotta be ""The Flyest"" like my homie from Q-be	
Niggaz know the Don be the sickest with jewelry
Niggaz seen the TS piece, and got they weight up
Do you see the size of this charm, Mr. Jacob
Nigga get your cake up, want to get bling'd out
Whether sky-blue or chinchill, I'm minked out
Down in Miami, bitches say they love me
Niggaz gettin mad cause the bitches want to fuck me
Always lend an ear when they man ain't listenin
Put somethin mean in they ear to glisten
Put 'em in the kitchen, let 'em get they bake on
Love it how your ass fallin out of the apron
We be makin love on the side of the road
in the back of the Maybach, the curtain is closed
You know how it go, we be laid back puffin the dro
Then it's back to the crib down on Coconut Grove
Youuuu know

Okay, hold up ? baby sweetie, lady darling
It's the, way you treat me; wait nah
It's the way I tap that last, she callin me pat that back
Ah dios mios when I smack that ass
It's that, pimped out demeanor
She pimped out with Senior, it's the good limp with the Nina
How I spit the 'caine game like I came from Yale
How the cops can't hold me, my name is bail
She tryna get up now, and zip to white-on-white Uptowns
to that white from Uptown that got her like what now
Got her tryna wine-dine, grind a little what now
Got her with a eye on eye in every club now
How I'm on the street with the steel
How I ain't gotta play the role; I'm bein myself, just keepin it real
Is it cause I'm givin her somethin that she could feel
Or how I get that change or is it just that name - JOEY!

[Chorus]
[Fat Joe]
Me and you..
Yo' momma and you girlfriends too..
We can take this to recharge..
And maybe we can do a men? - haha
It ain't shit, man my life's a movie
Keep your mom bitches, man I fuck me a groupie
She let a nigga beat it the back of the staircase
All the bitch need is a blunt and a Pelle, if that

[Joe Budden]
Dudes wonder why I'm M.I.A.
It's cause I'm back real quiet on the back of the bike in M-I-A
You can get up out that Hyundai boo
Lookin like she off the runway too
Meet me at the crib you can come straight through
Never shoes or pumps, 
straight boots like she strip at Sue's Rendezvous
But oops ? come cool with it, what you want do with it
Joe ma, remember the name and get used to it

Get things juicy, it's more than enough room in da jacuzzi
For you to lose the feeling of a groupie
Leave ya dude lose the feeling of a hoopty

Ends in me gettin' da skins to some DeBarge
Just 'cus she tellin' her friends it was garbage

Four a.m., gotta a babe on the cell
Five a.m., on my way to the tel
But then around six, same thing, different chick

Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed, a lot of repress lately
I got a company that I'm signed to
But they ain't in my company, when all I need is some company
When I start feelin' like everybody's done with me
I tryna see what everybody want with me
Then the mistress, yeah, the girl from ten minutes it's hard
Now I'm needing ten minutes from heart
I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
That I'll get into it, but I'll save that for the growth
Then it's rap beef, but I'm so secure with me
It's only rap beef, I don't need se-see you-rity (never)
Want to get at me, want to go to war with me
That's just one phone call for me
Check the shit, I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate
It's not the whole hood that appreciates me
What you gon' tell me, when it's the streets that made me
And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
And then it's rap critics, they say all I make dance music
But there almost anything you can dance to it
They ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album
Wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it
They say he wines to much, he's too bitter
They call it complaining, I call it explaining
I know 'em niggaz cooked it, caught up in the gaming
Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
Some shit with me, a dude's been knew that
But I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that
Rap ain't payin' the bills, it's mo money mo problems
Or it's no money mo problems
All enormous when you play at these stakes
That's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face
Then the album's pushed back, cause they say he needs a single at the moment
But what he needs is a single moment
Then I'm involved in the 'he say she say (that)
Send my mind on replay, each day
Then it's the bullshit that she save he's gave
Cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
Just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her
She'll say anything psych, but I ain't want to fuck her
I don't feel good, so I won't want to go to a club
Don't want to go to a lounge, just want to lounge
Then the same sweater that I had on for days
The same t I had on for a week what I got on, it speaks
What I got on, it reeks
No shape up, chilling, cause that's just how I'm feeling
And one day at a time, it's god willing
Tryna see scrape but the fall keeps building
Post start raising, the booze starting that gate me
But I gotta be a king cause this wolve's tryna play me
Goodie when it's hot like it's freezing winter
Bed start, eating sleep for dinner
Then it's hard tryna keep this in ya
So I write it all down, so one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
Then it's probation, I know we all go through it
We call it probation, but there's no pro to it
Yeah my soul's aching, only a few peers know
Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
Had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad
So I'm sitting here like what the bitch had
It's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true
Going what's popping, do he look happy to you
Now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
Bruised up and sloppy, a damaged like Ali
Up late talking to the fans on a website
That's the only thing that send yo man off to bed right
Fuck the world fuck my moms and my girl

Well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
This too won't last, this too shall pass
At least that's what I say y'all, that's what I pray for
And I'm the only thing that's standing in my way y'all
But I gotta be with me, it's no escape y'all
I guess depression just stepped in, and took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, hey Joe, I'm going home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
Cause I'm the only thing why've grown to, nigga
Look, I own you, nigga
Been with you since ten, but you starting to confuse me
Cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
Like how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you, Joe it's you and me
Still you don't want me to see you right
And why you always come get me, how we re-unite
Huh, I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
What, now, you got a deal and you want to get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe you live with me
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
And hope that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Just leave for a second, man it's been too long, and I can't troop it
And as long as you around I can't make that dance music

We at it again

Ok, I got my bathin' apes, check, outfit, check
No need to iron, might need to iron
Wit these jewels on, it?s likely they'll be iron
Ask mami dancin' beside me if she ridin'

Or what she sippin' on, mink got my fitted on
She somethin' vivid on, we came to get it on
Came to get it on, drink a lil' here
Everybody throw a drink in the air
It's goin' down, come on

I stepped in da party like whoa
What's da deal wit it? Ain't no hands in da air unless it's a drink wit it
Honeys lovin' 'cus they know I rock da bells in here
Thugs wit me 'cus they know I roll wit Kells and dem

Then I spot mami shakin' like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a jelly bean
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
And I'm glad I brought my ass to the right party

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no going home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Stack my chips, make dem hits and
I can tell that y'all love my shit
And got my shirt off, wit my Timbs on
Here all night so you know it's going on

Mami shake it like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a tangerine
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
Glad I brought my ass to the right party tonight

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

No more excuses, now in the two doors exclusive
And everything is all inclusive
We can do it all if my boys included
On da phone wit her friends invite 'em all, let's do this

Get things juicy, it's more than enough room in da jacuzzi
For you to lose the feeling of a groupie
Leave ya dude lose the feeling of a hoopty
New Kells playing feelin' on yo' booty

Keys to the Ferrar, leave in the garage
Starts wit a massage, ends wit ménage
Ends in me gettin' da skins to some DeBarge
Just 'cus she tellin' her friends it was garbage

Four a.m., gotta a babe on the cell
Five a.m., on my way to the tel
But then around six, same thing, different chick
XL mag, perfect fit, now to the bridge, let's go

Baby showin' me all these crazy things
Got me nibblin' on her belly ring
'Bout to get into the swing of things
She keep rubbin' againist my swinga thing

We off up in the other room so hot
Shorty's about to take off that pink tank top
All I wanna say is, shorty drop it like it's hot
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath

Got the keys to the game, and we locking this down
Underwater with the sharks, and we not gonna drown
Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound
They ain't no stopping us now, my nigga

[Freck Billionaire]
Ya clip trip, clip spit
Get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith and my rich sweats
Player haters talking 'bout they gonna get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than the shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar 'cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got rich like Federline
Fuck a g-pack, I'll show you how to read crack
You get it soft and then you rock it like T-Mac
The weed good price, plus it smoke speci
Three thousand full pound of some Dro Pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers
I'll let my homies spark ya
We in the spurs, that's faster than Tony Parker
This is family nigga don't ever cross my brother
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to god, the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best, hands down, like six-thirty

[Paul Cain]
Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate

Yo
Niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
Need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the bionic six
Who wanna fire, when guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is San-jaya, now who wanna try us
That four-five will spit
I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shade niggas couldn't get a tan from me
Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as his un-tuck BAM
Talking about you touch grams
I'm coming through your window something like +Brother Man+
It's just who we are
If I see yar, it's E.R
Vacay in D.R., shirt and jeans, g-star
Tell me how they gonna manage
Letting off Virgina Techs now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards
Every twenty-four, every half-hour
Niggas be trying to be Jack Bauer
So let fam' keep talking
You gonna need a ""Weekend At Bernie's""

[Red Cafe]
I guess it's left to me, the popcorn slinger, to pop off nigga
Callouses on my pop finger, pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still Keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For for the family, I'll be squeezing, no reason
Blood work, nobody leaving this bitch breathing
Niggas on the low, kidnapped my flow
Coulda asked for it, I woulda gift wrapped my flow
Don't gotta ask for it, I'm gonna sit back the fo'
Flip it around, let the handle crack ya jaw
East-side, west-side, I'll be in my Converse
This a convict rapping, It's a con's verse
Arm & Hammer mis-man, 'Los, Joey, or Ris-am
All they gotta do is chirp
And them things are gonna blis-am
Shake down, fiz-am
Straight from the Brooklyn borough that never riz-an
Block-ay block-ay

[Fabolous]
Now if they get me on wire traces
I'm gonna die in com-stat
I got prior cases from riding with firearms cocked
Fire bomb box, set up by your mom's block
Go off on time, 'cause it's wired by alarm clock
I get his legs, you grab him by arms lock
We gonna go this liar harm while his crying moms watch
Last seen in Brooklyn, they found in a Bronx lot
Rifles on the roof, yeah we got him by a long shot
We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on swat
And if they get me, Brooklyn gonna riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock
'Round here that's better than buying Viacom stock
Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give
I'll make his relative show me where the fella live
Ain't that his baby sis', get up in this Maybe' Miss
Before I pull this curb and start swerving like Baby sis
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors

This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So better not touch a branch on this family tree

Look,
I woke up without a heartbeat,
But I remember we was just in the car deep,
Was at a light, and got approached by a car thief,
He pulled out, but didn't ask for no car keys,
A loud noise without a voice, and I'm tryin' to scream out shits not fair,
I can't tell you where I'm at, or how I got here,
Surrounded by all white, maybe it's just cloudy,
Escorted by two men who knew everything about me,
Both of them so strong, kept sayin' hold on,
Feel like my souls gone, naked no clothes on,
I know this can't be my fate, I scream wait,
As they drop me in front of a gate, they left no trace,
I can see my every breath like a cold day, stood before a man with no face,
He said to me,
""Please don't make this any harder""
Who the fuck is you?
""My child, I'm your father""
I only got one dad,
""Is that a fact to you? He left you when you was young,
I brought him back to you, you're real close to heaven,
Few get to step in, now tell me what you've done to deserve to be let in""
Look I'm far from a christian, not big on religion,
But ain't done too much wrong, my entire time of living,
Never killed, never tried to, though I've been lied to,
Was once suicidal, never read the bible,
I've always been a caretaker, tried to nurse people,
At times it backfired, hurt people, hurt people,
Plus I never use your name in vain,
But you should know everything I'm being asked to explain,
""I know you stole from your mothers purse""
You can't count that, that was way back when,
""It's still a sin""
But I was ten,
""You robbed people, stolen""
Yea, and you made me see jail,
""But I also seen you lay your hands on a female,
Sold drugs to parents, none of that was needed,
Abandoned your child, on every girl you cheated,
Done wrong to people that only want the best for you,
Anytime you thought you were alone, I was right next to you""
When it comes to baby moms, God you gave me the worst one,
""But that was your second child, you shouldn't of killed the first one""
I ain't have a job, ain't have a pot to piss in,
""Look I gave you a gift, and you made the wrong decision,
Held on to resentments, even in doing business,
I lead by example, I teach forgiveness,
Your entry, can not be guaranteed,
Not when you live with Anger, Envy, Greed,
Pride, Sloth, Lust, even Gluttony,
Everything you shouldn't, if you would of joined my company""
Look I'm only human I ain't perfect,
""That I understand, when I take you out a jam,
You don't even think to worship, and when you do,
You never talk about what you can do for me,
You talk about what I can do for you,
I blessed you with health, family, and wealth,
With all the blessings you've received, you still always want help""
Yea there's been times in my life, I need help to make money,
But why everything I love, you manage take from me,
Yet, you still there and to question a nigga that tries hard
And finds a way, when you keep dealing him fucked up cards,
You make mistakes like me, far as I can see,
I think its a mockery, whenever rich niggas win the lottery,
Gave us Bush twice, God I hate to be rude,
But you let skinny niggas starve, give obese niggas food,
The nerve when you telling me, I don't deserve to stay here,
When you gave us drugs, and guns, you put Aids here,
Take a look at you, yo actions are the cold-hearted,
The hard shit is you bring babies in the world retarded,
I know most my actions put me in a cell,
But how you made at me, when you put me into hell,
""See my child, you need gratitude, maybe just a sample,
I never give a person, anything they can't handle,
Don't tell me about everything you've had to go through,
There's reasons for my actions, even if I never showed you,
Keep trying with you, all you did was hurt me,
Still gave you chances to prove that you were worthy,
And so I sat with you on a train, I asked you for change,
You kept callin' me names, probably didn't notice, I was the store clerk,
You put the gun to me, get money for more work,
My child, I know you have it in you to indeed stop,
This is not your final callin', just brief stop,
Hope you heed my words and understand,
So when I see you back, you should be a better man,
Look at life different, the next time we see each other,
There'll be no need to talk, whenever we meet each other""",Pray for Me,2009
Joe Budden,"Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh

Every time you're near baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
I don't know what to do

And oh baby
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool

My friends tell me
Somethin' has come over me
And I think I know what it is

I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you
In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Just the other night baby, I saw you hangin'
You were with your crew
I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turn and look me in my eyes
Boy you really blow my mind

I don't know what's gotten into me
But, God, I think I know what it is

In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you
I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes with you

Somethin' strange has come over me
Got me goin' out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside

I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you
I think I'm in love
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you (goin' outta my mind)
I think I'm in love
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you

Joe Budden,"Nothing stays the same forever, not even me

Check this, check it

Something must've changed me, niggas might defame me
But things that used to taint me, no longer seem to restrain me
Strangely I'm no longer sad, mad or angry
Shame-ably it pains me, feeling like this just ain't me
Mainly what do I tell all the people that thanked me
Mainly those who ordain me, aside from can you blame me
Motivation again was supplying me is no longer providing me
Jason Williams something killed whatever was driving me
Worrying less about the past more about the now
Less about what I'm going through more about the how
It's for certain it's been thirty years being fit for hurting
Now I'm a different person with nothing to overcome in the mist of burdens
For certain, got 6 figures in my sock drawer
And honestly this year I expect to make a lot more
It's hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
In a house that's so peaceful that I'm trying to disrupt it
Scream fuck it not because I have to but because I love it
Which makes me as fake as the puppets that I speak of disgusted
Without a paddle up shit's creek
Dig deep and see it ain't life it's just me
So be warned as I'm putting on like I'm deformed
Only so y'all can accept it as being my norm
Maybe I quit working on me, maybe I given up
Maybe I been lying to myself maybe I give a fuck.

[Chorus]
It's enough to make you black out, pull a mac out
Aim it at the sky while I'm running from a black cloud
Every day we playin' cat and mouse as I watch it hoverin' over my glass house
It's enough to make you spazz out, pull a mac out
Aim it at the sky while I'm running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud.

I say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
Trying to make my girl get it she don't know that it's very scary
But she's a nympho she can come barely near me
She still want the God in her, think she's mary mary
The prettiest bitches just want to service me
While niggas prettiest bitches wouldn't get a word from me
Some of you haven't heard from me, some of you wouldn't mind murking me
Found that news funny likes its straight from Ron Burgundy
These niggas ain't never seen dough
They can't dream though I bump into 'em in between shows
People say I'm emo, what that really mean though?
Is though the song can't breathe I actually make it seem so
I lost loved ones because they couldn't deal with me
Cherish whoever still with me though the marriage be killed in me
Normally it's just me and my lonely mind
Everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
Fans recognize my misery uplifted me
Shifted me to my epitome, guess the curse is a gift to me
Maybe it's serendipity, maybe it's weighing on me physically
Maybe I should man up and tell God not to solicit me
Been medicated, meditated
Sedated, hated
Character assassinated, all theses years I masqueraded
Hard headed, if it was on my mind I had to say it
Tongue on the devil's pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
Rap is fabricated, rappers are so exaggerated
Wouldn't be scared of the truth if they weren't castrated
Grab a mag, spray it, surrounded by people to shoot it before me
Better unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
Now lemme speak to who I cater to
Would you love me to sang before my weeks were not favorable
Promised to maintain being unique but relatable
All while suffering from a disease that could do away with you
Poetry on the beat, spoken-word for the masses
Therapy over pro-tools, every word is on acid
Consonants on Kush, every vowel is blunted
Highly wanted this whole organization privately funded
This is bigger than the Eiffle, this is alert to public
Had a cop us by our tunnels and our bridges with the rifle
Sentences meant to stifle, this is a man aching
This is the dam breaking, contraband in the making
This is panic unveiling, got potential but I never met it
He be trying to come over, it seem like God won't let it
Either he never got my invite or he just dismissed it
But if all I'm hearing are the sounds of blackness, why am I pessimistic?
You'll never progress if you'll never try
All I ask, let every word I birth never die
My wings spread, but when I'm at the sky
Weather didn't change like I thought and had me petrified.

[Chorus]",Black Cloud,2010
Joe Budden,"You ain't gon believe this but, you used to fit right here
I'd hold you up and say to your mother
This kids gonna be the best kid in the World
This kids gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew
And you grew up good and wonderful, it was great
Just watching everyday was like a privilege
Than the time comes for you to be your own man, and take on the World
And you did, but somewhere along the lines, you changed, you stopped being you!

Shout to all my fans, glad I can inspire y'all
Got a couple haters, still trying to acquire more
You're praying to a higher power hoping I should fall
But even my writers block ends in a fire wall
Everybody acts reckless judging by they past efforts
If they ran shit why it won't show up in they track records
How can the critics ever hear me and say I'm a suffer
How when they play with words and I make em' play with each other
Choppers over the booth, ready for prime time
Come one with his thoughts, intertwine with his mind
Go toe to toe, blow for blow or do it rhyme for rhyme
Be competitive coke heads and go line for line
Honestly that crap of yours you should raffle off
With me they getting Genius Bars without the Apple store
Under the microscope I rebut' the scrutiny
If I'm to be compared it's only to who I used to be
Take a closer look at rappers and you might discover
This faggots talking Boxing, avoid the Mike Buffers
Now you the type to cuff her, me I get tired of her
See you the type to get hype to hug her but won't try to fuck her
No pencil thin bitches, me that ain't the style he dates
Might sit on her face and leave the imprint of a smiley face
Introduce the newcomers to my habitat
The calms before the storm, this the debris from the aftermath

Let me tell you something, here right now
The World ain't all sunshine and rainbows
It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are
It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it
You, no nobody is gonna hit as hard as life
But it ain't about how hard you hit
It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward

Let me change pace, the alternate route is a long one
But you'll ultimately end up in the same place
So I tell aspiring artists ""think beyond greater""
I know some niggas with platinum plaques and bronze paper
But better living should be earned, never fed or giving
So I traded my recognition instead for a vision
They always told me that I'd end up dead or in prison
Who ever thought that same dude getting head while he whipping
At the chick would hang up on, give em' the dial tone
Now buying wild homes, straight cash without loans
I always managed to do better when his doubts shown
I'll teach you how to turn them diamonds into milestones
Class is in session, and look who's come to tutor
They passing the fake off as real like Brian Pumpers jeweler
Where I'm from niggas with fear getting slumped by shooters
But my equal to dumping rugers is being done by computers
I'm getting bread, every verse like the lotto
Give them substance but they treat every word like it's a hollow
My niggas off parole I'm tryna give them something pure to follow
Cause he ain't have a pot to piss in, just a urine bottle
I come from where so many people where raised with neglect
Cops trying to meet they quote, thirsty to make an arrest
All my wrong doings did, was put my faith to a test
Which made me much stronger, guess my mistakes were correct

Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what you're worth
But you gotta be willing to take the hit
Not pointing fingers saying you're not where you wanna because of him or her or anybody
Cowards do that and that ain't you
You better than that",Come Along,2010
Joe Budden,"Uh, I got bitches on my dick, I don't want 'em there.
Closet full of brand names, I don't wanna wear.
Everybody got advice that I don't wanna hear, world in ya palm,
But you don't wanna share, still, I'm followin' you.
Are you leadin' me with the weapons drawn?
Co-dependent on her, but got me in bed alone.
You say if you love it, let it go.
Nothin' set in stone, plus every rock they throw, I use as a stepping stone.
Got questions, say the answers better left unknown.
No I may not never see you, I should know you never gone.
So I break the mirror cause, everything it's showin' me is wrong.
Grab your hand and go along, cause I'm followin' you.
Say I should be pleased, what if I'm saddened?
Always say I been through worse, what if I haven't?
But if that holds true, here's the lesson,
If you keep your head down, you might miss out on the blessing.
Sing!

[Chorus]
I don't need the money, I don't need the fame.
I don't need the lifestyle, I don't need the pain.
I don't need the clubs, I don't need the cars.
None of that really matters to me.
I don't want the bad bitch, I don't want the strain.
I don't want the high, enough shit on the brain.
I don't want whatever's gonna help me be sane,
I just wanna follow your lead.

You sayin', ""follow my lead, follow, follow my lead""
Brought me to my knees, she must wanna holla at me.
When the world feel like swallowin' me,
When every decision costly, and I ain't got a dolla on me.
Check it, I don't wanna pretend, I don't wanna live a lie.
I don't wanna be judged, don't wanna be criticized.
I don't wanna talk, if nothin' I wanna say,
Boy, I let 'em get to know me, the more they just runaway.
And that, must be your way of sayin' we should stay together.
I know how to fuck it up, more then I can make it better.
I figured folk around me would learn to take it better,
Instead of tryna change me, I been this way forever.
Time will reveal, more will be shown.
You pushed it, I thought the door closed on it's own.
But uh, nevermind what caused it, livin' a dream,
Nothin' in this world powerful enough to pause it.
Sing!

[Chorus]

Sayin' ""follow my lead, follow, follow my lead.""
Cig in my mouth, prescription bottle by me.
And even when I think you might be making a mistake,
I may not know the destination but I make it there safe.
Check it, when I feel like I can't get weaker, uh
You always come and make a cameo or feature.
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac's looking from heaven saying ""They ain't understand me neither""
Alotta times you leave me exposed,
And laugh at me, still thinking I could be in control.
Help me weather the storm, altogether I ain't norm.
Cause I always disagree, though you ain't never been wrong.
Listen, I was feeling nearly unstoppable,
And now I'm facing what appeared to be impossible.
Feeling unimportant enough to have to bother you.
But I'm down here alone nigga, all I got is you.

[Chorus]

Uh, follow my lead.
Ohhh, follow my lead.

(Check it, YAOWA)
I can't fit it all in a 16,
The night that I was tipsy,
And all them bullets just missed me.
The day they rushed the block,
I was strapped, but they didn't frisk me.
Why I ain't fuck that stripper?
Don't ask, and now she sick B.
The drop on that jewelry store for 50.
And I backed out last minute like ""nah, this shit look risky""
One of my mans dead, the other one in pikipsy?
'nother one in the feds, he'll be there until he's sixty.
I wanna thank you for the blessings and the gifts.
And the lessons and the messages they left, I get the drift.
Fuck the cheddar or whatever, it don't measure up to this.
I mean, never did I ever not remember you exist.
When I hop up out my bed, here's together,
And our wish, is what you is from the heart,
Inside my chest, you let it tick.
I love you from my soul, with every spiritual molecule.
Fuck twitter, all a nigga gotta do is follow you.

[Chorus]",Follow My Lead,2010
Joe Budden,"Check, it's time to educate a lercher if your featherweight by nurture
Looking for a fix, I'm here to medicate, nurtured
Was putting this shit off, and know I hesitated further
Even me thinking bout it is premeditated murder
So if when I levitate it disturbs ya
You ain't gotta ask who I dedicated this verse to
You brothers I tried to see shit in all shades
So I'm prep when they finally show they true colors
Ain't gotta worry about who I'm trying to appeal to
If all I do is keep it in fif, what up Phillip Hughes
Public Enemy, all I'm just missing Terminator X
Now who am I gonna terminate next?
Hearing all sorts of fables probly
Who if you choose to believe will have you thinking I'm unstable
Contrary to belief I weighed all I brought to the table
And decided that relationships wasn't worth being faithful
Words from the wise: When you lie make sure the trail is gone
And don't expect a happy ending less you in a nail salon
Nigga
I'm at a time before drugs should starts
It makes sense, I'm being framed I'm a work of art
But if you broke tho
Don't, blame the economy
Don't, come with a handout
Don't, try to (?)
See, I never ask niggas to come and be fond of me
You met your match now, what up Eharmony

Hello expectations, know I had to greet you
It don't matter where you at, Ill always come and meet you
Hello expectations, we can skip the small talk
Probly thought I disappeared and thought that I was all talk
What you been smoking?
You keep getting higher
But that ain't ever been a problem, I keep getting nicer
Hello expectations, who do it like me?
I think you got a good idea of who it might be

Been in this game 8 years, ain't fell off, no bragging
Its just been a lot of John Doe and toe taggin'
The jeans have, any foot wear is old is old fashion
Bought these Jordans maybe do some Bo Jacksons
All I'm hearing is coke rapping with no passion
From dudes getting fuck like something Chris Stokes imagined
Black Benz, fruck an art class no wagon
Way I'm on that turn pipe you will think the pope passing
If you got an assessment of what I represent
Its more then likely negligent if we was never friends
Popping shit online, haven't even met me
Yous a pussy and a bush, Kardashian and Reggie
Hello Expectations, I should look familiar
Every time we meet you tell me ain't nobody realer
Whatever you expect from me, I always go beyond that
And you be looking shock as if we lost contact
So if you knew me, you would get why my man is off drastic
Strong minded, a lot of people cant handle that tactic
To keep it real, politics always hand to the masses
And I rebel cause all I wanna do is hand them a classic
Nobody gotta be right, just a lamp and a mattress
'Til my accountant pull the trigger Ill hamper they asses
I'm in a fine lint and (?) hand them a fabric
Bad bitches, fast cars no Danika Patrick
Audience is die hard so if my fans spazzin'
You might see the first drive-by from a ban wagon
I'm not a role model, I never claim to be the
World would be fruckd up if
Y'all was the same as m I'm
Not to be copied off of
Not to be emulated
This music ain't the club more
So to be stimulated
A nigga far from perfect when you hear the pencil stated
That I would try to be your
That I would demonstrate it
The naysayers talking
It seems I been degraded
And tho I hear their words
None of them penetrated
So when it's cold I
Maker sure I'm isolated
A little food for thought
Hope your mental can take it

Hello expectations, know I had to greet you
It don't matter where you at, Ill always come and meet you
Hello expectations, we can skip the small talk
Probly thought I disappeared and thought that I was all talk

You keep getting higher
But that ain't ever been a problem, I keep getting nicer

I think you got a good idea of who it might be",Hello Expectations,2010
Joe Budden,"Pray for me, need y'all to just pray for me
Pray for me, somebody just pray for me
Somebody pray for me, need y'all to just pray for me
Somebody pray for me, need y'all to just pray for me
Now if it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over the coals through the fire
I thought the toll would be lighter
Make sure that blunt is rolled a little tighter
I tell 'em I'm just looking for some piece of mind
But they say I'm only working with a piece of mine
If I'm a do it it be on my own accord, no crutch
Swear to god I've never called upon the lord so much
Play the corner of the club, laughing at the wanna-bes
It's ironic cause they everything I wanna be
Would light a ton of reef
But that's gon' unleash
Everything I'm trying to hide underneath
Then I'd lose all I've earned
And if there's two things that I've learned
Is I'm the only thing at stake
And when you the only thing real
Really you the only thing fake
It must be time to escape from that
And fuck rhymes, might be time to escape from rap
Why should I be the only nigga to escape from the act?
So I lie since everybody just escapes from facts
Yo that sucka shit niggas be on I can't dig it
Joe won't lose even if you plan to rig it
Yeah, nothing to prove, with no fear of how I'm depicted
I'm here, won't move, I don't care to be evicted
You don't like how I move?
Well I ain't gonna keep still
Any nigga want me killed
Wanna leave me in the streets peeled
Well if it happens it happens, I believe in free will
Just know that ain't how we built
I'll call niggas that'll dead you for a cheap thrill
When the clips empty, they gonna try to refill
And I'm a be the dude to try and stop 'em like, ""please chill.""
Y'all know all I'm about
They keep putting up roadblocks
I keep finding alternate routes
Now success seems likely everybody wanna try me
I'm all for it, can't trip me up
I won't fall for it
I'm just a man without a care
Neighbor to heartache, roommate with despair
Reminded my past is darker
Cause when A.M. died I was staring at Travis Barker
Wishing it was something I could say to make him cheer up
And so I prayed Ã¢?? he teared up
I ain't wanna see him go through that
The same shit that I feel, never showed you that
Cause it's none of nobody's business
And it just makes you look weaker
Every joke is just smoke
Look deeper, nevermind, don't bother
Some of y'all smarter
Enough ain't got sense that if you try harder
You'll get a glimpse of everything that I harbor
We all ain't got the strength to be a martyr
So to everyone who ever loved me:
I apologize and I'm sorry
Wholeheartedly, can't change it's just part of me
Not music, shit's art to me
Too fucked up to drive, here's the car keys
I don't care where we go, get it far from me
Choices I don't wanna make
I know I have to
Worlds going faster
So my ride or die chose the latter
I'm looking for a rush out of habit
Truth is, there is such thing as too much for a addict
Ain't the nigga I'm belittled as, riddle that, nigga come from middle class
If you speak to me, show a little class
Dropped out of school, a nigga couldn't sit through class
Learned to fall asleep through the sound of a pistol's blast
I come from where dad taught mom to get high
She's strong so we still got by
When I picked up the drug why the fuck was they surprised?
If it wasn't for your genes I wouldn't lust the supply
I come from a whole hood, telling me that I'm next
Handed me a mag, must've known that I was Complex
They say that you a wild individual
You just not getting my style, you too typical
Now everybody got a word for me
Shit y'all deem important ain't pertinent to me
Put your opinion with a feather, balance that
Grab medicine, when the success and the talent match
Now pray for them",Pray for Them,2010
Joe Budden,"These niggas losing their minds
You find that there's no reward
They say they already home
It's really clear they abroad
They sound like they boxed in
It's not just where they record
There's a cost to be the boss they can't clearly afford
Swear to the Lord, there's guns like the audience
You put on a show, my forty clearly applauds
Sittin' fifth row, I might appear to be bored
Plotting on a Kanye, but screaming where's my award
Ballin' out of control, never won an ESPY
Bout to buy a black ghost and call that shit SP
Flow outta this World, I'm coming for my Moon man
You niggas slide back like that walkin' on the moon dance
No glitter glean, handgun with a beam
Have some boys follow you, street fam, twitter team
Like you could fuck with me
Oh did it seem, Dr King and Def Jam ain't the only ones with a dream
I'm a grown ass man, this kid a teen
You're a spoof of me like if hip hop did a scream
Audi coupe looking good so I went and copped it
Got that TT poppin' like a trending topic
My ride is matte black
My pride is that jack
It might get ya dog shot, even a cat smacked
Anyway though, styles don't apply to me
Jeff Goldblum couldn't be more fly to me
Shorty say right after the suck fuck proof
You hit it on the head girl, duck duck goose
You shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce
Break em off and leave it
You seen my fucked up tooth
It's fucka bitch, there's more fish in the aquarium
I rarely hear no, like when niggas ask you to marry them
There's no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from
Funeral fab, I'm just here to bury them

Reporting live from the beacon
Booth tired from the beatin'
Had foreplay all day
Prepin' the beatin' the mic for a threesome
With my vocal's bi-coastal, speakin' til their eyes totaled
Mr wi-fi, out a franchise go to
Magic, standby local's
Watch the track bust once I show my dick size to the pro-tools
I teach you how to have models screaming get behind me
E-pills and maybach's ain't gon matter if your tip is tiny
Nevermind me, we could get knee deep in the beef
Seek me with the heat but you'll need more to keep me on a leash
Here's a cc for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
Invest in Rockports and be easy on your feet
Give a few hammers, a few semi's and a few snubs to a few crips,
Couple vampire's and true bloods
Gambling in casino's, have a hundred handing me my c-notes
The modern day gambino
I'm careful every step I take
You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
That'd be the last mistake you ever make
Me I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade
Like groceries when I'm shooting at fags
Make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred
Dudes is falling off doing all they can to save it
But everybody's run stops ask Brandon Jacobs
What y'all call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blatt at me that'd equal more casualties
Abort the strategy
Or get attacked with that Duracell they put in your back
Now that's assault and battery
You can keep the bitching to yourself
There's beams on every burner
These lasers, a petition wouldn't help!
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss?
Where I'm from, better be careful when you drive that whip
Niggas put they life at risk for pies that flip
In my town Ben Affleck wouldn't try that shit
And if he did he'd get turned around burnt down
Tell 'em new jacks it'll be a while fore they eligible to earn the crown

Acid out the baggie
This is more than dope
Flawless flow
Fucking off a sign every horoscope to wore my robes
Strappin' up the corner cold, critical
Unquestioned, my opponents know
I shoot like Capone, watch me own the show
Chromatose, toasted, getting money while I roam the coast
Stones and boats, mansions, homes, and hopes
I deserve 'em both, overdose
Time to earn my votes, watch me turn the volts
Voltage through a hater, this electric chair, danger
Yeah, I see ya
Now make way fore it turn to diarrhea
Hear a microphone will give you 3 of everything I wear yeah
Models by the pair, swear, bottles, private Lear, steer
Style that's outta here, rare, thousands by the chair, square
Sleep with me, you came here, war with me is scary
Get beat silly tryna lamp here, better bring your theory heat
I got a drop damp here, niggas try me barely
No one breathes, I need an ants ear, precious necessary
Got my mind on the cheddar kill my haters together
Bury em in abundance and starve there family's stomach's
Paper come in my thumbage, brand new fifties and hundreds
On point, just like the drum is
I'm warning them baby mothers
Got the hunger of a broke rapper
Kill you while I'm rollin' up then smoke after
Catch you at your show, snatch ya, empty out the dough faster
Bentley off the scene, magnum Mo splasher, four packer
Southside nigga spittin' coke at ya!

This is for the fronters and the naysayers
I'm about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
They say I'm out of my league on this one
So when I get done I want you to cut your fuckin' ears off, Twitpic 'em!
Lord, I want you to leave this vicinity
You gon be around here bout long as Justin Bieber's virginity
This is Jesus identity, mixed with weed
Hennessey, Kennedy, King
Mixed with a kill or be killed, killer regime
Ill as you seen, switch
Y'all write all that hard shit then you fall right off, it's horrible
My oracle is all I offer, so before I borrow
You won't be here tomorrow flow
Sorry, I will probably adios my body with somebody toast
This shit just practice
Sickest rapping Baptist
Kill your pastor, steal your Chapstick
After that make you kiss a cactus
Then, take your hoe, make the hoe give the whole clique fellatio
Everyone, that wasn't the whole entourage on HBO
Then after that, I tell her, I can't do much with you, shawty!
I just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire buffy the body!
Don't call us if the bitches ain't flawless
If they are then we can hang like Aretha Franklin bra-less
The drunk me can box like the sober you
The sober me be more nervous than Waka Flocka in the voting booth
We beef like being deep and dumping K's
You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist
Y'all get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
My feng shui is a pump in the desert
You'll come up shorter than an Asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
While my wolf pack looks for strippers and cocaine
Niggas snitching, it's a shame
We call em male tattlers
Fiends touching they noses more than URL battlers
It's hard to spit saliva when you spit fire
So I'll just pour sugar in your gas tank
Put a banana in your tailpipe

Joe Budden,"I be at the mall, walk up in the store
Glance up at the wall, pick out a few kicks
I need 11's in these, matter of fact while you at it bring em' in a size 6
I take shorty's shoes off, like here try on these J's make sure them shits fit
But in my head it gets thick, saying ""Joey fall back, cause that's not your kid""
I don't know you lil nigga, and plus I got a son of my own
But he's at home and the ways hes being raised I don't really condone
Naw, cause his pops been gone, fuck it I'll explain it to him later when he's grown
Old enough to have a phone
Asking why mommy hate me and he got the sneak to call me whenever he's alone so
You wouldn't know it but I got a soft spot for you
See, we would shared the same obstacles
Looking from the outside may seem like you neglect him
But when he slips up and calls me dad, I correct him
I protect him, when baby girl start venting about you I say ""Respect him!""
And though it seems out of order, my own mistakes have turned me into your biggest supporter
Fast forward, you wouldn't believe how I could love like mine what I didn't conceive
Trying to help him reach shit what I never achieved
Am I doing it for him or is it my own greed cause see,
Me and my baby moms, we don't do the conversations
Some cramped in the back, two bedroom shack
With seven people living there just congregating
So when your child with me, I'm over compensated
I'm talking eight bedrooms seven baths
My son thinking, that's the shit that only heaven has
Mines gotta keep it cool, your's get to see the view
White marble around the end ground, heated pool
Mines got to go through the ""why""
Shit, yours just got to walk outside
And the funny shit, the irony of it all and it's just sad
Is You walked away and I'm the step dad
And then you get on Skype, saying ""how you being, what's the word""
And I be on the background listening like ""this mudafuckers he got some nerve""
He says ""bye daddy, I love you""
I be wanting to snuff you but wouldn't want him thinking less of you
But, hes perceptive and this shits wild, he picks up on everything and hes just a child
So through all my resistance, I'm afraid this two year old can already see the difference
He see's you don't provide when you're capable
Why we never fix things while were still able too?
So you're annoyed, it kinda of hampers me
Get my boy, I always wanted a family
Just to greet when I get to the door
You gon have to take the L, I can't give you your's
I'll do all the work, you ain't gotta be bothered
You can be his dad, I'll be his father
I relate though, so I know it hurts
Got to be uncomfortable when the roles reversed",Role Reversal,2010
Joe Budden,"Check it
No regrets, nigga no regards
I know the bar, raise mine, y'all can lower y'alls
What I lack in talent, I normally show in heart
Prolly why they want the encore before the show can start
So if you in my life, know ya part
That's the best way for us to never grow apart
Even through the mid-life crisis', y'all know who the nicest is
Always tell it like it is in spite of it
Dudes frontin' quite a bit, know I've grown tired of it
Sometimes you'd rather just watch the movie than write the script
Authentic, ????
More vintage, y'all mimic, all gimmick
I ridicule what's been done
See I ain't fooled by what's spewed bout they income
Lose some you win some
Perception, shit'll give you grey hairs and then some
Inception are you living a dream of livin' in one
Haters see me get to thinking that it cant be all good
So I just kill them with the car, Brandy Norwood
And keep chasin' success that y'all scared of
Done carryin' dead weight, I'm no longer the paul bearer
Check, I'm too grown for all the games I don't play with suckers
I'm on the sideline, just watchin' the dave and busters
But when you think of Joe this is unrefutable (Not a word, he means irrefutable)
The paint is fucked up, but the picture gon' be beautiful

It's gonna be a short summer
'Cause most of y'all ain't built to last
It's gonna be a short summer

It's gonna be a short summer

It's gonna be a short summer
A new season has begun

Which wrong are you an heir to
How can I be compared to
Nigga you fallin' off with a parachute
Ya stack short, you got some earnin' to do
You new school, just means you got some learnin' to do
I don't care to argue
You to easy to tear apart through
What I hear is partial, that whole project is Sarah Marshall

And I dont know what type of shit you on
I tried to make you get the point but you was Chris Duhon
So where Ray Felton when you need em
When niggas show you who they really are you should believe them
Catch me with the top down, turnpike speedin
Bout to have Jersey on fire like Cleveland
With my back in the wall I ain't never got slayed shit
Lebron was king until that pressure got Wade
So if you marry the game I'll be at the alter waitin
With some niggas I don't call 'til it's an altercation
Less bail money, less court cases
More mile high, more vacation
More of my back rubbed, more of my feet massaged
Had me thinkin she invented face time Steve Jobs
They can't stay afloat, they proll need a mention
We in two different boats, but yours need an engine
Nerve of you niggas I earth you niggas
Took the mirena out of shorty, gave birth to you niggas
Dog, I hear everything you say
You Steve Irwin to a upset stingray
A lighter to a upset Jean Grey
Now who's hotta, you notta
True scholar, new prada, a few dollars
Niggas want to hit em with the chrome like Blaka
I'm waiting for them when they get home like Posada
How did he compare a stove to hells kitchen
That just make a man real mad, Mel Gibson
So death to all the bullshit by any means
Kill em all, hang em from the ceilin using skinny jeans
For aspiring rappers that want to pop a can
For the families of Sean Bell, Oscar Grant
Nigga ya heat wave is almost up
Playing for keepsake you almost fucked
So when you talk about Joe
When you done being critical
Say the painter was wild
But he made sure the portrait was original

Parks wat up",Short Summer,2010
Joe Budden,"I broke down a while ago
Finally picking up the pieces
Memoirs I had are undefeated
I feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
Its been so many times I've lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut
Don't want you to notice me
Roll with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback I fee l like I got the right too
So if you need a case in point you can refer to Budden
And it will prove that pain killers never murdered nothing
All it did was make me succumb put ice in me
Now revenge is the place it takes me from
I'm strong

[Chorus]
Strong enough to catch contact (?)
Smell it as soon as you get in my ride
See with me, rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really f-ck with me
Tell me if you wanna ride or die, la la la la la la la la

Listen up as the center reports
My inner thoughts are like a inner war
Head exact as a trembling force on my mental ward
Men are distraught
Every word from his sentence the boss
It's brought to you like the people your minister's Porsche
Tight roping on dental floss
Before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost
When as soon as the temperature frost I'm probably
Having intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condo's at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to accidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws
Until then lets let the bass kick
Take the shots great I don't see a need to chase it
Trying to fight the urge til there's something to replace it
I welcome ya'll to be my co-pilots on this spaceship

[Chorus]

Yo, me and the game would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
They make sure you bring change for a hundred
Rob em, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the breaks off em
Then how the f-ck was he gon pedal off
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pac gave my mom the needle like go on try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga can harm me
So I go and scoop a mommy that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her, bet you wouldn't mind shilling it
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took like a soldier
Since she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start to handle life you'll be on the same level

[Chorus]

Crooked I
When I was five this what my father said
I should have pulled you out and left you on your momma's waterbed
You asked me, my poppa's dead
Alcoholic jeans from him since a toddler bottle fed
Put me on your stainless I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
My life was the craziest
Surprised I'm even walking, can you blame me if I'm atheist
But I ain't Stephen Hawkings
I know God is in my radius
I can see him walking in the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher,s talking
My people sleep in coffins I miss em I'm breaking 
Down in the face of a bad bitch that I'm supposed to be taking down
Baby ride while I'm crying, I'm dying inside
Cause my pain is beside a giant leviathan and I'm hiding from the World
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic? same place I vomit when I lick a drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think!

Maybe it wouldn’t had started at all if I had your life
Maybe it was needed or was I thinking immorally
If I wasn’t myself could I say I gave the fans All of Me?
Can’t decide if I’m more ashamed of what they saw of me
Than I am of ignoring all the lessons that was taught to me
Headed up field but couldn’t dodge the last tackler
How could a forward thinker move so ass backwards?
How could a dude with no regrets at all, willing to bet it all
Not realize that quicker demise, how could I neglect it all?
I’m so seasonal, some of y'all knew I'd spring back
With a heart this cold, how'd y'all think I’d be receptive to fall
I’m plenty comfortable when danger’s around
And even more so when strangers around
And the bigger picture is sicker, don't know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
Don't know a nigga, don't know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes

Thought I could keep it all a secret, I convinced myself

Numb to my words now, maybe felt I was open
I cut so many people loose, do I need help with devotion?

Lord, my girl cried me a flood than me a river
That’s love, depending on me when I’m a dependent on liquor
I’m up in the shoe store, she got no love to show
You ever look at a bitch you was fucking behind your bitch back
Like fuck I was fucking you for?
I’m an artist so I’m intelligent
I would tell you to do some soul searching
But it’s hanging up in my closet with your skeleton
It’s gotta be a God's work, even a diamond gotta be polished first
A quarter's on the loose and I ain’t been out here getting my dollars’ worth
I had to remove the goggles first
To see through the sipping Patrón and fifty phoners for I need to go get me a kidney donor
Guru, Nate Dogg, go ahead blink a eye
The doctor told me you close, go 'head drink and die
Buried under the stone where the Patrón fifth sits by
That reads ""Here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy""

As of late been having revelations bout this hate term
Hate the way they judged me, till I got the case adjourned
Hated the belly of the beast till I became its tapeworm

Though I’m the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
They say my brain is off, I say how can it be?
If I’m out my mind, how can I be in-sanity?

They don’t know how hard a nigga tried to advance
But I don’t know who’s more to blame, is it them for really not knowing me
Or is it me for never really giving them a chance?
Get too close, be too big of a threat
Now I spend little to no time, thinking why I ain’t get rid of you yet
Gotta recognize my maturity, gotta see I’m grown
Let all my skeletons out the closet, just so I'd never be alone
Since I got trust issues I won’t discuss with you
Besides God tell me who the fuck’s supposed to save you
Pop won't have a man to man, was gone half my life so
Somewhere in his head probably feel it ain't his place to

It's my life, my struggles, can't help it
I'm just grateful that He kept me alive for me to tell it
Check it, see the music industry changed me
It was everything that I'd have never guessed it was
So my discography is all full of hand-me-downs
I couldn't figure out another way to dress it up
So every verse spiked with the truth
Nah, no one know me better than this mic and this booth
It's no better way, I owe my todays to my yesterdays
You live with regrets, probably die with em too
So I trust God more than myself, I'm trying to tell ya
Drunk in the basement, now I'm in the wine cellar
I learned to never let the fear settle in
And now I'm more prepared than I've ever been
Not one ounce of hate in my glass
Just one of the things OG taught me way in advance
Said it's two types of folk in this world
Got the ones that's out doing it
And those busy saying they can't

I give you my all
But it seems like that's not enough
Letting you get more of me
So while the world keep on changing
The one thing remaining is
I keep letting you get more of me

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
You know some niggas never learn
Some learn and never apply, but wait
Some apply but never teach
My only right to preach, I spent time being each
Grab that magnifying glass I need ya'll to look closer
At the only dude to do every drug and get lower
If niggas knew a third of all the weight that he shouldered
They'd know it an insult to think I'm only bipolar
I got a unique talent, don't know how I obtained it
How do I sustain it? Can't even explain it
I get more info from words that aren't spoken
More fixated on people or things when they are broken
I used to think everybody was pure
Now I'm busy trying to come up with everybody's cure
And that mindset led to close alarms
It be the people you help most, normally do the most harm
Baited my whole life, most times I ain't bite
So no need to stick to a script that I ain't write
Preconceived notions, nothing less than a failure
Base you's off of the cover and miss the best-seller
While I'm at it, let me tell you about this angel I met
She was fly, from every angle was fresh
And the way that she was jamming to the song called 'I'm Not Perfect'
Made me wanna know what her imperfections were
Now listen, and they weren't hard to find yall
Both parents were addicts like mine are
Mi-nor, but her story wasn't new to me
Most her life, shorty was homeless like I used to be
Could tell she never felt appreciated
Looked too much like her dad, was her mom's least favorite
Picture a bond supposed to be sacred
Looking up at your mom's eyes and seeing hatred
Pop left when she was young
Well she still young and he still gone, keep it 100
While I'm just amazed that a woman so beautiful
Could go through such ugliness and not become it
World keeps spinning, learned sinners keep sinning
And I can't even tell her some fights ain't fight worthy
Cause my pops got 20 years clean, but her pops got 20 years dirty
She moved to Jersey where he happens to reside
Thinking they'll be closer but it's only fiction
Cause she so young, all it does is cause friction
God picked the right nigga though, to teach about addiction
Years ago she should've been on homi' watch
So check the time out, just not on mommy watch
Cause someone beat her ass for years, someone calmly watched
Na, stepdaddy beat her ass, mommy watched
I keep her closer than ever she always next to me
Bisexual, comfortable sexually
I’m talking more comfortable than she should ever be
Especially considered the fact she was molested three
Times, some things a picture doesn’t tell
Can’t be worth a thousand words or her pictures might yell
Ya’ll see a pretty face on Instagram
I see a girl that should be scarred, never lent a hand
There go God’s work again, how’d he know I need that?
How the fuck did he pick her to walk me through a relapse?
Believe me, shorty I’ll kill for you if need be
And I need you much more than you would ever think you need me
What I do for you is tangible, shit that you can gain
You for me, not understandable, it's shit I can’t explain
Some folk don’t see the effect in that
Some say I’m using you, they’d be correct in that
But what for they’ll never know
It’s deeper than nude pics, it’s something I would never show

I figured like this
You came to me at a pool party and I was two steps away from smoking on that wet
My logic say to me, you came to me as a stranger and I hold you dearer than most people I ever met in my entire life, b
God’s work, not mine
You came younger and wiser, I'd have never known it
You don’t look your age
Younger and wiser when I was older and dumber
You came to me as nothing I'd have ever wanted
But everything I'd have ever needed, I swear to you its God's work, not mine

So you'll never be alone again
What's mine is yours, you won't be without a home again
And I know you from Miami, so you hate the cold
But you been through much colder than me and I'm much older
You just ride shotgun, let a nigga chauffeur
I'll cut the grass, you just look out for the cobras
We'll be just fine, God set these on our shoulders
I'll show you a man, you showed me I could stay sober
Let the world talk about every picture we post up
And we'll sleep well every night, cause they don't know us

I give you my all
But it seems like that's not enough
Letting you get more of me
So while the world keep on changing
The one thing remaining is
I keep letting you get more of me

God's work
Talk to em
Sometimes you gotta stick around for the miracle
Gotta wait for the miracle to happen
God's work, not mine

I said, God's work, not
Word, I love you
I'm gone
Life is beautiful ain't it...",More of Me,2013
Joe Budden,"Some things need to be said
So why don't I say it
I'll only say this one time
Just once,
Just listen
Check this

My castle started shrinking, something's gotta give
Ended up being the smallest place that I had ever lived
One of the reasons I would do away with fame, to say the least
Don't know who these people are, their names ain't on the lease
It's a different type of monster, entertainment is a beast
Was supposed to eat together, then I became the main feast
If you preying on my kindness, taking advantage of Joe's cool
I'd have to ask, what's your definition of soul food?
I bust my ass for my whole life, and I worked hard for my profit
And envy I know cuts like a knife, so you probably work hard to stop it
If you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic?
You know I cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket
A pretty good judge of character, maybe I mistaked a few
Cut some people off, but had no choice, it's what they made me do
Why would you take advantage when it's something I'd have gave to you?
And in the long run, it doesn't take from me, it takes from you
You'll probably tell me I'm a fucked up nigga
You got it wrong, I just won't be fucked up with you
Which forces me to get distant, and I never want to act a way with you
But passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical
No longer enable you, that's no longer favourable
But pride is on your sleeve, so you'll just act like nothing phases you
Which can never equal good, in fact
So love can't be lost, I know exactly where I put it at

Word. Got no problem with nobody though
So have no problem with me. Figured
It's no beef, no malice.
I got no vendetta with y'all
So I only want better for myself
Might even want better for y'all

My castle started shrinking, I tried my best to fight it
Don't know how it happened, don't know how they got invited
Was good with cabin fever, and maybe that helped create the space
Fuck your good intentions, more concerned with what's taking place
But everyone feels entitled, made up their mind they got a right to
My peers transforming right before my eyes into my rivals
Y'all can have the cars, y'all can have the clothes, take all that shit that I don't love
I'm learning fast that recognition is its own drug
And what's worse than some of your actions being feminine
Is I got no way of knowing if your moves are really genuine
You there when it's right, better be there when it's dark
You wasn't there for the ride, don't be there when I park
Figure I love niggas enough to let the world come and stay with me
And I'll stay trapped in this room to keep y'all away from me
What's supposed to happen when I'm not hot anymore?
Your job rely on me being crazy, but what if I'm not anymore?
The funny shit, them molly's were cool when we all were doing 'em
But nobody recalled when I was the only one they were ruining
I learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair
So No Love Lost, but not much is there
Deja vu, this happened rapidly before
Everyday's a constant struggle and you're a casualty of war
Which could only equal good, in fact
So love isn't lost, I know exactly where I put it at",Castles,2013
Joe Budden,"Always had big dreams
Everybody had big dreams though
I never wanna stay here, I had no intentions
And I have had no plans

Live my life
Gotta know how to survive
Just can't hide
These streets eat you alive
Ghetto burbs
Cause I'm from two different worlds
Ghetto burbs
Comin' from the ghetto burbs

Yo yo, ghetto burbs I'm from the ghetto with Jerz
From where the pedal is served
Use hand, justice for words
Big up to LA, they was ahead of the curb
My hood we gang bang
You could get left on the curb
Yea I was raised here, but I'm tryna export
Police is crook yea, the strippers is escorts
Like my homey Layla, really I can't knock her
'Cause she getting paper, month ago she was knocked up
Baby daddy a dope boy, fresh homey was locked up
But he on the same shit, fucked around and got shot up
In my same mind, I'm like why he even bother?
At the same time don't know what he was a part of
And Layla over the casket, tears coming harder
The hood wins again, another son with no father
Gotta take it in stride, 'round here that's the usual
But I ain't accustomed, that shit I can't get used to
I'm trying to survive

Ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jerz'
From where the ghetto's disturbed, you can be dead in a hearse
Say a prayer daily and end it with ""better or worse""
I lost faith, but grandma still keep her head up in church
Murder rate sky-high, employment is real low
Little kid try to rap, but will he get a deal? No
'Cause poverty kills slow, belief is beyond you
7 out of ever 10 bitches here got the monster
Like my little homie Tanya, I met her at Freaknik
Freak shit, the same bitch them niggas be all out in the street with
Open, in love with the service
But she got resentments you won't see from the surface
Feel like so many women look great, so she worship
Caught AIDS from rape, thought her whole life was worthless
Ho couldn't know how gorgeous her curves is
She fucking 'em raw and hope to catch it on purpose
You better survive

Gotta know how to survive

Comin' from these ghetto burbs

Ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jerz'
I ain't tryin' to act like my part of the ghetto's the worst
Niggas is tricks here, they'll buy stilettos for birds
How did I get here? They act like the metal don't hurt
You just getting high, guess they trying to escape it
Or commit suicide assuming they couldn't take it
The streets is cold, still we run around naked
Success is a void and we replace it with hatred
That's your homie from way back, from so many years old
But friends turn green, even that acted weird old
You think he cared? No, y'all used to share clothes
Now you struggle for rent and he got ice in his earlobes
Your man won't even extend a hand, meeting all his career goals
You need a whole 'nother plan, your career's froze
Valuables are more valuable
Than everything even value to dude
Cause you gotta survive

These niggas lied to me way back,
Said this was where my buck stop
Ridin' right by in my fly shit
These niggas still at that bus stop,
You'll never see these jeans sag
You would think so with this tucked Glock
And any nigga wanna go bar-for-bar
Know I’m always with that club hop
This your shit, y’all don’t know shit
Them hoes you with is just average
This four spittin’ that whole clip and my alibi is my bad bitch
So don’t be the first to get it
My life is like a movie and your bitch deserve the credit
I just stood there and directed
She just did what I expected
Doin’ me but you'd do me too
I’ll be me, my nigga, you be you
I guess that men can be groupies too
Recognize a winner, live like a born sinner
Catered dinners, finna have a pool party in the winter
Finna skinny dip bitch fuck them drawers,
Her brains are killer and I love em' all,
Said my head got a price on it,
She come through and just suck it off,
So if you scared get a weapon
Every day a nigga live like he prepared for Armageddon

Now when they call me to them gates and they ask me how I live
I feel I ain’t have a choice like my stomach’s to my ribs
Niggas wanted me dead, I kept hammers in the crib
But nah, I don’t regret a fuckin’ thing I ever did
So I spend like it’s my last day

Shooters on my team
Choppers with the beam
Countin’ up some green
Blowin’ on a blue dream
My life is like a movie and your bitch just made a scene
Me and your bitch just made a scene
Wake up and I smoke somethin’
After that, I poke somethin’
Bet she bad with a fat ass
Beat it up like she stole somethin’
Fuck two times then I roll somethin’
Can’t no nigga do it like me
All my chains is icy
All my clothes is pricey
In Louis Vuittons, no Nike's
I’m Nino Brown, you Ice-T
Snitchin’ equals dead bodies
(Snitchin’ equals dead bodies)
Nigga caught a death wish, think he caught me slippin’
I don’t play that bull, boy
I'm shootin' like Scottie Pippen

I lace my H’s, walk free

Ninety-three is my horse fee
Life’s a bitch I figured I’d bone
Smoke this weed while I get a little dome
Black star when it’s all said and done
Gotta put my name in the middle of the road
Open boxes, a pair a day
Mine don’t come in pearl yet
Got a party out in the UK
I’mma hit them hoes with my Euro step
Insomniac, gotta live my life
Where’s the pie? Gotta get my slice
I hommie shit, where’s the body bag?
Kiss my Maserati ass
Two thick queens in a king’s suite
Gettin’ energized off thin sleep
I let all my AKA's hit
They thought I was ten deep
Miss wake me, get a hundred dollar tip
Pray to God, heard my number and I hit

When you do good, all the summers go quick

Joe Budden,"The alternate route is a long one
But ultimately, in the end, it gets you to the same exact destination
Yes sir, the journey's been long
And the wins have been short
But today, none of that matters

The time is now, zoom, get close
The ego is gone, the room is for growth
But talent is there, the feeling is new
I mean, bottom is gone but the ceiling is too
I was higher than Whitney, headed toward the top again
Everything I write crack, like its with a Bobby pen
But it's more than what you hear in a song
The wings are extended, the fear is gone
Hold up, the clips are loaded, safety is off
The business is in the black, I ain't taking a loss
Hold up, standards are high, hoes never hold out
The touring is cool, the shows always sold out
The foes are mad, but fuck it no one else cares
The kicks are custom, you'll never see 'em elsewhere
The stakes are high, the risk is crucial
And they love to hate me, but I love it when they do too

I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time

Look, I've been hurt, I could pull up scars
Now the earth is my pull up bar
The journey was long, the roads were slim
Though I thank God today, I probably owe it to sin
Streets were hungry, I was torn apart
Even though them jails were cold, they warmed my heart
Was living the worst, but prayed for the best
Ain't have a thing given to me, had to rape success
Had to be used for approval, had to use whatever was useful
Had to act old even when youthful
Money don't make me, that ain't what I kill for
'Cause I was richer than I'd ever been, and was still poor
Some never thought he would propel
Some talked to me just to speak to themselves
Some broke their arm, all while reaching for wealth
So when you come into the game, make sure you leave with yourself, Joey

Gotta take what's mine

Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time

We all got demons, a few I rivalled
Looked 'em in the eye, and they became suicidal
They thought it couldn't happen, they were too prideful
His head's an ornament on the wall as proof I survived you
Bills were high, money was low
Strip club was popping, wasn't money to go
Going nowhere fast, but drugs was a one stop
Couldn't shine selling that tan, I had my son blocked
Now I'm on acres, in a house, with a loft
The women are foreign, their blouses are off
It's a whole new me, I redefined my style
And since yesterday's gone, I guess the time is now

Made a lot of mishaps, lot of mistakes, lot of missteps
Grown shit though, is when you can recognize that
And I recognize that, and real recognize that
Talk to 'em

Last word, check it, unbeatable force, insurmountable object
Bull should've known better than counting me out, I'm from the projects
So if I ever do it for greed, indeed something is wrong
Prepare for the future, remember I used to get heat from the oven on
They wanted to see Budden gone, fiend'd out on sour
But nobody helped put Budden on, had to bring my own power so
I'm having a private party, that only myself attends
And if the DJ plays the song to my soul, it'll give itself a cleanse
They telling me all the pain I ever felt was self-infringed
But I had help from friends, one even held the syringe
Architect of my own path, I'd like to think it's designed the best
Defied the odds, I never aged while giving time a test
No niggas on house arrest, I'm on a minor rest
You trying to call me or text me, don't even bother, I'm trying to give mine a rest
I got a treasure but its content is invisible
Was filled before with shit that I thought I treasured, but made me miserable
My affairs together, here forever, yeah I'm back to work
Learned in order to lose love, probably gotta have it first

My life's a crap shoot, my dice are loaded, ain't no stopping me
Most interesting man, a hard place is between a rock and me
I'm torn within, and my eyes are heavy
I'm born again, just means I died already
Means I survived already, so fuck they want with me?
World been against me so long, misery hates my company
Isolated my whole life, not many know who Joseph is
In order to reciprocate love, you gotta notice it
Gotta recognize it, gotta feel it first
Gotta be let inside it, feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
If you contain it, don't hide it, gotta reveal it first
And when you think you hit rock bottom, gotta feel it worse
Or, my rule book is just dated
And for you to truly appreciate it, you gotta at least be hated
Mama I made it, if anyone know my way was hard
They prayed for my downfall on deaf ears, I was praying to God
So God, I loved love till it resented me
And if it's still a stranger, then I love who it pretends to be

No love lost
No love found
They found a little bit though
I don't know where they found it out, but it was there
So I guess the moral of the story,
Is as you mature, so will it
Just gotta find it

The courage to change the things I can

Joe Budden,"I said all that I'll say, so I stand with no apologies
I've popped all that I popped, wasn't too recently that it got to me
Those of y'all that love Joe, gotta admit the shit was a lot to see
Today I take all of the credit like I did away with modesty
I lost weight, lost faith, I got caught up in that vacuum
My stomach turned and my eyes burned, and I became best friends with the bathroom
Today it takes all the strength I have inside for me to avoid the rush
Face pokered over the toilet, all you hear is a royal flush
Was under control, though they warned me about addiction
Mind manifested again in the form of a prescription
And it's funny what the effects of that little pill'll do
Funny shit that keeps you alive can also kill you
But it's my life, guess I'm stuck in it
Sometimes I wanna just be normal like them other kids
The demon I battle with every night is simply drugs and shit
But I'll runaway from it all if God deems that I've had enough of it

They say don't get lost, follower the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside and
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here, yeah

Uh, it go
How come they can roll? Y'all tell me how come they can smoke, they can drink?
They get to do whatever they want and it don't interrupt the way they think
They all get to be regular, why is it only me this odd?
Me who can't even stand up straight, me who can't even keep a job
Maybe I'm asking for too much, a tiny piece of normalcy
Or an answer to any one of my fucking prayers that's asking what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm tired of being unique, tired of being that outcast
I'm tired of me being the only one, so tired of you all not knowing about that
I'm tired of it all, want me to fall a spectacle, for the crowd to see
Or being the only one with faith, I'm tired of everybody doubting me
I'm tired of responding to grown ass folks that think so motha fuckin childishly
Aches, wish I could take my parents' genes the fuck up out of me
Tired of wanting to run somewhere, tired of having to bare it all
Tired of you fucks constantly taking from me and I'm willing to share it all
Tired of being objective, I'm tired of having to hear it all
But being alone is the only way I know to never be near it all

They say don't get lost, follower the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside and
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here, yeah",Runaway,2013

I can take you all over the world though, even tell you pack light
The last lad couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, it’s my turn, that shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick, uh
And I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why, it ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear, how could other women compare
They can’t

Bitch, I miss you like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing, ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test
You be fucking that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga, he can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me and I know ya still for me
That’s why we still fucking, cause she don’t put it down like you

She don’t put it down like you

Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you

Love being ’round mine, no downtime, still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall, 'cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off, like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Said she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her, making likes of hers, no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to desperate
Climb with the former rather ladder, you already know which one I’d rather

And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's coming from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin' from, a somethin' that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleedin' out his lungs and spittin'
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
'Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen,
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and that thunder hitting
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin'
So not a chef but the cocaine forever cookin'
I love kids but now I' selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand,
Gun on my waist and, ""I don't give a fuck"" is my plan.
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing

Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it

Fuck all that rapping, I'mma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop it? Make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'mma take a shot
And Hope the stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yeah thanks a lot, I'm a bottle drinkin' nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleanin’ these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon cause you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That’s when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I’s youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

I thought I had it locked away till forever
But no memories fade away, they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then why's the pain still with me?

See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there’s no remorse
Maybe the lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus all
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that’s my department
Intercity blues cruise and I’m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ain’t in my closet, that’s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me
Tell my Pop I ain’t bothered when he don't speak to me, I love you but it’s weak to me
On one hand life is short and there’s no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, I’m kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don’t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, though I'm under-manned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

Some took advantage of you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you, must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it

So if she comes with baggage it's a carry-on
So in life without her, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave,
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered them words I damn near couldn't breathe

Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make it bittersweet, today that shit mad as none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, less started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you so it's ill how you believe in it
'Cause you done dated a few
If I'm a take a chance on love

(My brothers I keep 'em close and I'mma keep on keepin')

This shit done left music, we just fam now
Man I done brought niggas around who give a fuck 'bout rhyming
Gave 'em that look so y'all don't know but that's your man now
My shooters is yours, extra hands out
But not a hand-out
Nickle, you had me feelin' fly up in the No Fly
Walkin' through that Motorcity Inn like I was multi
Goons on both sides, somebody sneeze that nigga daddy wear a bow tie
And Crook, I'm always comfortable on your side
Sauce you a Boss, Horseshoe what it do?
C-Style hold ya head, Tray Deee can’t wait to meet you
And Jumpoff, when that whole shit jumped off, I ain’t gon name no names
But yeah I hoped that I ain’t come off grimy but dawgs I fuck wit them niggas that’s why I never threw my gloves on
Needed to clear that up ‘cause that shit been really botherin’ me for dumb long
A nigga say something I’ll run in that nigga’s mouth
To everybody you Budden, to me you my nigga Mouse

Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
(My brothers I keep 'em close and I'mma keep on keepin')

Ring the alarm, we set the world on fire, oh yo!
Chemistry you never seen before
We the four, Well-known plus worth knowing you niggas either or
Even if we was poor never seen a tour
And Eminem didn’t put our CD in a convenience store anymore
We can still hit the streets and score
I help us finance our dreams on a triple beam
Never bicker for simple things
Loyalty is royalty with these Shady royalties
I will loyally help you pay all your lawyer fees
It’s much deeper than the art of rap
It’s realer than me signing a few autographs
Rocking my new slaughter tats
I was raised to keep it G since snap Starter hats
And bury our enemies like artifacts these are the facts
Like Chinese food in the fridge we a cold combination
Slaughter slaughter my whole conversation

Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
(My brothers I keep 'em close and I'mma keep on keepin')

I'mma be mad cold and I’m cut this way, no matter where I’m at
It’ll be black roses on Mother’s day, on they mama front door mat
You know I'm, I’m quick to jump in front of fire in the line of fire
You ain’t got to ask what side I’m on I’m going homicide
May I simply cease to exist if I should be a bitch
If you should die and I should stay behind we actually a switch
As far as passing you a chick, you get the alley-oop you ask for the assist
This is a fact, it’s more than rap to me it's
More serious than holding a loaded gat to me I sold my soul to a bottle of Patron
And my favorite uncle died of an illness alchy related then he stole it back from me
And now he up in heaven like neph, you owe it back to me
I was taught that too much talking will make you fall faster
My actions show that I’m real I ain’t got to broadcast it
I called you and said that I had to fall back I had to recover
And here we are, that’s for my brothers

Look, the love I got for ya’ll goes unsaid
Was there when me and shorty unwed
For that I’m always down to pump lead
We formed a bond against the cowards
Only grew over time in the studio for hours
And tours with no showers, and towns I never heard of was no small fort
But we was all sports, Slaughterhouse t-shirts in our ball shorts
Quick all that other shit, that's just other shit
Love is love, we ain't even gotta discuss this shit
The part that's sick G?
My brothers love me so much, I think their punch hit ya’ll harder than it hit me
Four of the best in the world, I put a M on it
And if that ain't enough I’m putting Em on it
We back to hogtying beats up and stepping on it
Back on our old shit just like Nino Bless is on it
Crowds screaming, the fans can get excited
And oh, as far as that question? I won't even dignify it

Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?

Joe Budden,"We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate, from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone

I mean we started with love, the beginning was magical
Then it ended abrupt, how's it us that this happened to?
Was it all just a lie? How was none of it factual?
Even in our demise, it seems I'm always attached to you
They said if you let it go, if it's real it comes back to you
She just called me a thief, I took it, never gave back to you
After all that I've done, figured you'd have some gratitude
Look how far we fell off, we can't even be casual
Guess we both had times we were being irrational
We both out of our minds, how are we not compatible?
Say I pushed you out the door, and you did what you had to do
Now you play the victim like I wasn't impacted too
Should be a movie star, ma, you so good at acting new
You like us as strangers, me, I think it's impractical

But she said that she deserves much better for as long as she fought
Guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought
We'll never know, come on

We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate, from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I mean we started with love, then we ended with hatred
The whole world in our business, clearly nothing was sacred
I know you down to your core, unless for years you just faked it
I know all of your flaws, see your soul when you naked
Now you got a new squad, all them bitches is basic
And even if they ain't, it ain't hard to mistake it
I think you running from love with me, you gotta face it
Are you guarding your heart from a nigga that always breaks it?
Now you live in the club, maybe you tryna stay busy
You still call me every birthday to say that you miss me
You check to see who I'm with, did anybody come after
But still talk like you the one, say none of them matter
I guess it is what it is, what about what it could be?
Do we try this again just to confirm what it should be

But she said that she deserves much better for as long as she fought
I guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought
We'll never know, come on

We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate, from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh

I'm the one you hide
The one you can't forget
And you're the reason why
I lie awake in bed
You never felt so open
I never been so scared to death
We pushed so hard
'Til there was nothing left
Under my skin, gave what I had to give
We hit the end

We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate, from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We broke like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh

Joe Budden,"Just gotta get these thoughts off real quick
See I'm a thinker, it's like thinking shit
It's when you got
You sittin' there reflectin', thinkin' shit
I peep it though

Look, you liked me better before you knew my history
Before you knew who I was
That's when reachin' our potential felt likely
Nobody like me
Besides see if I stop bein' who I am
I'm straight to it, who I might be
But you gotta look inside each song
That's where I proved it was really in sight all along
Bear it all so the privacy gone
Grab the pen, sit down and write these wrongs
Just how I right these wrongs, but look
You liked me better when I spoke usin' censorship
Before you knew I was really insensitive
That was back when it was you and me
Then curiosity killed you, you had to Google me
Now I won't call the headlines a liar
Some are true and some are false, that's for y'all to decipher
But look, on rare occasions some of what they say'll bother me
I liked it better when the 'Net was still a novelty
'Cause now people who ain't found themselves
Get an outlet, yet don't know how they sound themselves
They like me better when I'm silent and don't have an opinion
Pretendin' to blend in like I'm a minion
Say if Joe keep talkin' that shit, he'll get him shot
But if rappers can't tie my shoes, how can I not? (Shit)
Thought I had my city's support, I couldn't believe
Jersey City liked me better when I couldn't leave
I take it back, that ain't set in stone
They moreso had weapons drawn cause I left alone
I liked it better when I had nothin' to lose
The days when I felt like I had somethin' to prove
Shit, even for me that's unusual
If you don't give a fuck then who you gotta prove it to?
Just the world that I was born in
You gotta learn to form wins against the storm wind
They like me better when I fuckin' never call again
Without it, they don't know what type of box I belong up in
They like me better without reality television
Guess they didn't need to witness the hell I was livin'
In my shoes, you too would seal a fate
Poppin' twenty pills a day, somebody gon' feel a way, look
And so these hoes just to pass time
After the past time, they don't even pass my mind
You liked me better way before you got lied to
But that don't really matter when you want me inside you
Your friends sayin' leave, they don't know that you tried to
You can't speak to them, I'm the nigga you cry to
I liked it better when nobody ever heard of me
'Fore pop had to get that knee surgery
Guess that effected his bladder
So when Jackie called me nothin' else really mattered
Was scared, sounded frantic, I ain't want no parts of that
Said the ambulance came, might be a heart attack
Was leavin' work nearly cryin' on the phone
I'm in rush hour traffic, just seen you dyin' alone, look
I just pictured all the places that we never went
All the texts that were never sent
All the words we never spoke
Time we never shared, rewind so we can repair
Such an inspiration, all the holes that you dug through
Then you got released, God was watchin' above you
I'm thinkin' you healin', I don't wanna disrupt you
So I'm right back to never tellin' you that I love you
And I don't wanna act that way
If I take somethin' for granted, I don't wanna give it back that way
Forreal, that's how shit get lost, let me chill
I like it better when I'm not talkin' over my thoughts, now listen

I done been down, been down, it's all for you
Said it's all for you
And I don't wanna get in your way
And I don't wanna get in your way
Said this love is all for you
Said this love is all for you

Look, now the singers wanna rap, the rappers wanna sing
Personally I liked it better back when rappin' was a thing
'Cause now if you wanna get the high notes
When that hook come, you gotta hit the high notes
The label wanna sell singles
I'm sellin' a story and that'll just taint the message
Bad marriage, we ain't got the same objective
Still I'm here 'cause real niggas in the game respect it, look
They like me better when I let 'em live rent free
I never knew that once it stopped we'd be enemies
And though I come off as heartless, nigga
In spite of yourself, got love for you regardless, nigga
Now listen, I liked you better when you wasn't in the spotlight
Was too addicted to it, said some shit was not right
So when you work so much I couldn't complain
'Til I learnt she was gateway escapin' from the pain
The strippers talk to me like I'm their therapist
That scares the good girls away, don't know the hell I get
Whatever thoughts you contrive, I can't help you with
But you've been tossin' it for a year and I derail the shit
I'm self made, I don't do what I'm told
The type that needs free reign, to be out of control for real
'Cause when that's gone I'm lost, let me chill
I like it better when I'm not talkin' over my thoughts, word

I've done been down, been down, it's all for you
Said it's all for you
And I don't wanna get in your way
And I don't wanna get in your way
This love is all for you
This love is all for you ooh
Said this love is all for you",Love for You,2015
Joe Budden,"To my dear dearly departed
Shit's becomin' all that I feared, here's where it started
Seems that nothing's as it appears, swear it's retarded
No wonder I get speared by my peers, yeah I'm a target
It used to take a nation of millions for niggas not to be
Amerikkka's Most gave America hope
Back when the music had a message in it
We was rebels against it
The best was intended to lessen the gimmicks, but now
Y'all made a mess of it
And somebody gotta address this shit
Rakim would never wear a dress and shit
I ain't a pessimist to say I ain't impressed with it
Your hearing's bad, you think it's alive, now that's the death in it
When it was all about bars, wanted to weddin' it
Surround yourself with bullshit, you'll be liable to step in it
Came here with one objective, gettin' it further
Now I'm watchin' my first love die, witnessin' murder
When Common stopped lovin' ol' girl, what was he tellin' me?
Cold world, now she won't dig you without a melody
Love nerds, used to be into niggas with felonies
We need a new president, where the fuck is Eric B?
Or did my wordplay confuse her?
Now I see her with Young Thug and Future
Like what did you niggas do to her now
My generalization is this generation
The imminent state of this gentrification, desensitization
I call her, she's in Marvin's room, everything is awkward now
She moved more to south, deserted her New Yorker crowd
Met her with a cane, she changed, prefer to walk it out
Stopped eatin' meat when she heard I worked in a slaughterhouse
Now she's a new dame glued to the fame
She used to hate accessorizin', now she's wearin' two chains
Relationship too strained, I don't know who to blame
When I tell her, ""You've changed"", she say, ""Who would be the same""
She right, 'cause this ain't the way we knew each other
Or do I face the fact that maybe we outgrew each other?
It took a while, but that's finally understood
She wouldn't change if she could
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Everything has changed
I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Look, I can't get with you at all, our issue is tall
You tied to every nigga now that dribbles a ball
Did I miss a red flag? You wasn't fickle before
I can't even ridicule y'all, that'd be a bitter resolve
Wanna talk about our history
I feel like everything you say is contradictory
Whenever you come visit me
I look at you and see remembrance, remnants
Plenty resentments, it's not you but there's resemblance
We diss each other all out of fun, shit amuses me
You threaten every girl I'm with, that just confuses me
Say you want kids real soon, now that's abuse to me
And I just write about it in song
You're like a muse to me
I wanna ask where you see yourself in five years
How you goin' about that, like what's the verdict?
I wanna ask if you ever replay the past over
And if you do, when you finished is it worth it?
I wanna ask if we love each other so much
How do we cause each other so much pain?
Still in all in each others lives
We've remained without a claim
I know some'll call that clinically insane
How do we remedy the games?
Was once enemies and then that energy refrained
Wasn't meant to be, the synergy had us mentally drained
Minimally sprained so relentlessly he aims
Despite when you said you never could depend on me again oh
Still we're here as none of this had ever taken place
Are we checkin' to see if someone's takin' our place?
As we front like we're takin' up space
I think currently the current we is makin' our case
But for what? Would that just seal it again
Did it all hurt so much? Do we wanna feel it again? I doubt it
Took a while, still nothing's understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Everything has changed
I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Look, I can see the pain in your eyes, I wanna fix it
But all your words are fuelin' my pride, so I'm dismissive
You think I wanna sit in this courtroom
Talkin' supervised, scrutinized by suit and ties? You a lie
You could cry, the conditions of you and I, can't escape it
Every lie she told you over the years, I'm face to face with
And now they manifested
You're overwhelmed and congested
But feelin' neglected, I gotta respect it
I can't explain to your so young brain
Since our first exchange you've been kept from me
Used against as weaponry
And as much as I hate her
I'd never downplay your mother like that
For you to judge her like that
Just a lesson later on that you'll discover like that
We not alone in this process, no, it's others like that
But you spew these sly remarks like
""Why are we here? Like why are you near?
Like why do you care how I dispair?""
I gotta eat that, see you got a grudge, lil' nigga
We flesh and blood, lil' nigga, no ifs, ands or buts, lil' nigga
You can think your dad is nuts, lil' nigga
I'm talkin' to you 'cause you came out of my nuts, lil' nigga
That's my stance on the matter, I won't budge, lil' nigga
And I'll tell that to your mother and the judge, lil' nigga
At our next court date, you gon' see that it's true
Funny, my condescendin' ways, I kinda see 'em in you
Mannerisms when I'm annoyed, yep I'm seein' that too
I'm smilin', admirin' genes, I kinda think that it's cute
I was you twenty years ago when pop popped up
But nothin' like you, sad how life'll recycle a cycle
You missin' intel only a dad can give
Can't expect you to understand
This doesn't matter to a kid and since
Our situation's not understood
I would fix it if I could
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Everything has changed
I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?

Another collar, another dollar
Life's short but we live it cause we gotta
Another day, another blessing for a scholar
School of Hard Knocks, just reppin' my alma mater
That was back when I ain't have shit
God on my shoulder with the Devil on the ad-libs
Had to think some decisions through
When times hard, who the fuck you gon' listen to?
Toilet by the bunk, put you in a different mood
Locked up, Thanksgiving eatin' prison food
Back on the ropes, won't see a nigga budge
No bail for a felon so you gotta see the judge
They used to call us all lost niggas
Had the same dreams to make it 'til we lost niggas
Some was married to the game, I divorced quicker
But I can't judge, one day I'll see the lord with you

Note from the marshall, you can't even borrow
And it's sad cause they comin' with the padlock tomorrow
And for you to blame the world, gotta blame yourself too
'Cause everybody feel you but nobody can help you
Bad thought get in your head, then you loop it
Stress build up then you do somethin' stupid
Put a mountain in front of you, you just try to move it
Count on one hand the couple niggas you cool with
Either they ain't pickin' up or they ain't got it
You learn the hard way when your actions are idiotic
Product of your environment, and you're the product
Home invasions, niggas is gettin' tied up
This is goin' through your head while you're in the bullpen
Backed into the spot but you should've pulled in
First nigga move and you're on him
But you're really prayin' for a ROR in the morning

They say tomorrow ain't promised, most nights I ain't want it to be
Nah a nigga couldn't front it to me
Too many nights for dinner I just ate an uncomfortable sleep
Had to open up the oven for heat
I was a born loser, thoughts of a sinner
Only made it out cause I fought like a winner
Threats all my life, I'm good, was all talk though
Death around the corner, all you gotta do is walk slow
Land of the haves and have-nots
Gun tucked, better to have it than to not
Try to make it out but crabs are in the lot
That'll plot, so if you take a stab you'll get shot
Look, I'm just proof a couple niggas said a prayer for me
Wasn't fair for me, God had to bear with me
Nothin' to live for, didn't have a care with me
Suicidal, had my mama sheddin' tears for me
'Cause my son might need me
Life is hard but dyin' is easy
I thank God every day that I awake
I avoid another funeral, a homi' or a wake
I escape from niggas that lived through it
Better days ahead, we just gotta get to it

Okay the wait's up, waited up, really don't know where to start
Niggas fresh home want me dead and gone, I'm darin' y'all
It's in arms reach when I'm sleep, I'm prepared for y'all
Niggas bleed, BIG agrees, ain't nobody scared of y'all
Besides, let me summarize, they ain't got to wherewithal
I'm every where, they never there, when I'm gon' hear from y'all?
Y'all know me as Joe, don't wanna see me as Mouse
Let me address all these rumors so they don't leave out the house
I mean it started with Clue, that's when the bullshit begun
I was the best in my city, niggas knew I was the one
Ain't have a dime to my name, still niggas thought that I won
And niggas that never did it want to tell me how it was done
I'm hearin' some wanna clap, they don't fuck with me, nigga
They say I never go back, well that's a luxury, nigga
It's somethin' I can afford, so what they say get ignored
They pray I'm on the wrong end of that Ford

They want me man down
They want me man down

Okay let's start it from scratch, put it all online
My character's been defamed, I put it all online
Told 'em that's where we were headed, said I was wrong all the time
And now we finally here, I waited a long ass time
Been called every name in the book, been a liar, a deceiver
A cheater, a woman beater, am I all, am I neither?
Been absorbin' the ether, robbin' Paul to pay Peter
High price to pay to strangers I been offering me to
I've been more than a leader, even with my back to the wall
Thought I was finished forever when I was practicin' falls
Now you second guessin' yourself, you gotta ask what you saw
They fishin', wishin' it's fiction, but ain't no actin' at all
Can't even fathom the gall, they mad I'm appalled
Too much passion to call, nothin' but bars, ain't no fashion involved
How is path ain't adored
How the fuck they laughin', I can blast through the door
Ain't fathom havin' so much cash in the drawer
First they love me and then they hate me, then they love me again
First it's lovely and then it's ugly, then it's fuck me again
Bitches don't text back and then they suck me again
But still it's none of my business what they think of me again
When we talk about skill, they just love me again
I call 'em out for the kill, they just duck me again
But I was born for the storm, I mean abnormal's the norm
Maybe they wanna know how long will they mourn

They want me man down
They want me man down

I'm wishin' this was a dream, maybe it's smoke in this mirror
Wish I could change it all just by blowin' smoke in the mirror
Been such a long ride, wishin' I was on the side
To get caffeine pills to stay awake with Sean Price
If I was by Eric Garner, I'd have yelled at the pigs
Gave him all my cash, he wouldn't have to sell that cig
Shout to Bobbi Kristina, let her know that I love her
Wish she was alive or didn't die the same as her mother
Maybe my thinkin' is off, when I blink I get thoughts
Of bullets shakin' the door, and tape around Chinx' Porsche
See it damaged my heart, I'd be right in Yams' car
To get the purp out his cup, and get his hands off the bar
Tell Stack that I miss him, see we losin' a lot
I wanna hear from Shakir, I still miss Stuart Scott
Chris Lighty, Robin Williams still to this day
I pray nobody ever feel that way, too many men die

Uhh
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Talk to 'em (Talk to 'em)

I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
I'm holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay, a change of scenery
But mama said wherever I'mma go, I'm taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and it's been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup, she don't believe in me
It's not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating, in a crowd I feel alone, mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily, that was never mentioned to me
She told me there's a higher power and a lower power
And that I'll die if I don't find the strength to overpower
Then I replied, ""well aren't we all""?
She said ""yeah, but that should be on God's terms, not yours""

My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me
But He tells me I'm only human
And that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me
But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me I'm only human

Tryin' to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
It's been beside me all along, not the song
I wanna sit in silence, don't speak for a minute
Tired of being strong, please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs, worse
Can't be depression, couldn't have it this long
So many secrets I only told through a glass of Patron, my nigga
Speaking of secrets, that's when I got the Kaylintext
Read it and cried, couldn't believe what she was saying next
She said ""you're going through a lot
I'm hoping you ain't in the grave and dead
'Cause not too many people know your brain's a mess""
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all?
I wrote back ""lol"" but wasn't laughing at all
I ain't tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand, and I was writing a note
Didn't get far, as soon as I wrote down ""mom"" I just stopped
Couldn't lie to her, couldn't figure out how to say bye to her
Couldn't explain the ""why"" to her
Couldn't picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me, 'bout God's grace and mercy
He ain't even say goodbye, he said ""let us pray""
And then he went into a prayer, gripped the phone, closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt, this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck, will you just quack?
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck, way in the back
'Cause when I had that burner ready to bust, I didn't clap
Joe

My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me
But He tells me I'm only human
And that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me
But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me I'm only human

Guess I'm insanity's definition
Trying to step over in sanity's repetition
But I can't it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back, we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep, eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me, I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle, beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous, must've thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing, thought it was funny
Giselle's the homie, Alexa's twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldn't dick her at all
I'm guessing, maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months, yet you said this was a new me
In your head, guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous, B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy, this was 'bout respect
Y'all Instagramming pictures, trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didn't connect, but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now I'm fucking homeboy up, just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But he's a young nigga, that's no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago, you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news, I'm being falsely accused
And I don't understand, was this all part of a plan?
I guess I'll tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house?
Now they got a search warrant, just to come to my house
Question, were your feelings worth taking my tomorrow's, kid?
And you know Jersey gun laws, I'm talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine, this is a big waste of time
Let's get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what, cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me, but I'm the villain, over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check, you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
'Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts, but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine, there's a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime there's a pole in the bar centered
So even though it's from afar now
I still wish you the best, I know your heart's tender
I'm sorry all, I just got my own scars to tend to
Signing off, truly yours, with love, God's sinner

My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me
But He tells me I'm only human
And that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me
But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me I'm only human

My every thought is scary

Joe Budden,"Yeah, yeah
Look, it was around '99
Baby comin' while I was at rock bottom
Ironic shit, I was listenin' to ""Rock Bottom""
Pockets rabbit ears, no paper, lot of cotton
Had some charges stemmin' from me and my squad robbin'
Had to leave the hood, shit stayin', not an option
I bumped your shit forever, felt we had a lot in common
A rapper expressin' wit who spoke in depressive stints
All that introspectiveness, I couldn't measure what it did
Listen, I'm writin' to you now 'cause we don't get to talk much
'Cept for in the stu' when we be passin' through the halls and such
I wonder if you catch me stare at you in awe much
And we be busy workin' so I never share my thoughts much
Remember signin' four niggas with an attitude?
Well maybe we'll get your star power and his magnitude
All I thought was it was 'bout to be on
But I never guessed that I was 'bout to be wrong
We encountered some things, maybe we should've figured out all along
Who the fuck was I to be too vocal in my doubt for some songs?
Even I can't be that dumb to step over the threshold
And be the guy who says no to so many records sold
Whole career, I never bit my tongue, I let it go
Too many times bein' the rebel, ain't end in what's best for Joe
That second album came and added truth to the slander
But we learned what's good for the goose ain't good for the gander
Guess I'm askin' for advice right now
Experience and leadership to help suffice right now
I guess I'm askin', ""How would you do it?""
Before I do somethin' too stupid
Before my group lose it just to get our views lucid
Every other day these niggas want a new exclusive
Should I be in the mix more? Maybe I'm too secluded
Do you think you'd be as famous now
If you had to put out ""My Name Is"" now?
The way the game is now, awful lyrics, shit is shameless now
Just tell me how you'd maneuver if you came in now
It's just thoughts, everything is criss-crossed
Gotta be cool with Complex and Pitchfork if I wanna get my shit off
These simpleminded niggas won't think you fuck with us
If they don't see you poppin' bottles in the club with us
It's about fashion now, which I hate
Because I dress like shit, I'm just the best when I spit
But different times, I was feelin' like the odd man out
Like I should leave, they'd be better with the odd man out
Like when I wasn't on that intro, I felt a little weird
But that was for the team, so I didn't really care, for real
For the team, how I happen to be
When Bad met Evil, nigga who was happier than me?
Think back, the way that I was on that shit
You woulda thought it was my album and I was on that shit
Like fuck rap, happy to see a friendship get mended
Cemented and any frivolous tension get ended
Joell you my G, Weapon Waist you my OG 'cause
Nickel you know I look at you like it's blood
Here's the flowers, before this end is covered with mud
We can disband right now and it's gonna always be love
For a brief period I tried to rhyme like y'all
I was high, maybe tryin' to prove that I'm like y'all
But I'm not, I suck at all that syllable shit
I'd rather make the pen bleed to see the feelin' you get
I'm bein' honest, we might never sell a million and shit
To me it's more value in keepin' it trill with my nigs
And to Em, one of the illest ever on the mic
We're less different than we are alike
This ain't about star power, I ain't on the hype
Never mind skin color, I see beyond the white
My whole life I fought trauma like you
Had ups and downs with my baby mama like you
I had my fair share of transgressions like you
Had a bad temper once and fought aggression like you
Did drugs, popped pills, fought depression like you
These are things you'd never pick up from our sessions in the stu'
I beefed with Hov, 50, Game and Wu
Got in my own way a lot, I'm sure the same as you
The whole label think I'm crazy, I been peeped it
I'm only mad I couldn't keep a better secret
Still when I hear your voice, my head goes wrong
Takes me back to that little boy with my headphones on
And the way you saved my life back then is how I'm savin' them
Plaques and charted tracks won't take me away from them
So I hope you understand
Fuck this record deal, you inspired me as a man
I'll cut it short, before I start feelin' like a Stan
Housegang for life, word to the pig on Royce's hand, uh
Success'll never disable me
No record label will ever label me
My morals ain't for sale, can't under-the-table me
I'll ride it out, even when everything ain't savory
My brothers love me, they won't enable me
And they won't kill me, they won't Cain and Abel me, uh
It’s how I feel at the moment",Slaughtermouse,2015
Joe Budden,"See I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Go ahead and judge me, I ain't gotta honor y'all

You can't con a con
Left from the long arm of the law

One life, so son live it
I'm committed, never did it and wish that I undid it

Ayyye, calling a bluff
I'm grown so I never think anything's more than it was like horrible bud
Never beefin' over these bitches cause it's more that I love
I ain't warring with cuz over what she's offering but
She got my hammer on rock, I'm like Thor in the club
While she semi off the Remy bitch got my dick all the way up

Now you judging me, they start some shit you got no proof of

For Rage to leave the cage like a lawless agent

Joe Budden,"It's easy, to forget
A joke or game, someone's name
The day to day, what time to meet
A certain place, or one street

Faces be looking familiar, sometimes it's hard to know
I've been in a whole lot of places, I've met a lot of folks
Ain't had a window to open, needed a pot to throw
In my hood the story of Mouse is one you gotta know
Could ask ma to push the i8 Beamer
Can't remember where I seen her, I think it was La Marina
Singing all the words to Trina
Whole demeanor said freak like old pictures of Adina
But now all these broads shaped the same and waist trained
I'm on my third passport, I can't remember these niggas
Like all the faces is blurred of most these industry niggas
Mean game somewhile for an inkling of the fame
And I can spot them from their accents when I'm thinking of their name
I've seen dames sip pink champagne
And do drugs that'll put Charlie Sheen to shame
Off my penis until I came
The drugs over these years made its way to my mental
Pardon if I don't remember when you gave me a demo
Or that one night we met up in Aces

Joe Budden,"Look, standing in the cypher rocking
To driving some of the hottest cars New Jersey's ever seen
To dropping some of the dopest mixtapes that you ever heard
And it's all courtesy of weed, a couple of Percs, and lean, baby
I wish you niggas that would owe me some bread would come and drop it off
I wish she start tongueing a girl, but she won't pop it off
Wish I knew you wasn't with the shit, so what you hopping for?
When pussy's thrown your way every nanosecond it's not an option ya'll
Normally a sponge, but this some shit I just cannot absorb
Why ya'll are dressed like Metro Boomin? I wish you would knock it off
Wish the best MC didn't mean who is more popular
But I just booked my next nine months, ready to lock and more

Money is a lot to grab
Before we get to it there's a question that I gotta ask
Where's all my niggas with the rubber grips? (bust shots)
And if you with me mama, I'm rubbin' ya tits, and whatnot

I hear they thinkin' bout speakin' my name
Bet if they could I'm takin bets
Money on my hood, money on me, I'm good
Money on the wood, money on wishin' that money would
That's him against the wild life
And I got money on the woods, baby
Two bitches, three's company, how I half with her
This Hennessy don't do the trick, then watch this Jack trip her
I'm tryna' buy a compound, I need the pad bigger
Thats seven bed rooms, eight and half baths, I figure
Bad strippers, and fraudulent hourglass figures
Got every bartender thinkin' she'll get a glass slipper
You see a line of bottles comin', guess who orderin' 'em
I'm pointin' at one, they all coming in

It's Joe",I Gotta Ask,2016
Joe Budden,"How's everybody feeling out there? We good?
Let's talk to the sample right quick
I always pictured we'd be
It go like this. Listen

Let me tell you how I pictured this
A few houses, a couple businesses
Striving for greatness, we would be each other's witnesses
And during beef, we both would put aside our differences
Where I ain't flinch a bit making you insignificant
Maybe kids and shit, perfect arithmetic
Meaning we could build our own world and co-exist in it
She a synergy, sharing energy
Let our souls mate in the air if you remember me
Now here's what I did with it
Went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks
Lost good girls making them mistresses
Just savages, missed marriages
They all was my babies, I needed those miscarriages
My worthless self when Joe felt hurt
I went out and targeted women who had no self worth
I relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work
When you can do it, but a stranger gotta go help first
I called moms on the phone, here's what I told her real quick
I said my 20s flew by with no control of the shit
Her next sentence swear that I’ll forever hold with a grip
She said it go by even faster as the older you get
I wanna never dumb down, I'd have to lower my wit
Ain't gotta post this on the Gram for you to know what it is
A partner to trust, I'm thinking even bigger for us
Mom should've told me this when we had shit to discuss
Now neither one of us is how we figured we’d be
Sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me
I always pictured we'd be

Nah'mean? That's how I see it in my head though
Ain't quite pan out like that. Word up
Let me tell you about some more of God's work though

I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know

Nah, I like it just like that, Parks, let it run
Lemme go right here, right here, right here
Look, Look

A love that's tideful, never prideful
If you're truly better without me how can I spite you?
As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had
Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad
We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown
I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home
So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there
Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there
I respect your mom's tutelage
But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this?
Watch and learn, foolish kid
Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am
I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am
Look, same pedigree, theoretically
Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically
One job in life to make you a much better me
Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be
You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs
I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong
Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded
Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit
Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it
My hands were in bondage, useless
Beyond the excuses, calm through it
It’s crazy, our bond music
And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit
So right now I stand in a place I never stood before
Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before
Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth
God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for
Now it's better than we pictured it'd be
And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it
Little nigga we'll be

This is greater than us. Greater than me
Greater than anything I could ever imagine, man
I ain't talking to everbody
Trey, what up though? What up? What up?

I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know
I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know",I Wanna Know,2016

When we ain’t know who was the nicest nigga in 3rd Base
Which emcee was the worst before my emcee search
Some niggas thought Pete Nice, me, I thought MC Serch
This before I ever met Em, way before ""Hammer Dance""
This when I was asking Carrie Anne to make me Hammer pants
Smooth B was dope, Greg Nice had character

I’m brewing from eyes that have seen through it
It’s no time for even a body to be reclusive
Execs'll feed you excuses, and if its seasoned, you chew it
We got old ideologies, I think we should renew it
The psychology for some of that reasoning’s even stupid
For me it’s deeper than music, much deeper than music
They stole our musical freedom, up next it’s freedom of music
As a tenth grade drop-out I’m watching the aftermath
Of everything streaming and doing the extremist

Hov was like the GOAT, congratulations on Tidal
Salute, you broke through many barriers for us
When we couldn’t move the needle you carried us for us
Look forward, maybe in 30 years they’ll implore us
Push to the back of the red ignore us
I think we nearing that border
Mr. Carter, who gon' fare for the authors?
They only there to extort us
Who gon be there to record us, nigga?
Even deeper who gon' care for our daughters?
And our sons just the vultures
We keep handing them the culture
And the hip-hop that raised this kid is one that spoke up
I’m pessimistic, I won’t even get my hopes us
But if it’s gon' all implode before it blow up
Need more than overcharging for what they did to the Cold Crush
Just a PSA in lieu of the movement
Can’t get a quarter back now, what about future music?
Really

So if I’m gone when tomorrow come
The mission for my only-born when tomorrow come
How will we receive songs when tomorrow come?
Here’s my study for understudies to borrow from
New Rage & Machine, nigga, we got this
Is what you hear when label ideas meet a plot twist
Used to be faded from the killer talk
Now we suffocating from the pillow talk
Every verse like, “damn, y’all love chivalry”
They offer me fame as a man, I chose dignity
Guess everything ain’t for everybody
Maybe everybody ain’t for everything
It ain’t a thing, I’m looking through my career
I’m more the long game dude on how I choose to prepare
Not the richest, just the sickest, ask the dudes in your tier
Knew if I made it to the top I’d hate the views from up there
We don’t value the same shit, I spoke through a despair
Stood out before it was cool to be weird, my nigga, you just appear
Before these niggas hit puberty
I was online talking like it’s just you and me
The foolery, but since we hopping like rabbits
Calling everything that’s dropping a classic
With all this modern day practice
Tactics that should rot in the ashes
Some are cut from the same cloth
Some have forgotten the fabric, listen
Raised a nigga that you rather leave at bay
She ain’t walking in naked, she ain’t fashionably late
Have her bring your good shoes so you can dodge around the rumors
In a suit that light the room up like Robert Downey Jr.’s
Fifth to the court tell I did this before

let me get back on my rage shit right quick though

I'm just taking back what's owed, and adding interest
Maybe just my love died, loud lit above high

Can't get to this type of flavor without a season at true
Every Sunday at the spades table slamming cards, hella hard
Spitting over Ruff Ryder or Roc-a-Fella bars
I'm telling stories of Khaled before he Terror Squad
Different from what they selling y'all, fuck am I telling y'all?
It's Uncle Joe, don't wear Supreme and jeans
Came up with Nitty and Web, I knew Supreme in Queens
And Ross dropped ""B.M.F."" and y'all would sing in the streets
I'm a little different, I was thinking of Meech
Check this shit
I used to drive around the tunnel in the Lexus with the snub
Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club
Listen, young niggas learn up, I don't do the kiddie shit
I'm with the turn up, I just like Biggie shit
Fuck is you saying?
Only been a sensation for only two generations
I'm like the minute the weigh in fight ready

And all them niggas I came up in the game with
Done fainted in the entertainment I swear

They say the older you get in life the faster it happens
Me, I feel like I could still fuck with 25 year olds 
And their mommas if they cute enough
So when I walk up in the day party and said,
""What up?"" all I hear is ""Uncle Joe"" in this bitch

Same way you know when you up, you better know when you slip
Studies based of years hanging with the boa constricts
I'm from an era where we ain't deal with all the trolling and shit
When we see you we just go in your shit
It's repercussions for actions, we demanded more
Don't understand it, dawg
Question all these niggas with words they never answer for
Staring at you new niggas still from an older state
It's feeling like Oscar Robertson watching Golden State
Y'all hear Post Malone and think of ""White Iverson""
I think of Karl and how he could've got the title won
I keep my life off Instagram like my private some
I open albums for the credits, y'all just Tidal 'em
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in here
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in this bitch
When there was problems with the game I got to sculpting that bitch
But they just kept talking about my hoes, I don't even notice the shit
I got a stash I never go in and shit
Same emotionless kids
Stoic as if I'm just a motionless gift
Normally in the club tucked in the corner, no one to mind me
You niggas go and look for these bitches, they come and find me
Y'all praise it, I be disgusted
Cause I don't want the points for scoring on easy buckets
(And what else?)
And I don't count her if she ain't alter my weekly budget
Or if she Snapchat every portion that we in public
That's awful, she need to cut it (she need to cut it)

The escorts fuck with me, that's a double entendre
Both got fat asses, one's a double cup monster
Both used to mad attention, it's my subtlety they fond of

I mean I pulled up to the block, swore I was never Neverland

Now the bitch depressed again, I don't need the stress again

I got shooters everywhere, where you gonna spend it at? murder

And sang to our hearts' content

You and the song are gone

About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.
J'ai besoin d'un bel animal
Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.

To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.

A moment of bliss we spent

Would be to capture me

But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie

To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares

In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,2009

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find

Haunts my reverie

You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Joe Carran,"Every night
I'm lying in bed,
Holdin' you close in my dreams;
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams.
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough;
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love.

Beautiful faces,
Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,
Wastin' our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

The same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above,
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love,
(You get the best of my love.)
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.
(You get the best of my love.)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream.
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Close enough so I can smell you.

I can't stand to burn too long.
Released in this sodomy.
For one sweet moment I am whole.

Won't you come just a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this.
I need this to make me whole.
There's release in this sodomy.
For I am your witness that
Blood and flesh can be trusted.
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind. 
Got your hands bound, your head down,
Your eyes closed.
You look so precious now. 
Show me something
Thought I could make it end
Thought I could wash the stains away
Thought I could break the circle if I
Slipped right into your skin
So sweet was your surrender
We have become one
I have become my terror
And you my precious lamb and martyr.

Joe Chindamo,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",Spetember Song,2004

But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

You took my heart and threw my heart away

Here

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

And enough love

For things I'm not guilty of
I was locked in a prison
Till you came and set me free
So how can you say
You're no good for me 
Now that the magic has gone
You just want to walk away
Nothing left to say, anyway
Now that the magic has gone
There's no sense in holding on
Baby now, now that the magic is gone 
You know love can be tender
Love can be cruel
It can smile like an angel
While it treats you just like a fool
it captures and haunts you
Until you give in
And it stats the dice against you
in a game you never can win
Just when I was thinking
Maybe luck was here with me
You're telling me it's over
Say it's time for breaking free 
Now that the magic has gone
You just want to walk away
Nothing left to say
Anyway baby
Now that magic has gone
There's no sense in holding on
Baby now
Now that the magic has gone 
I won't try to hold you down

There's no prices for the loser
Only the winner takes the purse

But to me it's just a curse

Or the innocent of mind
It's a full time job
For anyone to stay alive

The streets have shallow boundaries
For the war that's everyone
What a wasteland for
Broken dreams and hired guns

Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me

I've gone to sleep with one eye open
The other rolls my tears
In the darkness I can hide my heart
But none of my fears

In the morning like a soldier
I look closed up battleground
Another day, another [Incomprehensible] me
And the world goes round

Shelter me
Won't you shelter me?
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me

Won't you shelter me?
Oh, shelter me
When I lose control of my only home
Shelter me

Every time I tumble down
I wanna pack it up and leave this town
But when I finally get the nerve
Get cleared out of the shoes
I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you

Baby shelter me, please shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me

Won't you shelter me?
When I lose control of my only home
Shelter me

Won't you shelter me?
Oh, shelter me, baby please

Stay back and shelter me
Come on and shelter me
When I lose control of my only home

And the neon lights are shinin’ on my face

What a thrill, what a thrill, look at me, I’m the king

Joe Cocker,"We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more

The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, 'There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see.'
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be

One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree

Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean

Seemed to slip straight through my head

And when I do you'd better hide all the girls, I'm gonna

A flannel for my face
Pajamas, a hairbrush, new shoes and a case
I said to my reflection, ""You'll be out of this place""

Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings, memories of it still
Keep calling and calling but forget it all I know I will

Tempted but the truth is discovered

The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding, wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion, no story I could tell

At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer, I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction and I wish that it would stop

Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone, there's no other

A fortune all for you
But though it's not my conscience that hates to be untrue

Joe Cocker,"Jamaica was the lovely one, I played her well
As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell
Hiding from the children so they would not tell
We would stay there 'till her sister rang the evening bell
Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these empty hours
Say you will come again tomorrow
The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas
She would stare across the water from the trees
Last time he was home he held her on his knees
And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased
Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
And stay until my ships can find the sea
Jamaica was a sweet young one, I loved her true
She was a comfort and a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together, next thing I knew
We had brought her things down to the bay

Help me find a way to fill these sails
And we will sail until our waters have run dry",Jamaica Say You Will,1986

Take me home to the other side
",Take Me Home,1994
Joe Cocker,"Lost in the sound of the city like a shadow in the rain.
Memories come back to haunt me and I still feel the pain.
Some days are better than others but the nights remain. 
I sit and watch the dawn breaking and I whisper your name.
Angeline, you're living proof, it's not the way it seems.
Angeline now I can only hold you in my dreams.
Words left unspoken and hearts are broken in two shades of blue.
I should have seen it coming like a silent scream 
I felt a cold chill when I heard the message on the answering machine.
Angeline, the love I have for you still lingers on.
Angeline, you never know what you got till it's gone.
Angeline.
",Angeline,1994
Joe Cocker,"Nights are long
And the wind is howling down
Into the hollows
Somewhere deep inside
I can hear you calling out
Across the great divide

Right or wrong there's a feeling in my heart
I try to follow
But lately i just hide
And my dream of someday crawling out
To cross this great divide

Isolation
Heart like a drum
And the beating is wearing me down
Standing at the station
But the train never comes
Still I'm hanging on
Like some old ghost town

Miles to go but I see that one way out
Stars in the distance
Skies are open wide
Waiting for my soul to rise
Above this great divide

Desperation
Is a dangerous blade
In a reckless and trembling hand
Sweet salvation
Just a thin line away
I should cut and run
But I'll make my stand

Nights are long
But I'll close my eyes again
Until tomorrow
Slip the bonds and ride
Touch the face I long to see
Above this great divide
We'll be all We long to be
Beyound this great divide",The Great Divide,1994
Joe Cocker,"When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark

And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Give these loving arms a try baby
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
From a whisper start

And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you will see
I will catch your fall

Expecting nothing in return

You know time, time is our friend
I will hold you up, I will hold you up
Your love gives me strength enough

Have a little faith in me",Have a Little Faith in Me,1994
Joe Cocker,"I've kept it inside much too long
There's no relief
Carry it around just like a stone
Too heavy for me

I have paid the price of standing 
On the outside looking in 

It's time to let the healing begin

A boy is strung out he's going through hell
His mother weeps
His spirit is broken and there's nothing left
Just a terrible need

And the days are marked by the heaviness of the heart
It never mends
Until the healing begins

And the tension prowels the streets like an animal
The people stay behind their locks and chains
It's a shame
When so many are trying their best to live as one
And the smoke from the fires covers up the sun

A young girl is lying in the dirt
Her dreams ended there
Caught in the crossfire on somebody's turf
Hatred in the air

It's a voice that never sings
A winter without the spring
It never ends
Time to let the healing begin
Time to let the healing begin
",Let the Healing Begin,1994
Joe Cocker,"[Chorus:]
Out of this world
Out of this mind
Out of this love for you
Out of this world
Out of the blue
Out of this love for you
Sometimes I don't know you
You're like someone else
But that's allright
I'm a stranger here myself
She don't shed a tear
When I walk out that door
She knows, she knows
I'll be coming back for more
[Chorus]
It's in the cards
It's written in the stars
It's in the wee-wee hours
In some lonely bar
She don't stay up all night
And walk the floor
She knows damn well
I'll be coming back for more

I could count on one hand
With a left over finger or two
I took them all slip away
Where they are I wish I knew
They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst
Sometimes I remember
Sweethearts I've known
Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger
Oh and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go
They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst
The sidewalk is crowded
The city rolls by
And I rush through another day
In a world full of strangers
Turn there eyes to me

As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell

Help me find a way to fill these empty hours
Say you will come again tomorrow

She would stare across the water from the trees
Last time he was home he held her on his knees
And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
And stay until my ships can find the sea

She was a comfort and a mercy through and through

We had brought her things down to the bay -- what could I do

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How could I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Joe Cocker,"None of my business, getting all of my concern
Tried to put out the fire, but the flame still burns
And as she pleases she comes and goes
She's got the wind in her hair
She never ceases to hurt me so
Does she really care?
Is she ever coming home?
Is she ever gonna phone?
Another night alone
Has anybody seen my girl?
Has anybody seen my woman?

Send my baby home to me
Where am I going, oh what am I gonna do?
I know I'm not crazy, I'm just hooked on you

Sometimes I feel a little mad
But, don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

Baby,sometimes I'm so carefree with a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never mean to do
Because I love you.

Oh,oh baby don't you know I'm human
I have thoughts like any other one
Sometime I find myself regretting some foolish thing
Some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

I'm feeling the strain
And missing you so desperately
I need the shelter of your arms tonight
Oh baby, I need you by my side

I don't know why
Things go the way they do
They just keep on taking me down
I can't deny I'm so into you
And lost when you're not around
If I could hold you
I could let go of the pain
But tonight I've got a heart full of rain

Unkind words blindly spoken
Faith was broken
And you walked away
From this world out love created
Hope has faded
Return your flame
To this heart full of rain

A heart full of rain
And memories
Love's not in vain
Even if you should say
You no longer need me
I'll keep believing
Until all that remains
Is your memories
And a heart full of rain
Your memory
And a heart full of rain

Joe Cocker,"I'm coming home, needing attention
Breaking down, I need some rest
I'm like a man from the third dimension
This way of life put me to the test

I used to be a drummer man
Kept it in the groove
Then I had a change of heart
Started singing the blues

That's what I choose 
Leaving me high lonesome blue

Time moves on I'm riding with it
There's no choice, it's out of my hands
This is my way and I won't quit it 
Fragile, like a rope of sand

There's a place high on a mountain
Where I go to find relief
Get my feet back on the ground
Set my spirit free

Put on my walking shoes
Got the high lonesome blue

There's nothing left to prove
High lonesome blue

That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

She blew my nose and then she blew my mind.

Joe Cocker,"It's come down to just the two of us
Me and my shadow on the wall
Radio playing softly somewhere down the hall
And over in the next room
The hollow sound of a cigarette cough
Oh I'm sitting across from midnight
And morning's a long way off

There's a fire in a trash can
In the alley below
The down and outers gather round
Sippin' wine and talkin' low
We're companions of the night time
We got no place to go
Sittin' across from midnight
And time draggin' by too slow

You can feel the night when you're all alone
There's comfort in the room you keep hangin' on
You wait until the dawn

The skeletons in the closet
March around like a platoon
I guess it's too much to ask for
I need some breathing room
And the tall city buildings 
They cover up the moon 
Oh I'm sitting across from midnight
And morning can't come too soon

The early morning hours
Bring out the darkness of your thoughts 
And you're sitting across from midnight 
And morning a long way off
",Across from Midnight,1997
Joe Cocker,"The full moon's glowing
Blood red in the sky
It hangs like fire
On this winter's night
I sit on feelings
That hang in suspense
Nothing in my life makes sense

A question mark hangs with the stars up above
As I'm driving home to the one that I love
Sometimes I can't see the trees for the wood
Loving you tonight feels good [Repeat x 2]
Loving you tonight [Repeat x 2]

The moonlight changes
From red into white
It sits on treetops
Asleep for the night
I see the signpost
The road slowly bends
Nothing in my life makes sense

A flashing tail light speeds across the sky
My head's cooking trouble as thoughts seem to fry
The last temptation was misunderstood
Loving you tonight feels good [Repeat x 2]
Loving you tonight [Repeat x 2]

I'm faced with the ultimate truth
What if I see that things don't improve
I know they could
Loving you tonight feels good [Repeat x 3]

The sun is rising
There's mist all around
She sleeps beside me
And I feel so proud
Am I in heaven
With her by my side
This is how love feels tonight

Joe Cocker,"Papa, why do you play all the same old songs
Why do you sing with the melody
'Cause down on the street something' goin' on

Still I have no regrets
Just like you, I was such a rebel
So dance your own dance and never forget

Every generation ha its way
A need to disobey
N'oubliez jamais
It's in your destiny
A need to disagree
When rules get in the way

Mama, why do you dance to the same old songs
Why do you sing only harmony
'Cause down on the street something's goin' on
There's a brand new beat and a brand new song

In my heart there's a young girls passion
For a life long duet
Someday soon someone's smile will haunt you
So sing your own song and never forget

Every generation ha its way
A need to disobey
N'oubliez jamais
It's in your destiny
A need to disagree
When rules get in the way

Searching for love or fame
That's all the same
One of this days
You say that
Love will be the cure
I'm not so sure

She was lying on the beach
In her graduation gown
She was wrapped up in a blanket
(I could tell she knew her way around)
And as I lay down beside her
You know she never made a sound
On down the beach came the beach-cleaning man
Scoopin' up the papers and flattening down the sand

""Lucinda, Lucinda, Lucinda - we've got to run away
That big white truck is closin' in
And we'll get wounded if we stay""
Now Lucinda lies buried 'neath the California sand

Joe Cocker,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

Joe Cocker,"Papa, why do you play all the same old songs
Why do you sing with the melody
'Cause down on the street something' goin' on
There's a brand new beat and a brand new song

In my life there was so much anger
Still I have no regrets
Just like you, I was such a rebel
So dance your own dance and never forget

N'oubliez jamais
I heard my father say
Every generation ha its way
A need to disobey
N'oubliez jamais
It's in your destiny
A need to disagree
When rules get in the way
N'oubliez jamais

Mama, why do you dance to the same old songs
Why do you sing only harmony
'Cause down on the street something's goin' on
There's a brand new beat and a brand new song

In my heart there's a young girls passion
For a life long duet
Someday soon someone's smile will haunt you
So sing your own song and never forget

I heard my father say
Every generation ha its way
A need to disobey

It's in your destiny
A need to disagree
When rules get in the way

What is this game
Searching for love or fame
That's all the same
One of this days
You say that
Love will be the cure
I'm not so sure

It took five months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again
To fall in love all over, I guess with you, I'll never win

March was cold in more ways than one
I went down to the nightclub lookin' for the sun
Lookin' for the light that could brighten up a day
That's been darker than a hole since you went away

April usually brings showers
This time it was a hurtin' kind
This woman said she wanted my baby
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind
To fall in love with someone, someone that I barely knew
The child would never really have a father
Oh and I'd be stuck, stuck on u

It took five women to getcha off of my mind
Get off my mind, baby
Fallin' in love all over, you I'll never win

May was her name and she was jumpin'
Jumpin' from plane to plane
She was an actress or model or somethin'
Can't even remember her first name

June brought an Easter bunny
Needless to say, that girl was late
Told a million stories to a busy-body of our one and only date

July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary
It felt so much, so much like yours
That only made me, made me want you more
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here
I want you very [Incomprehensible]

It took five women to getcha off of my mind
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time
Oh, but it just took five minutes when I saw your face again
To fall in love all over, I guess with you, I'll never win

Joe Cocker,"I'm tossing and turning and I can't get to sleep 
Got something on my mind I just can't release 
Then she whispers so softly that she believes in me 

If I let her down and tried to disguise it 
She always see's through it always replies that 
No matter what I do she believes in me 

All the times I failed gone slightly off the rails 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
When it all goes wrong and I feel I'm on my own 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 

Don't get me wrong I'm not some kind of fool 
I'd give her my world if she asked me to 
'Cause here's no denying she believes in me 

But I'm only human I'm just a guy 
That sometimes makes mistakes and I can't explain why 
Some say she's crazy but she believes in me 

All the times I failed gone slightly off the rails 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
When it all goes wrong and I feel I'm on my own 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 

She believes in me in what I do 
She believes in me I need her too 
She believes in god above 
She believes when we make love

The way a woman should

Picking up pieces of my broken heart 
Yeah, but one touch of your healing hand

Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning, 
Are you still free, can you be

How the endless road unwinds you 
When there's no one left to leave 
You even you don't quite believe you

Her sunny smile is my only light
To love her now is the sole thing that I'm after
I'll make her melody my life

Lifted the shadow from across my way

Brought back the sun into my days

I'm a witness to the wonder of her ways

And through love we both learned sharing

Sometimes late at night
I close my eyes
And pretend that you're here with me
But every time it rains
I realize just how lonely my life is going to be
Every time it rains
Every time I hear the raindrops fall
I may say that I don't mind it at all
But I do
Every time it rains
Every time I try to tell myself
That in time I'll find somebody else
But it won't be you

How in the world do you think everybody's 'sposed to respect you?
If you don't give a heck about the man with the Bible in his hand
Just get out of the way and let the gentleman do his thing.
You the kind of gentleman want everything your way.
Take the sheet off your face boy, it's a brand new day.

'Cause if you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good, good hootenanny boy.

Something 'cause you're here
You're going out the world backward like you did when you first
Came 'ere.
Keep talking about the president won't stop air pollution.
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough, that'll help the

You cuss around women folk, don't even know their name,
Then you're dumb enough to think it makes you a big ole man.

Maybe luck was here with me

There's nothing left to be desired

Is the air that I breathe

Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our lives, out there to find

No time to cry

I have visions of many things 
Happiness is just an illusion 
Filled with sadness and confusion 

[Chorus]
What becomes of the broken hearted 
Who have love that's now departed 
I know I've got to find some kind of piece of mind 

Roots of love grow all around 
But for me they come tumbling down 
Every day heart aches grow a little stronger 
I can't stand this pain much longer 

Walk in shadows searching for light 
Cold and alone no comfort in sight 
Hoping and praying for someone to care 
Always moving but going no where 

[Chorus]

I'm searching though I don't succeed 
But someones love leaves a growing need 
Always lost there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

That her face, at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see.

And would not let her be

Who were leaving for the coast

You're putting me through
I try to walk away, something makes me stay

I live my life, just like

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you

It makes the cloudy day sunny
Makes the bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt the gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then, and then
Find it's only your imagination again
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example, I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

I delight in your love,

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree

I'm not entirely to blame

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for
