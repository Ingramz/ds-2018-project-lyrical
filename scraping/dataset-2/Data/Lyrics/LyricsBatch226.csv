Algado & Shoballotti,"I'll murder you...you...and you
Don't give a fuck about you..you...

[Chorus: ]
It's Thugged Out Entertainment nigga 
Straight like that
We club, shoot, stab, sell crack
Straight like that
We eat, sleep, shit street life
Straight like that
We get knocked by the same ?
Straight like that

We gettin' bitches, bitches, money, money, basically
There ain't no kissin', we just fuckin' honeys, basically
You see why'all snitchin' niggaz talkin' funny, basically
Me and my niggaz is known to keep it ugly, basically


I'm off the ?yelzabob? I walk wit the mac in my sweats
Air forces, wife beater, fitted cap to the left
My chain hang 35 inches, my heat 7 and a quarter
Beard 8 and a third, and my piece be Orca
There's no need for peace offers, my niggas be shootin', we riot
We run the streets quiet, 'cause the law's biased
Skip the battles back in 86, now niggaz tattle, chop crazy bricks
Cop new kicks, quick to say they rich
Fantasize and flatten the hills, for niggaz in ghettos
Its crack, bullets that kill, dreams are fulfilled
Murders, ink in cold blood, holdin' grudges for years
I keep two bitches, two hot biscuits, four dot sixes
The sorrow to swallow, I follow my motto
Squeeze first, since the day I slung, ready rockin' a bottle
I stand and deliver like Edward Olmos, wet whatever
Respect whatever, I talk with a tech forever


Our show's at your service on behalf of Final Chapter
? I'm not a rapper, quick to slap ya
Got scheme, its not a factor, we gotta shine first
Have 'em coppin' your album just for our verse
Straight like that, why'all better tell 'em
I hope they don't act like we won't smack to back of their cerebellum
Oh and did I mention? if I feel tension
Get the full arm extension, get the whole block's attention
I know you keep your life in your cash
Your cash in the stash, stash in the car, car in the lot
So when I blow up the lot ::BOOM:: your whole shit stop
Why'all rappers is backwards, make the game flip flop
I'll take you to the spot with no witnesses and no cops
Better have your glock out and cocked, about to pop
To hustlers like Flynt, sellin' cracks like Sprint
A dime a minute, now roll the dice, five in it

[Chorus: ] 

Aiyyo, aiyyo
I peeped your true colors while why'all niggaz was blinded
I been down and spit a pound before you knew I was rhymin'
You know me, illest flow, ain't no seconds for timing
My sixteens'll rip through beats, cut deeper than diamonds
Make ya niggaz start to worry 'cause my hood is dark and blurry
When shots flurry, niggaz point guard like Marbury
Ain't no arguing, all my click'll do is get the targeting
Final Chapter split pies in two, its half bargaining
I've seen you niggaz come up quick and then fall
I've seen you frontin' for your broad like her pussy's the bomb
Clowns findin' their stash gone but my cash is long
So I'ma let why'all pass on, 'cause you ass like a thong
My click is movin' out, now is you rollin' along?
'Til I perish I'm spittin' strong, it's that shit that I'm on
Final Chapter's comin' at ya, now the drama is born
Settle in this street life from the hoods to the lord

Aiyyo I'm still ghetto, that's why these niggaz love me
I'm still on the run eatin' so I got chubby
I spaz up in the Tunnel, stab niggaz with pens
That's why 'til this day they don't let me in
I be in New York smokin' LA weed
I hate a bitch named Pebbles like LA Reed
I dead niggaz like Pac and Big, blocks to live
These niggaz can't eat like hostages
Fuck Camry's and fuck Honda Accords
I rob niggaz like the Crips at the Source Awards
And everything that went down was cool with me
As long as I came back with my jewelry
We had machine guns, I think we had two or three
And two or three limos, me and my nigga Timbo
For bitches that suck nuts and spit it out the window
You know my tempo, like Bloody Money 3

Algebra Blessett,"I never meant to hurt you
She was just a friend

I know I've made mistakes
Times before did ignore
The pain in your voice
There was writing on the wall

And it don't take a fool to see
You were right for me
Meant to be in the beginning
Why we had to take this fall

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

Girl, I never meant to hurt you
Didn't really mean to hurt you
Tried my best to show I love you
And it all turned out so wrong

I'll be sitting waiting for you
'Cause I know patience is a virtue
Gonna do just what I got to
Girl, I love you

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I had some time to think about this
She's your friend and not our friend
That was a problem from the beginning
I care for you and I trust you too without guessing
But intentions of some folks, I had to question

I tried my best to show you I loved you
I never thought you'd hurt my emotions
If she was just a friend then why does it hurt so?
If there's nothing going on, honey, I will stay with you

It's like a plan gone wrong since you've been gone
Nights alone, my worlds gone cold
It's like I'm hiding from my soul

I had to meditate and concentrate
On doing with disappointing me
Honey, I want to come home

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I never thought you'd hurt my emotions

To a world she never knew

Like with her there is nothing wrong
But although she tries
You can see the tracks from the tears that she cries
All night long
And she constantly wishes
for the house and the picket fence
and a big back yard
and she hopes one day that her prince will take her away
to a life that ain't so hard

Algebra Blessett,"This song's about a friend
A friend I've known since I was a child
He and I would talk about our lives
And what we thought love was all about
He was my boy
I love that boy to death and
Even now not much has changed
Except for how I see him with my heart
'Cause now my eyes don't see the same
But he has no idea
How I feel inside
So I go on with my foolish pride
Walking away
Though deep inside
I wanna stay

This day I was prepared
And vulnerable as I could be
But when he stopped by
I couldn't even speak
'Cause of what stood right in front of me
To my surprise
He brought along someone
Oh some random chick that he just met
As usual I smiled and shook her hand
Covering up my heart again

But he has no idea
How I feel inside
So I go on with my foolish pride
Walking away
Though deep inside
I wanna stay

So I go on with my foolish pride
So I go on all alone at night
So I go on living knowing it ain't right
So I just let my heart continue to hide
Knowing my heart is so empty inside
I know he should be here by my side
I should be holding him instead of my pillow tight

Makes me walk away

No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life
It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak
Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace
But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach deep
Deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

Will soon be no more

Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Ali,"Life, what is it for real, I don't know
It's like hate taking over the whole world, what is it over?
Suicide, man, that's the devil trying to control us, they told us
But we didn't notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar,
System got us hopeless, and focused on foreclosures
Wake up and smell the Folgers, oh momma and bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9 11 was bogus, now we right back at him
Say the war is our motive

Wake up early in the streets of the block, 
Streets of the block
He posted up on the corner 
Like a soldier in the drill but he wouldn't stop
Living life in the battlefield, battlefield, 
Trying to survive every day and every night
It's the same deal
Life's strange life's strange, times change times change, 
But karma always finds the way
Stay strong, stay strong, hold on, hold on
Don't let all your dreams fade away

Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going,till it feels like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard,and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way

A lot of mothers they just don't understand, 
They just don't understand
They think we're hard on our sons 
But we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
They only know when they walk out the door, 
When they walk out the door
See we can show em how to fire 
But they gotta teach themselves how to reload
'Cause unemployment is harder than its ever been, 
Sometimes it feels like I cant win
And even through all the rules keep changing, 
I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
'Cause on my own is a better way
'Cause on my own is a better way

Hey, hey, going through the back streets like I got beef
Carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
Animalistic it's why we call the cops beast
We're on the hunt, cause they're hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping through my heart beat, 
Brain is the base, my heart is the drum
Give the drum some, promise 
Of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, 
I'm trying to live

'Cause all I want is a better way,
Hey, if you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real and never let it go

And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets harder, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
'Cause on my own is a better way
'Cause on my own is a better way",Go,2010

Like Presents, she worked at the liquor sto'
So I don't pay for blunts or them bottles of Mo'
She got the hookup, she loves to bone
She love the way the new Q sittin' on chrome
She love the way the hood, talk about it
How it used to be rowdy, calmed down and got bout it
I can't doubt it, it's deep more than just sexin'
It's conversation buildin' the Earth based on lessons
Pussy ain't shit without a brain behind it

We sit and talk, net game, net lost
Portfolio, she a broker I bought
Two cribs in Spanish Lake, one in Burlington down
She put me on at no fees, just me around
It's sufficient, ate your momma Diva in the kitchen
Veggie burger with cabbage, fresh water lavish
She study and meditate, part-time student
Work a lot, only I can hit the spot
Showin' self-control, controllin' my soul
Easy come, easy go, but all women ain't hoes

Like Crane that's my boo, I got nothin' but love
She got a fat ass she work at the gentlemen's club
Straight freaky, straight kinky, straight wild
She like to ride but she love dogs with style
Only if her son ain't home, even though we grown
That's somethin' she want him to come to on his own
So we do a lot at Radisson and Embassy Suites
Sometimes we don't make it, end up in the backseat
She go to Fontbonne, low cuts to class
Keeps the boys horny, and the faculty mad
But it's real with me, do you I got the back
Cause me and you connectin, it's hard to find that

This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big league

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying

All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain

Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big league

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up",Batter Up,2000

Still, your thicky thicky thicky thick
Looking like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick girl
Your thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' hit the switch girl
Your thicky thicky thicky thick
Could it be a crime that I'm waitin' to commit girl?
Your thicky thicky thicky thick

So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When are you that shoes untied before you know it method
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's getting hectic
Wreck it just like a hoopty with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles
Twistin' and pulling
I'm like shorty help me (come on)
Help me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile,
So I take advantage
Kissin' in gentle places trying to get myself established
I'm comfortable, want to be in that moe
With no control
Concentrating on my every lick, her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know
It's on, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set

Skirts, there they are, gots to flirt cause I'm far
From Average Lame with that ""What's your name?"" game
I'm stormin' on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran
All up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan
Leavin' me like a van in reverse, that's the worse
Playa curse put up on me now
We spreadin' on my homies like a germ
Watch me turn into captain kill a ho
Fill a ho strong
Watch me last long like a penny broke many motels
I got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on futons
Comin' out like Keyuan
I'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, godamnit
That's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb
Showin' action like an ass like a metaphor

Just to get their ass back home
Come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin' a nigga like hoop for Atlanta (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house, trick, who you think you fuckin with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go
(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, hit any one of you niggas rat
Spit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin'
Go make the announcment, spark more Dynamite than ""Good Times""
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin', headboards you be grabbin'
Got 'em bangin the walls so hard the neighbors callin'

Asking you ""What happened? What's goin on over there even?
Sounds like you guys are goin crazzzzzzzyy""

But rap-wise (rap-wise)

I'm out here on these streets
Trying to survive through the cocked heat
The block deep, pop you once watch the spot leak
But right now, I'm trying to restrain from that
But if you trip, I'll grab that thang and let him spray from that
I'm just a God of the universe, nothing more, nothing less
Don't believe in spooks, I missed three places after death
My mind is clear, while yours is full of distortions
From all that flesh you eat, and scrambled abortion
My portion is one, yours is three
3D, you claim to God Lee, not hardly
You looking for Leezuz partner? Well her I am
Walking on water with 3 dumples in 2 hands
Whoa damn! Let me slow it down one time
Resurrect the mind and give sight to the blind
How many eyes you got? You say 2, I say 3
You see what I'm saying, and you still seeing me?
You add it up

Just do what's right y'all (tell 'em) and that's the bomb

We roll real drinks, shots of City in the clinc
I said shrink, last night hurling in the sink
Boy think, know your type, don't gun snipe or gripe
But couldn't get doper than this unless it came through a pipe
I'm trying to tell y'all, 'Tics drop shit, we here to sell y'all
The truth, real always, tight like hallways
Brawl like ball face, squint the God pay
Hit, bumping and flick, collecting green print then
Heavy cent, we roll the third behind the tent
Tires spent, and then we float like lint
Me and the man child, since a youth we ran wild
Gats busting at everybody, ""Hands down!""
Big house, mouse zip blouse for the spouse
Crazy bucks, tv's and rims on crazy trucks
It's the Ghostrider, a new science to God a-
Blunt provider, the kit made the 6 wider
I serve, touch nerves that swerve in a Suburb'
Out of life I deserve, define wisdom define herb
It's the verbal abuse, what's the use of calling truce?
Let's ooze loose out tools, Lee without the Bruce
And while you cats go popping bop, me I'm out tops
break it down like shop chops and come off like flip flops
That's hip hop

Cause the Freak Nick turned me out, I always new that
Years they depieced trees applied the woo wat
Here comes another nigga from the MO, think I'm scared of the mic
For this I waited a long time, haters wanna block my shine
Cause the way of my words are put together plus I'm still in my prime

In the Guinness Book World's endless is where it's classified

Trife drop a track so I, made up a rhyme

[Intro]
Uh uh, Ali and Murphey
Uh uh, School Boy with the College Boy
And ah, and ah..

[Hook: Murphey + Ali]
Ali and Murphey is.. bourgeois baby
If it ain't ghetto.. it don't move me baby
Got a lake, a pool.. and a jacuzzi baby
But it's still McDonald's.. and a movie baby
That's so crazy!

[Ali]
Check
I'm at the bar, industry party, caviar
Denim suits, superstar, Cigarello cigars
Spittin bars to this footer in stilettoes
She boughetto, that mean she bourgeois and ghetto
Bourgeois 'cause her shoes alone cost a grand
Ghetto 'cause she cuss too much and talk with her hands
She say she don't fuck wit rap since Mase got saved
But baby got back like mace got spray
You know the bourgeois type, ass boombastic
Mabelline queen, titties all plastic
Niggaz front with they tank on empty
They ask for e'rythang 'cause the top off her Bentley
I roll the truck slow, the gas; I ease on it
I got a trailer on the back, four-wheeler with D's on it
Got the leather with the G's on it, gangsta gangsta
Gotta get it get it good and...

[Hook: Murphey + Ali]

[Hook 2: Ali + Murphey]
If you got an expensive weave - That's boughetto!
Spend six hundred on weed - That's boughetto!
Benz while ya sittin on D's - That's boughetto!
Tell em what's boughetto - Bourgeois and ghetto!

[Murphey Lee]
Yo Murph' is bourgeois - School boy; ghetto
What more can I say? I'm boughetto
Aiyyo I'm beautif-hetto, that's beautiful and ghetto
I got plenty war stories, plenty hood medals
Did alotta wrong with alotta good fellows
But I got my shit together (Hello!)
I took my hustlin ways from them scufflin days
To eight million copies on my resume
I moved right out the hood, 'cause I don't like the hood
I tell all my people to think twice in the hood
The police; man they don't even lie
'cause they got Spud and Boone and 'Trelle up in Riker's
And I just like what the money can get
A little head e'ry now and then so honey can spit
Chrome tips, a hundred an forty four of them shits
And a big ass crib cuz...

[Both Hooks]

[Ali]
A boughetto pimp loose and I know it 'cause I come to party
late, smellin like weed, no matter who throw it
I'm in the curl cap, didn't get paid but done a rap
Dem ain't Rolex diamonds - what the fuck you done to that?!
Throwin trash out the Benz on the highway
But the old school still spillin all in the driveway
And if it stop, never a towtruck pull me home
Fuckin I keep the socks, had the jewelry on
I'm like a pimp in the 80's, a Reverend Run
Preachin it to em, gassin em up like Chev-e-ron
Got the D's the beeps and the televis-ion
And my Sprint (Brrrrr..) like a boughetto telethon
But I'm bourgeois forever 'cause I got it to spend it
Ghett-o, put rims on the car that I rented
Trump money, but it's still the motel and Kyjuan
And Slo and Nelly and...

These streets, is way too crucial
I just don't know, 'bout fuckin' with new hoes
These streets, is way too crucial
I just don't know, 'bout fuckin' with new hoes

[Ali]
I keep the same flock, treat em good
Get they mind right, and take em out the hood
Fuck a new ho, I keep it real though
Buy em new clothes and shit, but, um, no dough

[Ali]
Like Presents, she worked at the liquor sto'
So I don't pay for blunts or them bottles of Mo'
She got the hookup, she loves to bone
She love the way the new Q sittin' on chrome
She love the way the hood, talk about it
How it used to be rowdy, calmed down and got bout it
I can't doubt it, it's deep more than just sexin'
It's conversation buildin' the Earth based on lessons
Pussy ain't shit without a brain behind it
Got these queens actin' like hoes simple-minded
Never overzealous, I gasp at what a lady tell us

I keep the same flock, treat em good
Get they mind right, and take em out the hood
Fuck a new ho, I keep it real though
Buy em new clothes and shit, but, um, no dough

Like Moon she conservative, stackin' the funds
Manage Foot Locker so I keep Air Force Ones
We sit and talk, net game, net lost
Portfolio, she a broker I bought
Two cribs in Spanish Lake, one in Burlington down
She put me on at no fees, just me around
It's sufficient, ate your momma Diva in the kitchen
Veggie burger with cabbage, fresh water lavish
She study and meditate, part-time student
Work a lot, only I can hit the spot
Showin' self-control, controllin' my soul
Easy come, easy go, but all women ain't hoes

Like Crane that's my boo, I got nothin' but love
She got a fat ass she work at the gentlemen's club
Straight freaky, straight kinky, straight wild
She like to ride but she love dogs with style
Only if her son ain't home, even though we grown
That's somethin' she want him to come to on his own
So we do a lot at Radisson and Embassy Suites
Sometimes we don't make it, end up in the backseat
She go to Fontbonne, low cuts to class
Keeps the boys horny, and the faculty mad
But it's real with me, do you I got the back
Cause me and you connectin, it's hard to find that

Ali,"Rollin' in a drop top, ol school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats
Rollin' in a drop top, ol school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats

Yo, I'ma sucka for head wraps, no perms, just naps
Long shirt, fat ass, wit a brain to match
No poke, no soda, no talkin' back, grabbin' 'em out of college
I'm wisdom lookin' for knowledge, who got it
I got it, I love it when you get that Zippendale in ya body
And shakin' ya la-de-da-de, in the party
Gon' shawty, now throw it on me naughty
And if both of y'all together, I'm in the center like Jahadi

And I like that, plus the both of y'all so fine
Why should I bite back, I'm just waistin' my lines
And havin' time after time, I'm just speakin' my mind
It don't matter if I'm in the range, or the Benz I'ma shine
Now ask, who that is, walkin' and talkin' that bull stuff
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they truck pulled up
Am I gon' sweat that, hell naw, I'm gon' go
Out the do', to the ride, and just roll

Rollin' in a drop top, ol' school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats
Rollin' in a drop top, ol' school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats

Check, check, well I got no love for losin'
Never been full of hate, no love for Uzi's
Wahchin' me again and again, like favorite movies
MC's wit brains, obsessed wit oochie-coochie
I got more flavor than them, motherfucker
You other facts of life acts too no but, no drink, I gets very moody
I guess that why, I'm in love wit bud just like brew
Truly yours, see my concert be too packed, just like Shakur

What's in store, I'ma let jet like Acu-ra
Gas pedal hit the floor, zoom like the Camadors
See I'm your, lunatic for hire
A will call them MC's out like a bad umpire you're outta here
I snap neck, like a T roll before we retire
Oh Jim Carrey ass nigga, quit being a liar, liar
Am I gon' sweat that, hell naw, I'm gon' go
Out the do', to the ride, and just roll

Rollin' in a drop top, ol' school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats

Rollin' in a drop top, ol' school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats

Now for real, I be to break 'em off
Hoe hopper, trick knocker, nobody does like we do each proper
Think he like papa, when I drop her
Lyin' on that ass now we fuckin' 'til the beat don't stop her
Could it be I move too smooth, groove
That'll make the whole party move
Spots I keep 'em hot, so honey be hot to try
Pull up on the lot, black gloves and a Glock

My crew stand up, y'all crew catch rounds
Desert EG, 4 pound, it's got to, go down
Should I sweat that, hell naw I'm gon' go
Out the do', to the ride, and just roll

Uh, Ali, Ali, keep rollin'
St. Lunatics, keep rollin'

Rollin' in a drop top, ol' school on 20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long

[Intro]
Yo, let me take all this jewelry off, hold on, hold on
I'm about to take it to the street
(Go get Nelly, go get Murph, Kyjuan, all them, lets go bring 'em here)
Turn me up in the headphones too, cus I'm here (Heavy Starch)
(I'm about to press this shit)
Yo, go tell them, run and tell them Ali coming
I said bring me along, bring me along, bring me along, Ali is coming (Whoa, Hang)
Bring me along, bring me along, bring me along, Ali is coming (Whoa, Hang)

[Verse 1]
How many mill' must we sell before they respect the 'L
And realize it ain't for us, it's all for Lavell 
Pass that so I can educate the uneducated
And stress the fact it's self-braided, we finally made it
Went from buying pound, from Mr. Down-Down Baby
Playing it cool, fan duckin' click-crack-crazy
Getting the crack daily, pay me
My tree in life was precise to a swisher in the light (whoa, hang)
Boy get it right before I go left, baseline pay off the ref
Technical fire were fucking Chillida to death
Its from the studio, then right to the block, I writer's block
Cus everything I right for the block, is right from the block
Pokemon riffle in glock, bumble be socked
Orange Juice in my pocket in case I swallow my rocks
I did my hustle y'all, we a bad mother fucker y'all
'Tic nigga respect that, where the boys at?

[Chorus]
Dirty I Got This
Round and Round and? Dirty drop the beat, go round and watch this beat go
Round and Round and? Dirty let the beat go
Dirty I Got This
Round and Round and? Dirty let the beat, go around and watch this beat go
Round and Round and? Dirty let the beat go round

[Verse 2]
Now when it comes to rapping and going platinum
Our have to get it like Osama Bin Laden walking the streets of Manhattan
Give me them sheets to say Patented and you biting these Tims and fat laces
It won't happen, I'll let you slide with the jersey backwards; I back words
Rap verb, and if I had more time
I'd show you how to turn that half to a bird
Lead the new, leave the Hannibal hectic off the meter
And you non-believers, you're wrong for that like Cita
The black Einstein ruled the war never a kind line
catch up like Heinz cus he owns a rhyme
I'm real listed, On the real list I'm listed
Really listen, cus this is for those that really listen
Really listening for competition
MC's is mixing like it's the source awards
Should knight go in the door
Big 8 for the track rap javelin hurdle hops
I write in hotels before shows trailers and tow-toppers  

[Chorus]

(Still coming with it, I'm an addict y'all,
 still at it! Check It Out, Check It, Check It)
I'm still at it, I'll give it to an addict who's had it
Still got it yours need fluffing this manic
I rhyme graphic heavily tattered shots to ram bank
He'll back small 6-9 erratic
In a automatic pumping jigga 22-2
Sitting on 22's but the spiral 22-2
Shot with the Rubes in the desert and that 22-2
This is 139, almost 22-2 (whoa hang)
Got home the Rams was up 22-2
Interception about Halloway he wear 22
Minnie on my phone like hook me up with Nelly
Ali, please dawg, I'm 22-2
I like them classy 23's with they back out
Classic ESPN say 23 back out
When over I guess I bring them 23's back out
And that 22-2 with 3 in it's so pimped out

[Chorus]

Dirty drop the beat, go round and watch this beat go
Dirty let the beat go
Dirty drop the beat, go round and watch this beat go
Dirty let the beat go

Top down air forces white tank and shit
Ain't nothing soft on boy stop thankin' it
I got a trophy at the playa ball banquet

This bank I get style we all that
To the back we all that to the back
Red or blue new wall cap
Pause that bull shit you talking bout
Before the people start walkin out

If you please we succeed regardless
Shine the hardest and I'll sign an artist
Longevity like the Beegee's

1993 creation for steps of born leezys
Wrote rhymes in class, bored by teachers
Church only on easter, ignore the preacher
Do the grown up at school right under the bleachers

A wild little bity doin' lunatic rules
To this day they be like lunatic rules
I'm hangin' wit the dudes that done it, don't even stunt it
You cats stay in the back doin' too much frontin'

See you hate us like to take risk son of a bitch
I really disc jockeys at home jockin' my disc

School boy 5'9 receive the hairlines and halfway rich

I'm gon' run niggas out of town
Naw fuck y'all hate us I'm gon chill 'til they run out of crown

[Verse 1: Kyjuan]
I really hate to see her leave but I love to see her walk off
Imagine what her *oooo* looks like with her clothes off
I'm rolling with the top off, see tops come off
When the streetlights go off I heard shots go off
I'm a humble show-off I'll be beating when I roll off
Pumping Jill Scott number seven in front of the seven-eleven
Grab some magnum protection gonna be some sexin'
Wrap some hemp and L's its gonna be a session
She stressing the fact that we gotta stay at the best western
I ain't cheap and that's on everything 
Put her pants to her knees don't take off everything
I pay for her chains staying near her cain's 
Sipping on her cane I'm forgetting everything
My name Kyjuan, yeah Kyjuan left none
Boy she wouldn't have been with me if you wouldn't have left her
I left her sexed her stressed her and left her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
My sex steno cus I'm taxing it I smack it a little
Stir it up like mother fuckin coffee then back to the middle
Lift over some pounds some way my hitters nod away 
You damn near caught a Charlie-horse to make your dick stay in the hole
Oh we fuckin now pumping like all my pow
Ass up face down I'm going to town
Round and round here I go pumping for nothing
Cus she wiggle and wiggle and wiggle just know when I'm coming
I'm like *Ohhhh* I can't take it no more
Move it one more time and watch my knees buckle
She tip drip type quit to get her dirty, hype, and aroused
Always see her nipples through her blouse *Owwww* 
Watch it wiggle just like the Harlem dance
Look at all that ass in those *itty-bitty* pants
Damn, hey Ms. Parker I make that ass come on down like Bob Barker

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Baby girl shake it like a paraplegic please believe it (Wooo)
Knees bent, and back arched just how I need it
Call her ""Billie Jean,"" I like the ""Thriller"" before I ""Beat It""
Conceded when she shake it but I like it like that
Throw it at me even harder just to see me react
See if it's wack, in fact see what Nelly about
I thought that ass was a fluke until I went to her house
You see mama got ass too, her sister Keesha and Sue
Her cousins, aunts and nieces start walking in by two
Like who's trying to keep they composure now
I'm feeling it can't nobody hold me down
Nobody told me how crazy groupies and coochies can get
In the back side under the stage trying to hit
And I'm like ""Baby girl I ain't that kind of guy""
Let me at least let me go get a condom I ain't trying to die
I might be high but I'm not that damn high!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ali]
Oh lord my dick hard call the nurse (why?)
It's getting worse fat asses I gotta flirt
It was me Mo and Murph, Kyjuan was with his earth
Playing pussy it hurt, smoking, passing the smirks
Popping bottle after bottle I'm like ""Here we go again""
Posting it up in the club thinking ""Is he got a win""
My chrome shoes went from Barry to Larry Hughes
Emmitt's 22's now its Jordan's I cruise
But anyway Fo Sho I'm from the show me let me show you
To drunk and out of town trying to kiss you like I know you
In the middle of the dance floor caught the man's attention
Wiggle Wiggle do your thug's hydraulic suspension
Did I mention long Ohhh, ""What the fuck is going on?""
Your body banging ma' I got to take you home
Cool lets break, to the house on the lake
Man this is great I'm dealing with high stakes

You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DMV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Every, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie want to signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find another
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris, slightly a little violated

Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? Me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend nigga I fuck twins
From the back end back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go
Iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Menudo, in the candy black two-door
Bmw Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? Yea, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bits in the Kibble, ménage trois was civil

Hit the mall nigga, and shop 'till we fall

When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throw up a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It's not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match, hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet

(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(Wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. To 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it

Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Just to get up that hill

My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though) 
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

It's like hate taking over the whole world, what is it over?
Suicide, man, that's the devil trying to control us, they told us
But we didn't notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar,
System got us hopeless, and focused on foreclosures
Wake up and smell the Folgers, oh momma and bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9 11 was bogus, now we right back at him
Say the war is our motive

Wake up early in the streets of the block, 
Streets of the block
He posted up on the corner 
Like a soldier in the drill but he wouldn't stop
Living life in the battlefield, battlefield, 
Trying to survive every day and every night
It's the same deal
Life's strange life's strange, times change times change, 
But karma always finds the way
Stay strong, stay strong, hold on, hold on
Don't let all your dreams fade away

Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going,till it feels like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard,and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way

A lot of mothers they just don't understand, 
They just don't understand
They think we're hard on our sons 
But we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
They only know when they walk out the door, 
When they walk out the door
See we can show em how to fire 
But they gotta teach themselves how to reload
'Cause unemployment is harder than its ever been, 
Sometimes it feels like I cant win
And even through all the rules keep changing, 
I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
'Cause on my own is a better way
'Cause on my own is a better way

Hey, hey, going through the back streets like I got beef
Carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
Animalistic it's why we call the cops beast
We're on the hunt, cause they're hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping through my heart beat, 
Brain is the base, my heart is the drum
Give the drum some, promise 
Of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, 
I'm trying to live

'Cause all I want is a better way,
Hey, if you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real and never let it go

And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets harder, and harder, happiness is worth the wait

And I can?t see no wings, and her halo must be tangled in her hair
But when he check, he gon' see he missin' an angel
I just left the studio so I know I smell like Dro
She wit her friends from college, I'm wit neighborhood G?s
She said I talk country (boy you so country) laughin' and lovin' it
Swapped numbers, out of all things I straight gave her my government
It was days it was nights it was winter it was summer
Grab the Mastercard or Visa, it was my pin number
She said lets talk, I'm pregnant, okay lets do this right
Lets take that phrase, baby mama, boo, and change it to Wife
She started shaking and crying hugging harder as tears came
I said I'm happy, Ima' call Jacob you go call Ferra Wayne
I walked out, she said Ali loud and fell to the floor
Took a break and said, it ain't yours (damn)

Ali & Gipp,"The moment I wake up 
Before I put on my makeup 
I say a little prayer for you 
While combing my hair, now, 
And wondering what dress to wear, now, 
I say a little prayer for you 

Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, forever, we never will part 
Oh, how I'll love you 
Together, together, that's how it must be 
To live without you 
Would only be heartbreak for me. 

I run for the bus, dear, 
While riding I think of us, dear, 
I say a little prayer for you. 
At work I just take time 
And all through my coffee break-time, 
I say a little prayer for you. 

Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you 
Forever, forever we never will part 
Oh, how I'll love you

About the way we talk, about the way we dress
How 'bout them diamond grills? How 'bout they lookin' fresh? 
I'm always smokin' good, I'm posted on the lot

So many brand-new niggas, we don't know who to trust
A bunch of pussy-ass rappers tryin' to sound like us
Sweet Jones is a pimp I got bitches on track
Send a hoe out on a mission, tell 'em break 'em, bring it back
Got a house in Hawaii, 'bout to, 'bout to buy a Rolls
Nigga think we just 'bout rapping bitch but dope is getting sold
I'm a young, hot street flame, deep up in the d-game
Smokin' bro, slammin' Cadillac doors, red paint switchin' lane-to-lane
I ain't came to lose bitch, I done paid my dues bitch
Got fifteen years off in this muthafuckin' rap shit
Seen a lot of niggas come, seen a lot of niggas go

I seen some niggas blow, I seen some turn to hoes
Candy cars, candy doors, I got yellow hoes that play wit' they nose
If ya like, she blow in ya butt
Eat ya dick and then lick ya nuts
If I wasn't rappin' baby, I'd still be drivin' this shit
Makin' hoes hide this dick, UGK we live in this bitch
Swisha sweets is a must

And moved the north side city wit this downtown witty
That influenced, project grew 'n' then now '88 gritty
Twelve years old smokin' squares, and by thirteen smokin' water
By fourteen I was a busy boy in somebody daughter
Rockin' them black Stacy Adams and that fresh gold hat

I'm sellin' weed a year later, whoa, here come the crack
I'm sellin' 50's and bopper's the cluckers say I got good
And wit the crack came the gangs, and that divided the hood
And then the war jumped off, some niggas didn't make it a summer
The other niggas locked up, doin' rides, receivin' numbers
I changed my life wit the quickest, for real and laid down the D
I ain't sellin' no mo' but you can still catch me in the hood

I'm from the middle of the map where the river run deep

Knockin' down my glass door, tryin' to rip up my marble floor
But ain't nothin' that for that ass though you know
See that's throwback like Dukey Rope
Candy painted, hundred spokes, baking soda, watch it grow
Gangsta, gangsta? Neva that, but I keep that thing like 'Where he at?'
Ain't no rubber band big enough to hold these stacks

Schlechte Christen halten auch den Weihnachtsmann für 'n Extremisten
Müsst ihr auf Minderheiten immer gleich mi'm Finger zeigen?
Gegenfrage, wieso müsst ihr eure Frauen wie Ninjas kleiden?

Lad' die MP, kille Camps wie Jason Voorhees, brenn die
Poster deiner Idole nieder, Ali As, ihr kennt ihn

Amnesia, schalt die Welt stumm
Bring die eisigen Erinnerungen bis zum Schmelzpunkt
Amnesia, mal die Welt bunt

Ihr hört mich keine Features machen mit denen
Ich bin latent gelangweilt und krieg' eine Kieferstarre vom Gähnen
Hab' in Deutschrap-Videos vier Milliarden Tiefgaragen gesehen
Jeder kam mit Beamer, doch niemand kam mit Ideen
Hallo Deutschland, zünd 'n Joint an, heut' fangen wir neu an
Kurz räuspern, eure Treuhand, ich lass es fließen wie ein Heulkrampf
Hunderttausend Kunstbanausen
Ich bin der Grund, dass draußen Menschen noch an Wunder glauben
Jeder will fliegen und wie Ikarus ins Licht
Dass wir hier allein sind, ist ein Widerspruch in sich
Jeder will ein High-Five für sein' Lifestyle, alles Wi-Fi
Alles zeitgleich, alles Zeitgeist, keiner Freigeist
Alles bleibt gleich, alles bleibt gleich
Ich war in' letzten Jahren so viel unterwegs
Neider nehmen mir das übel wie Imodium-Dragées
Meine Zeit und meine Kleidung sind streng limitiert
Es tut mir Leid, wenn ihr euch nicht damit identifiziert

Ali As,"Okay, Deutschland hängt am Penis von Helene Fischer
Ich sehe ein Medienbiz voll elendiger Szenestricher
Zu viel Scheiße, die durch sämtliche Kanäle sickert
Tret' den faken Seelenstrip in den nackten Arsch mit Edelslipper
Deren Mucke kann man nur als Psychoterror deuten
Es wird Zeit, dass ich für Wirbel sorg' wie Physiotherapeuten
Meine Welt steht Kopf, ich steh' über dem Rest
Ignoranter als Hillbillies in 'nem Südstaatennest
Nutte, check mich - guck, ich rapp' nicht
Ich halte lediglich auf diesem Takt meine Gemütslage fest
Und an sich bin ich ein offener Mensch
Es sei denn, du trägst Klamotten von Bench
Ich bin Poloshop-Stammgast, kriege Blowjobs von Schlampen
Auch wenn sie in festen Händen sind wie Robocops Gun
Ich war zwar fett, doch habe Kalorien verbrannt
Und jetzt steht hier 'n Kraftpaket, als wär' ich Mayo-Lieferant

Die Hits ballern, die Spliffs ballern
Die Drinks und die Pillen und die Chicks ballern
Ballern, ballern, ballern deinen Kopf weg

Auch wenn ich kein Gold erbeute, dass ich das Volk erleuchte
Ist 'n Fakt, der nicht zur Debatte steht wie Wolfgang Schäuble
Ich hol' mir so das Cash ohne großen Stress
Will die Steuer hinterziehen wie Piloten vor dem Crash
Ich hab' ein Faible für Mädels in Edeldessous
Auf jeden und krieg' einen Blowjob wie Penelope Cruz
Fick' die anderen Hunde, das' ein Familientreff
Das ist wie Amazon-Kunden - wir kommen nie ins Geschäft
Bis ihr ballert wie Amnesia-Haze
Auf unserer Seite sieht man Player, nennt uns Mediathek
Die Nase brennt, die Sprache nennt sich Straßenslang
Wer hatet, hat 'n Brett vor'm Kopf wie ein Karatechamp
Ich muss den Brand hier legen, holt schon mal den Krankenwage
Das hier wird 'ne endgültige Misshandlung wie Dankesreden
Egal ob Sänger, Hipster-, Gangster- oder Battlerapper
Ich kille sie alle, Wort drauf, wie bei Scrabble-Brettern

Die Lines sind fett, als schreib' ich Tracks mit 500er Edding
Modedrogen, Ekstasen, hohe Dosen, Scheckkarten
Dein Plan geht gehörig in die Hose so wie Sexsklaven
Oben-ohne-Betthasen, paar Eckdaten zu mir
Studieren ist was für Gays, ich hab' mich exmatrikuliert
Ein weiterer Träumer, der für Hip-Hop stirbt
Die Scheiße ist besitzergreifend wie Gerichtsvollzieher

Ali As,"Es wird Zeit, dass wir wieder in die Ferien gehen
Ich will mehr als 'ne Verkehrsinsel sehen
Keine Parkbuchten statt in Häuserschluchten auf Berggipfeln stehen
Und der Lärm in der Gegend, der Regen hier lähmte mein Nervensystem
Raus aus dem Tohuwabohu
Ich seh' uns schon im Coconut Grove
Pure Spliffs, kein Touri-Shit
Skirt Steaks mit Chimichurri-Dip
Wir machen Party dort
Geldbündel in den Khaki-Shorts
Pagen fahren den Wagen vor
Mit Karte zahlen im Armani-Store
PayPal-Geld, alles selfmade
Aus den LPs werden Caselle Shades
Nach den hundert Jahren wo wir unten verschwunden
Im Dunkeln waren, kriegen wir einen gesunden Teint
Sitzen am Pier oder Stripclub, wo man 'ne Bitch finanziert
Highlife, wir sind mittendrin
Weil - weil wir am dippen sind
Lichterketten, die Palmen säumen
Dis is, wovon wir alle träumen

Wir müssen nichts, wir flüchten bis
Zum Küstenblick, er ist endlos
Die Welt dreht sich hier nur in Slow-Mo
Halt unser'n Moment fest für ein neues Fotoalbum

Wir müssen nichts, wir flüchten bis
Zum Küstenblick, er ist endlos
Die Welt dreht sich hier nur in Slow-Mo
Halt unser'n Moment fest für ein neues Fotoalbum

Yeah, lass mich weiter erzählen
Überdosis Black-Tiger-Garnelen
Haare ungestyled
Wenn das salzige Wasser die Wunden heilt
Nur der Aperol, der bitter schmeckt
Wie die Bilder für Hater per Twitter-App
Der Neustart läuft grad, alle Boys da
Und ich sage in der Jigga-Voice ""Ah!""
Ah, superhigh
Das Weed wie die Hoodies - super dry
Und der Sound aus dem Radio turnt auch
Strandlauf, Cardio-Workout
Ängste vom Wind weggeweht
Am Rand des unendlichen Schwimmbecken stehen
Im Winter lag vor unserer Tür Kies
Heute sieht man nur Samt danach türkis
Die einzige Last hier die Shopping-Tüten
In den edelsten Lobbys mit Jogginganzügen
Und die Girls sind nice
10/10 ist hier die Wirklichkeit
Pfirsich-Eistee und Schirmchen im Drink
Auch wenn es irrsinnig klingt
Lichterketten, die Palmen säumen
Dis is, wovon wir alle träumen

Wir müssen nichts, wir flüchten bis
Zum Küstenblick, er ist endlos
Die Welt dreht sich hier nur in Slow-Mo

Wir nehmen wenigstens jeden Job, ihr seid etepetete
Putzen ekelerregend, wir machen 's wegen der Knete

Ohne euch würd' es für uns manche Probleme nicht geben

Hört auf von Ehre zu reden, ich würd' mich schämen deswegen
Achja, und wer hat Adriano seinen Schädel zertreten?
In euren Köpfen haben sich Vorurteile festgebissen
Schlechte Christen halten auch den Weihnachtsmann für 'n Extremisten
Müsst ihr auf Minderheiten immer gleich mi'm Finger zeigen?
Gegenfrage - wieso müsst ihr eure Frauen wie Ninjas kleiden?
Und wieso macht ihr tagsüber strictly auf Koranschüler?
Abends geht's für paar Liter Whiskey in die Bar rüber
Mach nicht auf Moralhüter, ihr gebt euch zwar tolerant

Was dagegen, dass sich Väter um die Mädchen sorgen?
Was ist dann der Holocaust verglichen mit paar Ehrenmorden?
Kein Wunder, dass sich deutsche Frauen nach Südländern sehnen
Wenn ihr sie einmal in der Woche wie ein Frührentner nehmt
Was andere Länder über eure Sexpraktiken wissen
Sind abartige Dinge wie im Bett kacken und pissen
Ja sicher, sag ich ja gar nichts
Aber in euren Dörfern gibt es sicher ein paar Schafsficker
Zurück zum Thema, deutsche Leute sind sympathischer
Wart, ich hab gehört, ihr seid Schläger oder Grasticker
Ihr seid extreme Leute, Yayodealer, Messerstecher
Und jeder zehnte Deutsche pädophiler Sexverbrecher
Sitz' mit der Bruderschaft im Wirtshaus
Verfluchtes Pack mit Bierbauch - von mir aus!
Die Deutschen sind doch Judenhasser - ihr auch!
Unser Volk ist tugendhaft und deins in Untersuchungshaft

Blutrote Ones, such ?
Weiter als die Schuhsohle kann
Schau nach vorn, du schaust Schulfotos an
Denkst dann, damals auf dem Schulhof zusammen
Ich move solo Zoom Fokus futu-, so cool, so entspannt
Hab genug Flows zur Hand
Vaffanculo, ihr mutlosen Punks
Sipp' einen Ouzo am Subtropenstrand

Alle Erinnerungen gelöscht, hab mich regeneriert
Was ich sag auf den Songs, wiegt ein paar tausend Tonnen
Wart auf den Gong, bis Amnesia wirkt
Bis jede Zeile die Seele reinigt wie Putzkräfte in Kinos
Ging durch die Hölle ohne Schutzweste und ziellos
Mentale Lähmung durch den starken Konsum
Bei dem das Gras schneller weg war als mein Datenvolumen
Musste wieder starten, mich nahmen die Niederlagen mit
Von den Toten heimgekehrt wie 'n Nekrophiler nach dem Fick
Shit, mach den Weg frei draußen
Mein Plan nimmt jetzt Gestalt an wie der T-1000
Stagetime, die Bassline, sie pustet dich weg
Also nehmt die Hände hoch wie beim Security-Check
Halt die Fresse und red' nicht, wenn die Champions kommen
Sonst gibt es mächtige Drehkicks wie in Eminem-Songs

Klärten uns in Bars Huren
Bis es Tag wurd und mir klar wurd'

Naives, junges Blondchen, das im Bargeld ertrinkt
Heißblütig, freizügig
Jeder Schritt von ihr auf der Gala wirkt leichtfüßig
Der Scheint trügt, Ego kleinwüchsig

Wann war ihr letzter glücklicher Tag?

Schau aus dem Fenster, denk': ""Was geht draußen ab?""
Ich glaub, die Cops observieren mich und steh'n auf'm Dach
Ich weiß, dass diese Scheiße mich nicht weiterbringen wird
Andere hätten diese Kohle schon in' Maybach investiert
Was für Zeug das ist? 'n Kräutermix!
Ich bin ein Luxusdampfer wie 'n Kreuzfahrtschiff
Du bist ziemlich vercrackt, du rauchst ziemlichen Dreck
Bei mir dient das Weed im Pack 'nem medizinischen Zweck
Und so schieß' ich mich weg, pam, beam' mich ins Bett

Ich mach mir so viel Gedanken, gehör' zu den chronisch erkrankten

Ali As,"Alle Gipfel sind erklomm', alle Schritte unternommen
Kein Lebewesen ist der Wissenschaft entkommen
Jeder Fluss wurd' überbrückt, jedes Meer wurd' überquert
Jede Währung ist nichts wert, jeder Fehler wurd' bemerkt
Alle Daten sind auf Chips, alle Fragen sind vom Tisch
Die Geschichtsbücher, sie warten nich' auf dich
Wir jagen durch die Straßen, wenn das Tageslicht erlischt
Alle Stoffe konsumiert, alle Farben sind verwischt
Alle Sterne sind erforscht, alle Werte über Bord
Jede Herde wurd' ermordet und die Erde ist verdorrt
Ich will hier nicht sterben an dem Ort
Sondern mit dir in 'nem Ferienresort
Keine Grenzen im Denken, es war'n schon Menschen im All
Doch wir sind ständig in Kämpfen, rennen in 'nem brennenden Wald
Wir haben keine Namen, wir sind Zahlen im System
Doch mit deinem Strahlen kann ich alle Qualen überstehen

Die Welt ist so groß
Und wir sind so klein
Doch ziehst du mit mir los
Sind wir nicht mehr allein
Nein, wir laufen Richtung Lichtung
Lassen alles hinter uns und dreh'n uns nicht um
Richtung Lichtung
Richtung Lichtung

Alle Rekorde sind geknackt, die Ressourcen werden knapp
Alle Liebeslieder Wurden schon gemacht
Eines Tages wachst du auf und deine Zukunft ist verblasst
Ich hoffe, dass ich ein paar Spuren hinterlass'
Wie soll man im Schatten dieser Wolkenkratzer schein'?
Frage wo sind wir gelandet hier und sollte das so sein?
Alle Codes sind dechiffriert, doch die Rätsel nicht gelöst
Manchmal sind die Wege mysteriös
Alle Meinungen verstummt, alle Hefte sind verstaubt
Jeder König' wurd' gekrönt, alle Paläste sind erbaut
Wir steh'n nicht auf der Gästeliste drauf
Wahrscheinlich sehen wir so wie Extremisten aus
Vorbei die Zeit, in der ich Trauerlieder schreib'
Weil ich - weil ich für dich jede Mauer niederreiß'
Keine Sklaven ohne Namen, keine Zahlen im System
In dein' Armen kann ich jetzt die Sonnenstrahlen wieder sehen

Die Welt ist so groß (groß)
Und wir sind so klein (klein)

Nein, wir laufen Richtung (Richtung) Lichtung (Lichtung)
Lassen alles hinter uns und dreh'n uns nicht um (nicht um)
Richtung Lichtung (Yeah)
Richtung Lichtung

Wir laufen Richtung Lichtung der Sonne hinterher
Wir folgen einem Fluss und später kommen wir ans Meer
Auch wenn du dich fühlst, als wären die Gänge dir zu schmal
Geschieht das nur in deinem Kopf, denn keine Grenzen sind real
Keine Mauer ist zu hoch, keine Trauer ist zu groß
Auch wenn du aufwachst, dein Traum hat sich gelohnt
Keine Aussage verkehrt, keine Aufgabe zu schwer
Die besten Zeiten unerreichbar, doch wir laufen hinterher
Keine Strecke ist zu lang, keine Wege sind zu weit
Keine Pläne sind vergebens, keine Träne, die du weinst
Keine Wünsche, die du hast, deshalb gucken wir nach vorn'
Kein Bild vergessen und kein Puzzlestück verlor'n
Keine Schritte werfen dich zurück, die Richtung ist egal
Kein Schatten bleibt für immer, wenn die Lichtung vor dir strahlt
Alle Wunden sind vergessen, alle Narben sind verheilt
In deinen Armen schlaf' ich wieder ein

Mein Leben ähnelt einem schwachen Drama
Ich mach aus dem B-Movie-Drehbuch wieder ein Kassenschlager
Das Himmelstor ist zu, ich steh aussen vor
Ich nehme zwei E's, schon wird ein Meer aus dem Moor
Die ganzen Niederlagen tun gar nicht weh
Ich mach ein Lied aus dem Leid, indem ich die Buchstaben dreh
Hab meine Wut abgelegt, lass die Löwen kämpfen
Sollen die anderen Sprüche klopfen, so wie Höhlenmenschen
Ich will nicht wie 'n Kegel durch das Leben taumeln
Eher nehm' ich mir 'nen Strick und lass die Seele baumeln
Galgenhumor durchzieht meinen Lebenslauf
Ich sehe nie wieder schwarz, nicht mal mit Ray-Ban auf

Ich schalt den Nebel aus, sehe besser, start den Mähdrescher
Mach den Großstadtdschungel platt - bis auf die Kleeblätter

Meine Ex war 'ne Zehn, hab mich lebendig begraben
Ab jetzt kommen paar Elfen vor, wie in Fantasy-Sagen
Man spürt nur Frost, wenn einen der Frust wieder frisst
Man ist zwar Lost, doch aus der Last wird 'ne Lust mit 'ner List
Die ganzen Märchen sind nur künstlicher Müll
Weil der Gin aus der Flasche mir keine Wünsche erfüllt
Ich zahl die Roten in Raten, pflanze Rosen im Rasen
Die Vorsätze sind tot, ich mach die Toten zu Taten
Bricht das Dach der Welt über mei'm Kopf zusammen
Ich flecht' jede Pechsträhne zu 'nem Hoffnungsstrang

Doch wenn Heino stirbt, seht ihr uns nicht beim Trauermarsch

Ich bin der letzte Künstler hier, der seine Fans nie anlügt
Denn schau, ich komm aus einer Gegend, wo kein Enzian blüht
Ich kann die heile Welt hier nicht sehen
Keine Weizenfelder und Seen
Keine Helden und Feen
Ich sah meine Eltern in Tränen
Hatte Albino-Augen
Weil ich anfing', Weed zu rauchen
Ließ nie Heino-Songs in der Siedlung laufen
Weil wir für die Heimat ein Visum brauchten
Lieder, die Spießer hier Hits nenn'
Spiegeln nicht wider, was ich denk
Er hat zig Fans und ein' Bekanntheitsgrad
Der mir Angst einjagt
Obwohl ich die besseren Punchlines hab
Weiß ich nicht, ob mich mein Landkreis mag
Ich bin noch lang kein Star
Ich geb euch mal eben die Bankleitzahl

Doch staubgrau ist die Straßenschlucht
Von hier aus kann ich keine Berggipfel sehen

Freiwild, weil das Geschrei meinen Vibe killt
Parolen sind laut, Meinungen stumm
Hier werden Lieder von Heino gesungen
Vielleicht mach ich auch keine zeitlose Kunst
Und such Streit ohne Grund
Doch ich weiß, meine Songs werden von Kids auf dem iPhone gepumpt
Was für Schlagermusik, wir hören Schlägermusik
Mittelfinger an die Fake-Industrie
Ekelerregende Melancholie
Nichtssagend wie ein Autistenkind

Er springt von 'nem Viehwagon
Unsichtbar für die, die entgegen kommen
Griff in den Mandarinenkarton und schnell weg von hier
Den Touri am Eck fixiert
Ungefragt den Dreck von seinen Schuhen poliert
Nur für vier Dirham
In der Urlaubssaison boomen die Geschäfte hier
Hat die glänzende Rolex fest im Visier
Wenn er 'nen Blick durch das offene Fenster wirft
Sich geschickt an das offene Fenster pirscht
Noch bevor irgendwer irgendetwas hört

Kurz atmet er durch
Über den Dächern der Stadt

Kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen
Und er rennt, wenn sie kommen
Kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen

Und sie jagen ihm hinterher, flink wie er ist
Zwingt er sich durch einen Schlitz und tritt in Scherben
Unterdrückt den Schmerz, um nicht zu schreien
Er hinkt weiter, um nicht gekriegt zu werden
Und er duckt sich
Die Polizei kommt, er nimmt ältere Leute als Schutzschild
Bis er umkippt, Schlag eins, Schlag zwei
Die Touristen geschockt, aber tun nix
Denn er schadet dem Stadtbild
Er ist nur ein Straßenkind, das zu jung für den Knast ist
Erst stellt er sich tot
Und wenn der eine Moment kommt, reißt er sich los

Versteckt im Schatten der Nacht

Traurige Szenen im staubigen Licht
An die jüngeren Touris verkaufen sie Haze
Die Älteren sieht er in Audi TT's
Oder sitzen im Ritz für die Straußen-Filets
Und es wird ihm bewusst
Sein Traum war verweht in der flirrenden Luft

In ’nem Land, in dem die Straßen tiefe Risse haben
Kinder nichts im Magen, Bilder malen in tristen Farben
Wo sie Kaugummis verkaufen wollen, die sie in Kisten tragen
Wo sie mit Knochen spielen und in trüben Flüssen baden
Da, wo die, die herrschen, kein Gewissen haben
An Lehmhütten vorbeirauschen im Business-Wagen
Nie zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden für die Missetaten
Während deren Handlanger die Waffen von den Schiffen laden
Zig Milliarden Storys, hier ist eine davon

Wo sich der Gastgeber nur selten zu den Gästen gesellt

Weil das Schicksal es so wollte, dass sich Wege trafen
Zwei Boote angespült wurden im Ehehafen
Und meine Eltern alles für ein neues Leben gaben
Sich für eine Zukunft entschieden und doch daneben lagen
Schichtarbeiten nur für die Sicherheiten
Funkstille für Jahre, keiner von den beiden bricht das Schweigen
Wie sie ihr Leiden nicht mal zeigen und Zeugen gibt’s nicht
Außer mich, geboren neunzehn neunundsiebzig

Von der Erde zum Mond, noch sind die Sterne zu hoch

Meine Homies bestimmen den Dope-Preis
Du kommst rein, wenn du weißt, wie der Code heißt

Wenn ich komme, läuft der Mission-Impossible-Theme
Bin der Boss in dem Team mit dem Stoff in den Jeans
Bin der, der tolerant mit jedem Mensch redet
Es sei denn, er trägt Camp David
Julien Assange mit ’nem cooleren Teint
Mit ’nem Style, der seinesgleichen sucht wie Schwule in Bars
Will nach Fort Knox und hinterlasse Mordopfer

Yo, du kannst die Emotionen in jedem Song fühlen
Ich bring’ die Platten aus'm Block als würd’ ich Mahjong spielen
Bin nur einer von denen, über die andere sagen
Mann die verpassen mit Sicherheit das Saisonziel
Und läufst du vor, wollen dir alle den Ball nehmen
Das wie ’n Tor alle wollen dich fallen sehen
Und trotz alldem, ah ah, Misstrauen
Siehst du mich mit Schmuck behangen wie ’n Christbaum, im VIP-raum
Mit zig Frauen wie Chris Brown, doch tanz’ nicht, Kickdown bis 320
Zeig’ es allen wie ein Exibitionist
Check’ die Videoclips, Bitch
Bleib für ewig jung und ihr erlebt ein Wunder
Mittelfinger auf Viagra, er geht nicht runter

Früher war ich geplagt von Zweifeln im Nacken
Heute komm’ ich mit Pelzmantel und Mütze zur Show
Und das bedeutet, ihr seht mich mit zwei Fellen im Nacken
Unantastbar, ihr Hunde macht Platz da
Ich habe Depressionen überwunden wie Pflaster ach ja
Es ist für ein Update nie zu spät
Zeit, dass ich am Rad dreh’ wie Groupiers
Die feine Elite lässt einen nie an Bord
Während sich die Klinge des Wartens in deine Nieren bohrt
Doch ich gebe nichts auf die und gebe nicht auf
Und halte meine Herde eng, so wie ein Viehtransport
Heißt ich grind’ die meisten Tage fulltime
Bleib im kleinsten Kreis wie ’n Dart im Bullseye
Kids schreien „King“ und mein’ mich jetzt

Hoes werden geshootet wie auf Pressebildern der Hefner-Villa

Man kann mich mit profitieren sehen wie Filmhundetrainer
Majestätische Kleider, hier geht es nicht weiter

Weil sie in mir den Schuldigen sehen
Würd’ ich mich an die Gesetze hier halten, dann wäre ich ein Leben lang null entertaint

So viele Feinde, ich hole mir ein’ Munitionsvorrat, der für paar Monate reicht, ah
Und ich lade grad nach, ah
Hater schlagen Alarm
Kugeln, die Schuhe durchlöchern, bis deine Boots aussehen als wären sie Gartensandalen

Ihr seht die Misanthropen in Dries van Noten
Chillen kaum, View ist himmelblau, ja, wir sind in Town, so wie Seemannsknoten

Russo Baltique oder Fabergé-Eier, ein Wodka mit Soda

In den Kissen gehortet, in dicken Tresoren und in Reebokkartons
Du fragst, Was hat deine Bitch hier verloren?“ Die Contenance!
Aber fall' mir noch einmal mitten ins Wort und du fliegst von Balkons
Selfmade, self-played, well-paid, on-fire Hellgate
Reflektiere das Bosslife wie die Cazal Shades in den Hills von L.A.
Fick aufs Rapgame, das ist Klassikmusik, so wie Bachsymphonien
Im Wandtresor hunderte Klunker gebunkert, sie funkeln im Dunkeln wie Asteroide
Ich geb' Ali As Steroide, schick' ihm noch 'ne Gratishantel
Und zack ist der Ali Kante wie die Stadt in Spanien, Schlampe
Voller Blutrunst, du denkst, du bist die Zukunft Trugschluss
Yo, wir spüren dich auf per Suchhund, Junge, und stehen dann bei dir auf der Matte wie'n Grußspruch
Ballern dich voll, bis du Blut spuckst, ohne Waffenschein
Drei Minuten später sieht man uns gemütlich Earl Grey trinken mit dem kleinen Finger abgespreizt

Sie ließen mich zurück während eines Antarktiktrips

Gold um meinen Hals so wie ein Spitzensportler
Statt Chicken Korma, ah, nur Fiji Water

Wie im Hollywood-Drama
Hänge allein in der Lobby vom Plaza, yeah
Die anderen gehen mit dem Promis zur Gala, ich nich'!
Ich bleibe alleine und mache mich für deren Fotzengelaber und Gossip unnahbar
Es ist Payback, baller sie weg wie ein Hazepack
Denkt irgendwann mal an mich wenn bei euch dann die Zahlen nach unten gehen 
Und kleiner werden so wie bei den Tafeln für Sehtests
Realtitätscheck
Bei mir herrscht Aufbruchsstimmung, denn ich knack alleine den Safe jetzt
Fick deren Almosen, wir sehen uns bald oben
Wenn dann mein Konto mit Moos eingedeckt ist als wär' es ein Vietcong auf Waldboden
Hochmütigkeit ist ne' Bitch, die jeder fickt, aber keine mehr zurückruft
Denn in 'ner Welt, in der jeder sein Glück sucht, wovon neunzig Prozent aber nix tun
Außer Bitchmoves
Sie sind gewaltbereit und kalt wie Eis
Aber mein Verstand ist wie die Unterseite eines Schlittschuhs
Ich bin auf ei'm Steven Seagal
Bereit für den riesigen Knall
Ich hab' Familienhalt und lasse mir nichts mehr von niemand gefallen

Dieses Game hier ist ein Stunden-Hotel
Keine Liebe mehr in unserer Welt
Ich drifte mit dem Wagen nach Haus
Und cruise zurück zur hundertundelf
Ich cruise zurück zur hundertundelf
Cruise zurück zur hundertundelf
Ich cruise zurück zur hundertundelf
Cruise zurück zur hundertundelf

Ich hoffe, ich bin irgendwann mal im Reinen mit allem
Und auch, wenn es keinem gefallen wird, ich schulde keinem mehr einen Gefallen
Allein gegen alle, ich lasse jetzt keinen mehr rein in die heiligen Hallen
Kein Origamikünstler, doch ich mache nichts anderes, als Scheine zu krallen
Ah, yeah, bitte rede nicht mehr so mit mir
Als ob ich noch der gleiche Drizzy-Drake-Biter von vier Jahren wär
On fire wie Crack aufm Gasherd
Hatte keinerlei Plan mehr
Lebte Anonym wie Kronzeugen, war ein Phantom wie ein Rolls Royce
Oder Ghost so wie ein Rolls Royce 
Auch beim Old boys Shit, heute am Ballen wie Großkreutz
Ich hab' noch Chardonnay da, Sneaker in Camoleder
Pst, bitte, denn mich dissen wird ins Auge gehen wie Tornadojäger
Vom White-Label zum Black-Label, sieben Tage die Woche wie Craig David

Yeah, ich wollt' nur mit dir reden, ah
Und hoffe, ah

Mein Leben ist im Cherokee Jeep fahren auf den Serpentinenstraßen
So high, als würd' ich einfach keine Erdanziehung haben
Anders könnt' ich diese Schmerzen nie ertragen
Die erste Liebe hat mein Herz verziert mit Narben
Weil die Menschen keine Wärme mehr verstrahlen
Wie das Sperrgebiet der Tschernobylanlagen
Uns gehören die Sterne, die sie jagen
Willst du Perspektiven haben oder Nervenklinikschaden?
Unser Spielplatz ist jetzt braches Land
Spuren verlaufen sich im schwarzen Sand
Denn auch Pioniere enden in 'ner Pathologie
Bis dahin bauen wir eine kleine Marskolonie

Ich hab' Angst vorm freien Fall ins weite All
Wir waren der Zielgerade nie so nah
Lieblingsfarbe tiefes Schwarz, denn wir sind bipolar
Sind in 'nem Strudel und verschwinden im Nu
Nichts ist für ewig, kein infinity pool
Für Demut sind wir zu cool
Aber alle werden gläubig auf dem Hinrichtungsstuhl
Wo sehen sie sich in hundert Jahren?
Irgendwo als Geist in unsrer Umlaufbahn
Lasst uns versuchen, dass der Spirit bleibt
Denn alleine irr' ich weiter als ein Bug durch diese Wirklichkeit

Und pseudo-deepen Weisheiten in heultriefender Schreibweise
Stoff für die Tumblr-Blogs, Durchhalteparolen für die Underdogs
Doch das hier wird ein andrer Stoff
Ich blicke auf die Zeiger in ihrem Rundgang im goldenen Gefängnis
Hoff' mein Name trägt die Zahl zur Berechnung von dem Umfang des Kreises
Wenn unser Ende droht, werden wir häufig noch einmal gläubig
Und ändern uns noch schnell mal wie den Handycode
Löschen unsern Chatverlauf, hoffen, wir sind rein gewaschen
Werden in weißgemachten Leinensachen hereingelassen
Ins Paradies, Paranoia vor der Alternative
Doch von oben gesehen, sind wir alle nur Parasiten
Parallelen sind nur möglich in der Mathematik
Wir sind Patronen aus der Waffenfabrik, krachen ins Ziel
Zerplatzen in die Atome, werden wieder neu zusammengesetzt
Werden Personen in ei'm anderen Text

Ich drifte, ich drifte

Auch wenn wir uns wie'n Bumerang verbiegen
Landen wir wieder am Punkt, an dem wir uns grade verlieren
Wir probieren Funkempfang zu kriegen
Doch rasen im Sekundenschlaf der Tunnelwand entgegen
Stumm wie Pantomimen ist der Widerstand
Die Mienen starr, wir schreien die Menschen, die wir lieben an
Unsre Feinde lachen uns an aus dem Spiegelschrank
Wir werfen Dynamit in' Wald und jetzt steht der Kamin in Flammen

Und nun sind die intimen Stunden allesamt Termingebunden
Erinnerungen liegen unten tief im Dunklen
Für die Bergung, hol dir eine Staffel von Lawinenhunden
Du brauchst kein Schlüssel zu mei'm Herz, sondern einen Eiscrusher
Die Glücksmomente ziehen vorbei im Zeitraffer
In einer Welt, in der nichts heilig bleibt
Schmeckt deine Pussy fast wie Weihwasser
Dünner Rauch steigt noch morgens aus den Trümmern auf
Die Rosen auf den namenlosen Gräbern sehen verkümmert aus
Suchten einen Unterschlupf, fanden in unserm Bunker Schutz
Während das Feld um uns herum in einen Sumpf abrutscht

Zum Businesstermin
In zerrissenen Jeans

Hand in hand they pass me by 
Wish I was one of them 
Wish I had somebody 

Wakin' up beside me 
Looking into my eyes at night 
I want a love to call my own 
I want someone that I can hold 

Want someone wanting me 
want to feel how it feels to be

Somebody's somebody 
Somebody's someone 
Some sweet lover's lover 
I want to be that one 
Someone faithful to someone faithful 
Someone kind to someone kind to me 
Somebody to somebody who loves me 
Who loves me 

Spending all of my time 
Spending all my time on me 
Where is that someone who 
I can give my time to 

Searching for that lover 
With the love that will change my life 
I want two arms to hold me close 
I want the thing I need most 

Somebody needing me 
So I can feel how it feels to be 

[Chorus]

What I'm looking for 
Is someone to love me more 
Than I've been loved before 
With love so right 

What I need to find 
Is someone to hold me tight 
What I mean is i want to be

Das Arschloch wird nicht schöner, je länger du drauf schaust
Freezy und auf meiner nächsten CD
Werden mehr Ärsche gefickt als beim CSD
Ey yo was für ne Welt, oder?
Du denkst an nichts böses, dann meldet sich der Japse von Hangover
Kanax rappen über Ehrenhaftigkeiten
Kleiner Tipp, wie wäre es mit Seife, ihr ekelhaften Schweine
Das einzige was ich noch beweisen muss
Ist ob deine Mutter lutscht durch den Reißverschluss
Was du rappst juckt im Block keine Sau
Sex findet im Kopf statt, im Kopf deiner Frau
Meine Lederhose sagt, der König der Kanacken
Deine Trainingshose sagt, bitte geh dich öfter waschen

Doch unterschrieb bei der Firma, die Umsatz macht wie Adidas
Von wem wurd'st du an den Straßen abends angemacht?
Wähl die 110 und sag den Bullen „Ali war's!“

From brief encounters, habits grow
Into giant oaks that hide the sun
Life in the shadows ain't no fun

It's easy getting up there
Never think of coming down

When you're floating on a cloud
But you know that lonely feeling
When nothing's going right
'Cause it's only the beginning
Of a cold and sleepless night

You could meet somebody, you never know
From brief encounters, habits grow
Into giant oaks that hide the sun
Your only chance is to turn and run

It's harder getting up there
And it's painful coming down 
And now you can't see clearly
Beneath the thunder cloud
And the loneliness gets longer
When nothing's going right
And things ain't getting any better
With another sleepless night

But I know they cry not in vain.
Now the times are changin';
Love has come to bloom again.

Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
Reminds us of youthful days.
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops,
But the sweat from man's brow;
The substance from our spine.
We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time:
Hallelujah time!

Yes, you can hear the children singing: hallelujah time!
As they go singing by and by: hallelujah time!
Oh, ""hallelujah"" singing in the morning.
Hallelujah time! let them sing; don't let them cry.

Over rocks and mountains
The sheep are scattered all around.
Over hills and valleys,
They are everywhere to be found.
But though we bear our burdens now,
All afflictions got to end somehow:
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough.

Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free like birds in a tree.

Hallelujah time! yes, you can hear the children singing.
Hallelujah time! yes, as they go singing by and by.

They will shut you up  
And you got no one to blame  
 
[Chorus]

There's a rat in me kitchen 
  
When you out on the street,  
You practice lies and deceit  
And you scandalize my name  
But when I catch you up  
I'm gonna pull you up  
I'm gonna check-out inside your brain  
  
[Chorus]

When yo deh pon the scene,  
You make everyone scream  
Because they know your so unjust  
But when they catch you up  
They will kick you up  
Because you someone they cannot trust  
  
[Chorus]

You invade my space  
Make me feel disgraced  
And you just don't give a damn  
If I had my way  
If I had my say  
I'd like to see you hang

Makes me forget that I
Still need you so

But memories won't go
No, memories won't go

I'd have thought that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head

Just one thing makes me forget

Don't let me be alone

You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Life in the shadows ain't no fun  
  
It's easy getting up there  
Never think of coming down  
Not hard to say 'I want you'  
When you're floating on a cloud  
But you know that lonely feeling  
When nothing's going right  
'Cause it's only the beginning  
Of a cold and sleepless night  

[Chorus]  

You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run  
  
It's harder getting up there  
And it's painful coming down  
And now you can't see clearly  
Beneath the thunder cloud  
And the loneliness gets longer  
When nothing's going right  
And things ain't getting any better  
With another sleepless night

[ VERSE 1: Ali Dee ]
Breaker breaker, send you to the undertaker
The rapper that's comin to take ya 
Cause I shake ya like a Laker
Whether knockin boots, shootin hoops, alley hoops
Ali Dee's hoop funk follow your nose for these here Fruit Loops
You bite like bats if you heard me rap
Drop somethin fat on a track and take on thirty cats, you dirty rats
So here we go, yell Geronimo
Then pass up a hiney, yo
The flow will make you feel like a tiny hoe
I grand-slam like I'm Van Damme
Act like a lumberjack, in fact the track will slam like a Rams fan
You suck so much you need a nipple
I squeeze a trigger, squeeze a Charmin and I cripple Mr. Whipple
And triple any rapper runnin his trapper tryin to kick it 
Pull a pump out on a chump and make him jump like Jiminy Cricket
Flippin it like a page until the damn stage is torn
So bring it on, kid, bring it on

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2: cool G Rap ]
Send in the fire engines cause G Rap is startin fires
Rappers are jumpin like Evil Knievel
You better believe it, I'm comin like Michael Myers
So run and go hide as I get rid of the ones that hid
But on the lid what I did was, ""Yo honey, I blew up the kids""
My broom's not singin the blues, so bring on the crews that try to do me
I'm skimpy like ?Kimpy?, snappy like Daffy and yahoowee!
See, I disrespects em, indeed I disrespect her
Your damn Sam Goody's record makes me laugh like Woody Pecker
Got price on hot mics so your spotlights are dimmin
Lyrics are fatter than women's that you see with Richard Simmons
So back up, don't act up, just be on some good behaviour
You thought it was Lifesavers, the flavor I just gave ya
In fact I pack a disco, my lyrics are slicker than Crisco
Give thrills from Blueberry Hill down to the streets of San Franscico
Like Tabasco I'm hot, if I want to get ripple go sip on a Cisco
You hookey-playin rookies like they cookies from Nabisco
I shake it, I bake it, I take it to the break of, break of dawn
So bring it on, sucker, bring it on

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3: Ali Dee ]
I make examples out of suckers that I trample
Givin plenty lumps to them chumps, I'm a champ
Here's a sample, I catch flashbacks while I smash tracks
Then I blast stacks of wack and sad sack rappers get your ass waxed
Frontin get you nothin but a coffin
I bother your father and bring the drama to your mama, make your ass an orphan
I put some lead inside your head, you're dead and gone
So bring it on, trooper, bring it on

Ali Haurand,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1993
Ali Haurand,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1997
Ali Haurand,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And there was even postage due

And then it had to be with you

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Mera vird hai dam dam Ali Ali – My worship and upon my breath is the name of Ali.
Saqi Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with the beloved Qalander
Jhoole Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with Jhoole Laal who is intoxicated with Qalander
Aakhi Ja Malanga Akhi Ja Malanga – Keep repeating his name you follower of Ali
Tu Ali Ali Ali Akhi Ja Malanga – You Ali !!! Keep saying his name.


These lyrics mirror exactly the name of the Qawwal – to be in intoxication “Mast”.

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

So fast forward to the future
Where the youth them are a-changing

They're hearts blazing
Can't nobody tell 'em nothing

This ain't right, fuss and fight
Don't you roll, it's so cold
What's your mold, will he break or will he fold?
They on him, they want him, the homie Stoney
In love with his girl and so is his big homie
Now what a pity, a footnote to the cutthroat, it's rare
See, I was told all in love is unfair
One fee, one fare, done there
Fishing, dishing, and wishing upon air
Vision beyond years
Damn, people always pushing the wrong way
See my advice to the homie Stoney
Is do it your own way, the long way
And hear what the song say
Together, forever, forever, together, you dig?
See, this what it's supposed to boast
And get close and be with the one that you truly love the most
It's destiny

The past is an illusion, there is only now

They already move planets and moons
The plan is to vanish and move
Flip a townhouse down south pow wows with the gals
Out bound fishing boat where the city folks sip and smoke
Then these folks pushing the envelope
Which extended hope to a inner-most impulse
His desire for a child undisclosed

Deep inside a fire took hold
The moment that the plot was shown
Visions of intermingled souls
Matching afros, juleps on a creaky porch
Life at a slower tempo
No regulations to encroach upon their relations cantankerous kinfolks, be damned
If they can't accept us then we gonna scram

(Can't hide the way that I'm feeling for you
My emotions can't be concealed, I was in love
And together you and I will show the world, I wanted him to be the only one
Our love is for real, I was in love)

Heard some more shots in the distance I'm looking for an exit
Two girls I saw up in the club rode up and told me, ""Get in""

I heard the muffler and now I'm running for some cover
Some suckers put they ride in reverse and burned rubber
Got me flustered, I'm like, ""Oh brother, there goes the summer""

Can you get back up when you're feeling hurt

Days go by, does life feel like a revolving door 
You changed your mind, you may not feel like it did before 
Just takes some time, to realize that 
Walking out the door could take you somewhere
You've never been before 
You've never been before, no no 

Can you break down but still be strong 
When you disagree can you get along 
When life doesn't meet your great expectations

Do you see yourself or who you want to be 
Do you live up to your great expectations

Along the empty streets last night
Hanging around
With hair-dos like mine
No I haven't seen the kids for some time

Picked up her shoes from the red brick stairway
Just like a harpsichordist she moves
And back upstairs at half past two
With a paper folded outside the loo

Rain falls like Elvis' tears
Oh no, no sugar tonight
Out on the high street
Dim all the lights and
Cry coloured tears again

Ali Vegas,"This is a journey into the worlds most largest
And notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most
Cowardest rappers

[Nas]
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like telling some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his names Cory
Hung around my mans Like and Big Trevor
Trevors still locked up, Likes getting his cheddar
Cory changed his name to arr, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat lookalike, its Mega
Right Mega was his name sorry about that
But its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing
But thats Nas always looking out for breadrin
Cause when brethren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughing to the bank and shit
Back to Cor, got him a deal but his rhymes was whack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch you from around the way its sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Chorus x2]
They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

[Nas]
Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies
Mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies
Theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arther and Knight Sir Lance-A-Lot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what nigga you're butt and it got back to me
Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You aint from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.
Nature moved to Marcy
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy
Back with ass niggas in fear
Fuck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we aint friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Chorus]

[Nas]
I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P how many times aint you shamed that
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back
They dont respect you a checks due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm saying your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position cause you'll never be king
Even Jigga want the crown, ?? poor thing
I'm representing Queensbridge U.S.A.
Where two sk's go off every day new flesh lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

[Chorus]

[Talking]
The bridge is over my dick, Bridge'll never be over
Long as I'm alive and breathing, Braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm saying, just get them unloyal niggas
From out your circle, you can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga
Be untouchable my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real
And thats real, ayo Nature I can't hold your hand through this shit man
I'm not your father man, be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself nigga or dont even rep this
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta? Theres real gangsta
Shit going on in the streets man, yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man? Niggas be bucking
Why you never bucking, where you be at man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin Neo Brown of the fucking hood
Its disgusting man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherfucking mouth
Theres no more room for jealousy, we destroying and rebuilding
That means the cowards get out and the real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine, shining
with suede motherfucking balles on in silks
I'ma always be the young don, dont be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggas in Queensbridge
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby

Aliados de la Sierra,"Todos quieren que me olvide de ella
Que es de lo peor y no me quiere bien
Dicen que me envuelve el cerebro
Con al fin de enredarse en mi cuerpo
Debo confesar que cuando ella me besa
El mundo da vueltas dentro de mi cabeza
Cierro los ojos y siento su aliento
Mi sangre quema cualquier pensamiento
y le creo, le creo, le creo
Le creo cuando dice te quiero
Le creo que es la mujer mas buena
Le creo que la luna es de queso
y si el me diera otro beso
Que mas da si me miente
Yo le creo

Con los ojos cerrados iré tras de ella
Con los ojos cerrados siempre le amare
Con los ojos cerrados yo confió en ella

Y nunca te dejare chiquitita!
No me importa lo que digan!!
Y échele y échele mis aliados de la sierra

Aliados de la Sierra,"No es ninguna aberración sexual
Pero me gusta verte andar en cueros
El compas de tus pechos aventureros
Víctimas de la gravedad

Será porque
No me gusta la tapicería
Creo que tú desnudez
Es tú mejor lencería

Por eso es que
Me gustas tal y como eres
Incluso ese par de libras de más
Si te viese tú jefe desnuda y detrás

No dudaría en promover tú cintura
Deja llenarme de tú desnudez
Para afrontar los disfraces de afuera
De una mejor manera

Desnuda que no habrá diseño
Que te quede mejor
Que el de tú piel ajustada a tú figura
Desnuda que no hay un ingenuo

Que vista una flor
Sería como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda que la naturaleza
No se equivoca
Y sí te hubiese querido con ropa

Con ropa hubieses nacido
Deja llenarme de tú desnudez
Para vestirme por dentro
Aunque sea un momento

Y desnudos nos entendemos
Mejor mamacita
Échele bonito mis
Aliados de la sierra

Y ahora que por fin te tengo así
Desnuda y precisamente enfrente
Desnuda también un poquito la mente
Pon tus complejos junto a tú ropa

Y sí te sientes un poquito loca
Pues ponte loca completa
Que verte será solo el inicio
Antes de perder el juicio

Desnuda que no habrá diseño
Que te quede mejor
Que el de tú piel ajustada a tú figura

Desnuda que no hay un ingenuo
Que vista una flor
Sería como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda que la naturaleza no se equivoca

Y sí te hubiese querido con ropa
Con ropa hubieses nacido
Deja llenarme de tú desnudez
Para vestirme por dentro

Porque secretamente vienes y vas?
No dejas huellas pero se que estas

Va te faire foutre toi Kamelancien, Houssni, flow à la Ben Laden
94 nous tester ? Mec c'est pas la peine
On zigzague, 187 sur la zik zinc
Mec je suis zinzin, j'écris mes textes à Bagdad
Une grenade venue tout droit d'Al Kaïda
9.4 plus 9.3 arrête de jouer le caïd là
Tu revois ta vie, ex-voleur de ture-voi t'as vu
Je connais pas ta vie, mais je la reconnais sur ta vue
Kamelancien, j'arrive terrifiant
Les keufs pieds au plancher arrivent vérifiant
Face aux warriors, l'ancien Rohff te met hors-piste
Pronostique une boucherie comme dit-on hors diss
Si ton rap c'est de l'argent, le notre c'est de l'or fils
En fait moi j'ai rien à foutre d'être artiste
Tu parles trop, à croire que tu vas tout brûler
Avec du whisky dans la pêche, je te baise ta race toi et ton couplet
J'ai pas le temps pour ces putes qui tiennent le micro comme une bite
Ici ça rap comme ça tire, et brise tes os comme une batte
Département mes couilles, qu'est-ce tu crois, toi et ton crew
Dans la rue c'est pour de vrai, si tu blagues tu prends des coups
Merde, pose le micro on va te le rentrer dans le boule
Gros mytho t'as pas de vécu ferme ta gueule tu nous saoule
9.3 - 9.4 code 187 l'automatique pour les grosses putes habituées à faire du zèle
Je parle peu, quand je l'ouvre c'est qu'on m'a pas payé
Gros zoulou si tu t'en sors c'est que mon arme s'est enrayée
Change de putes, change de potes, change de porte, change d'époque
Pok pok popopok, tire ou pose à terre ton glock
Au refrain
C'est crime molotov, nique ton père en lover
Come over, je move, dans l'cockpit R.O.H.2.F
Carnivore sur la viaux arrache tes enfants, t'es fou
Je les ai vu, toi tu creuses ça c'est la vie

T'es ou ? ah t'es là(cric) prends ton souffle(cric)
J'ai bicrave ton masque à gaz (cric) et voilà que je te gaze (cric)
187 code criminel, troué à l'opinel
T'es mort VIP direction la morgue tu rigoles (kr kr kr)
T'as trop maig-( kr kr kr ) à force de moque-( kr kr)
Je t'ai taillé un sourire commercial
Grouille demande au petit frère c'est qui qu'a buter Hitler
Ils te répondront : Scarface dedans est le cerveau
Ouvre les portières fait péter le son
À l'unisson nous dansons
Pour te localiser j'offre une rançon
Je roule en première, pépère !
Ça klaxonne derrière, nique sa mère, c'est la rue à mon père
Et hop ! j'accélère dès que je te vois traverser
Oh ! je t'ai pas vu, excuse de t'avoir renversé
Je suis pas DMX, je vais verser, pas essuyer ce beat
T'aurais aimé kicker sur ce beat putain t'es qu'un suce bite
Ça collerait pas, sois logique c'est simple
Bouffon mets pas du 6.35 dans un colt 45
Donc cesse de me parler de tess, de 16,
D'équipe, de tass, de guez, de rabz, de calibre car je te baise
Sous gingembre, du genre une balle dans la jambe
Pas de sécu, on risque de me tirer une balle dans la jambe
Prêt à dégainer, j'ai du sang sur les mains en guise de henné
Donc cesse de te gonfler t'es "" éné "", regarde comment on fait
Ton hardcore c'est du toc, ton flow sature
Mes rimes traversent les époques comme mes balles traversent les murs
Yo man ! tu rapes comme une tortue, tes fond te tord en tunes
M'écouter pour toi c'est tordu
Terroriste lyrics, c'est Ben Laden qu'a fait ce son de bâtard
Maquetter au Pakistan, l'âgé c'est le Mola Omar

Alice Babs,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Alice Cooper,"But over in a land that's in my back yard
There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard

Well, they found a way to live with ease
By eating from the bush instead of the trees

Apple bush, apple tree
Path to eternity
Find you a path and you follow the call

Apple bush, apple tree
Back to eternity
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall

Well, over in a corner, standing there
Telling my house that they haven't a single care

But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own
Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone

If you cut this new path well the old one will do
and you live with the people who live with ease

Just fearing that I will accept the ideal

Baby, baby, for the rest of my life
I'm trying and dying
Maybe, maybe`s tryin' be my life

Come to see you every day now if I can
Is it not the time for everybody?

Why then don't the night show really matters
If we dwell in the fields of regret

When the approaching judge shall find
What sinful deeds from all mankind

With death and nature in surprise
Behold the wretched sinners rise
To meet the judge's searching eyes

And when the doomed no more can flee
From the flames of misery
Assist me while I die

Alice Cooper,"I met an alley cat
Pussyfootin' around
Till the break of dawn
Found me knocked out flat on my head

Some feline beauty
Waved her tail my way
I just had to stay
I couldn't get the blood off my hands
She made my eyes bug out
Her tail stand up
And, I ain't even in heat for a month

House cat, you really got it made
Sleepin' all night and perfect delight of day

Some feline beauty
Waved her tail my way
I just had to stay
I couldn't get the blood off my bed
She made my eyes bug out
Her tail stand up
And I ain't even in heat for a month

Some bad cats from fourth street
Come down to our alley
Well, we say that's cool
But just stay away from me and my boys

Eyes clash and claws slash
And green-eyed fur goes flyin'
Midnight, cat fight, neck bite
Die

When you're a jet
You're a jet all the way
From your first cigarette
Till your last dyin' day
When you're a jet
Let 'em do what they can
Little boy, you got friends
You're a family man

The jets are in gear
They're always well respected
You're never alone
When company's expected
You're well protected
Here come the jets
Like a bat out of Hell
Someone gets in our way
Someone don't feel so well
When you're a jet
You stay a jet

I wonder if it could be me

Wake me gently, just touch my hand 
Wake me gently, pull my sleeve

Laid out on satin sheets

We just burned down the church
While the choir within sang religious songs
And it's not like we thought we was right
We just played with the wheels of a passenger train
That cracked on the tracks one night
It's not like we ain't on the ball
We just talk to our shrinks
Huh, they talk to their shrinks
No wonder we're up the wall
We're not stupid or dumb
We're the lunatic fringe who rusted the hinge
On Uncle Sam's daughters and sons
Good old boys and girls
Congregating, waiting in another world
With roller coaster brains
Imagine playing with trains
Good old boys and girls
Congregating, waiting in some other world
We're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy
Lizzy Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks
And don't think we're trying to be bad
All the innocent crime seemed alright at the time
Not necessarily mad, not necessarily mad
We watch every day for the bus
And the driver would say
""That's where lunatics stay""
I wonder if he's talking about us
It's not like we're vicious or gone
We just dug up the graves where your relatives lay
In old forest lawn
And it's not like we don't know the score
We're the fragile elite they dragged off the street
I guess they just couldn't take us no more

Being in love is crazy not alone that way

God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us

To events of a night long ago
Driving alone with our guilt well concealed
In the trunk of your '68 Olds

But you know and I know our passion's
Not deformed it's true to say

And I don't want them growing inside me
They're no price for the love that we have

Oh Billie it's fresh in my memory
The night that it had to be done
You with your pick axe and scissors
And you with your shovel and gun

All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies
Guess love makes you do funny things

I got my scriptures and my wires crossed
I got no kids, and I got no home

Since I've been here for a little stay
I see Rozetta day by day
She turns my head, makes me cough
I want to tear my collar off

I just can't sleep at night
Rozetta dressed in white
She's got the Devil's light
Shining in her eyes

Screamed my sermon damning sin and vice
When underneath I was a regular guy
My pulpit melted like a block of ice
When a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky

From my stretcher, when they wheeled me in
I stared directly in the eyes of sin
Nurse Rozetta, standing over me
And I was helpless as a man of God could be

Nurse Rozetta; I won't let her
Catch me peering down her sweater
Fantasizing silk suspender on her thighs
Nurse Rozetta make me better

Secretly my eyes undress her
Let me feel your tongue depressor
I'm suddenly twice my size
My pants are all wet inside

She's so creative with a bar of soap
And so inventive with a stethoscope
To check my pulse, she gotta hold my hand
I blow the fuse on the encephalogram

Satan sent her from the bowels of hell
I should have recognized old Jezebel
I surrendered to the urges felt
She popped the buckle on my bible belt

I just can't sleep at night
Rozetta dressed in white
She's got the Devil's light

They've got this place
Where they've been keeping me
Where I can't hurt myself
I can't get my wrists to bleed

Is sterilized and white

With just a moth stained naked night

Plastic forks and spoon
No laces in my shoes

Outside the Quiet Room

This quiet place
It ain't so new to me
It's haunted atmosphere

Swore I heard a stallion neighing

Should I say or should I go? I just didn't know... Hmmmm

I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear
I never heard such profanity

I dropped my suit on the floor
they were trying to block the door
They were calling her a whore
They were driven to nativities insanity
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze

She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality

She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me
It's warmer here by the fire""

She'd have to learn to love all four of me

Pass the gun around
And throw me in the local river, let me float away

I wake up watching cartoons...the television's on
There's a couple of party balloons and all my money's gone
She was just a reason to unwind
And actually the last thing I could find

Why don't you, pass the gun around
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you better

Someone's pounding on the hotel door, he wishes he was dead

And all the hungry outlaws have taken up a stance
Simple disobedience
Yeah, all the hungry outlaws have taken up a stance

Are scrambled up and that is something you just don't understand

Just to hear it ring

In the window of your favorite corner bar

The city seems so old and grey and beat
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate
And you just live across the street

Seeing the location is within the mirrored room
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find

Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme
The memory I know I must have had when I came in
Was of some place I'd never ever been
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name

You turn into monsters at night
My toys were my friends
Until you taught them all how to bite
 
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see
You scared me with visions of fire
You danced on my bed
With the flames on your head dancing higher
 
I am the one who growls in your closet
I am the one who lives under your bed

I don't want your reptile embrace

Seeing the location is within the mirrored room 
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find 
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind 
I sat down on the stairway seven hours at a time 
Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme 
The memory I knew I must have had when I came in 
Was of some varied places where I've never ever been 
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name 
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name

Living wasn't easy in between
Behind his silent scream, Jackson in his teens
Was planning his escape

He was a crazy little child, New Orleans Alley playground
Grimy faced, he watched the hookers cry
Winos were his friends and when he talked to them
They said, Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by

Depression settin' in, desperate, cool and quick
Jackson learned the ropes out on the street
Little candy stores, just pickin' locks and doors
Was practice for a two bit petty thief

So Jackson went to Ritz and everyone was hip
Ritz ran all the rackets there in town
If you need another boy, a trigger or a blade
Well, I'm the slickest cat around

Ritz gave him the eye, once over then he smiled
Yeah, I've got something here in mind
If you meet me here at two, I think you'll like the view
Of that long green when you crack that safe tonight

Well, I'll wait for you outside and I'll be your ears and your eyes
And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot
But Ritz was taken by surprise, couple of unsuspectin' guys
And they left poor Jackson inside

Questions there were few, in fact there were none
When those sheriff's bullet start to fly
Lay dying on the floor with a smokin' forty-four

There are ribs on the fire place mixed with the wood

Killing everything that breathed, they're an inhuman race

You'll soon embrace the sight, this cold eternal light

About a redneck boy down from Tupelo

Looks like heaven's loss, gonna be my gain""

And every girl who's loves survives

Every woman has a name

You had a love affair
Some of were perfect
but most of them were pain

It took you to the highest hill
Left you standing frozen in the rain
But you still feel the afterglow
And even when your world was shakin'
Even when your breath was taken
Even when your blue eyes turned to gray

The drummer's always out of time

Billboard declared it a crime

The lyrics don't flow but I can't get it out of my mind
A three minute waste of your time
On a song that didn't rhyme 

It was bland, it was boring, all the groupies there were snoring
The first time we played it live
All the record guys got fired, the president retired
But somehow the song survived

Oh that's how I want it to be

You can always stay here with me

No more singing, no more laughing, no more sunny days

If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free.
Come on, King of the Jews.
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.
So, if you are the Christ, yes the great Jesus Christ

Punish me everyday

Who only cared for me

Here at thirty-three
I've got a heart on my right
One on my left neither suits my needs
No, the one I love lives a-way out West
And he never will need me

I'm gonna pack up my two step shoes
And head for the Gulf Coast plains
I wanna walk the streets of my own hometown
Where everybody knows my name
I wanna ride the waves down in Galveston
When the hurricane blow in
Cuz that Gulf Coast water tastes sweet as wine
When your heart's rollin' home in the wind

Alice Donut,"How I love to sleep
I was back in Mahomet, Illinois,
A Mongoloid child played with
A bright orange smurf ball

Gurgling to himself contentedly
Next to a tree. In the middle
Of the street stood a small
Repulsive chihuahua-like beast with

Huge bulging lascivious eyes and sickly
Liver spotted skin. It lifted its tail
And I saw a strange puckered
Cuntlike orafice with a tongue.

The beast started whispering to me
Beckoning to me. Mongo started jumping
Up and down screaming. The neighbors
Ran to their trailor homes and locked

Their doors. I was possessed.
I picked up the beast and
Fucked it with uncontrolled lust.
It turned its head and leered at

Me as I pumped it again and again.
It started laughing. Suddenly a sharp
Striking pain shot deep into my bowels.
I pulled out. The beast, still laughing

Deposited a milky afterbirth substance
Then ran into the woods. At the base of
My penis, the beast's sphincter was
Clamped down hard. I cut it off with a

Boyscout knife. The neighbors stared
From their windows. ""Look at me!"" I screamed
""I fuck your neighborhood pets!""
I went home and hid inside my room.

From the window I saw a police car next
To the afterbirth in the street. A fat redneck
Cop waddled out of the squad car bent over
Picked up a nugget of placenta sniffed it and

Said, ""Yep it's been fucked get out an A.P.B.
Immediately!"" I locked the doors. My belly hurt
More and more. My cock turned grey and liverspotted
Like the beast. I squeezed the head and a parasitic

Blood worm oozed out. I grabbed the worm
And pulled it out slowly. Layers of skin from
My belly to my upper thighs dissolved as I
Pulled the worm. Like an onion, layer

After layer of epidermis melted off my body with
Each tug of the worm. I woke up.
I was pissing straight up into the air through
The semi-erect tissue of a descending piss boner.

It splashed against my stomach and thighs.
God I love to sleep.",Sleep,1991

It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Alice Faye,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum.

On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine.

Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion

Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama,

You're Inferno's Dante,

Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part

Gleam in its eye, bright as rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me
Could it be, yes it could
Something's comin', something good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click, with a shock
Phone'll jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when
But it's soon
Catch the moon
One handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be, yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there
Come on, something
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is humming
And something great is coming
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight!",Something's Coming,2007
