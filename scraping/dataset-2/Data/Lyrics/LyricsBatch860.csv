Preluders,"Oh
Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that
I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded
Fool fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come fading around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you cry

That was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

That was just a dream
(Losing my religion)
That was just a dream
(Losing my religion)

And I try, I try, I try",Losing My Religion,2003

Shiny and new

Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats (after first time, ""With your heartbeat"")

Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Do miracles happen?
Can I get paid for my passion?

Proud to say I've never caught up with fashion
These clothes can't cover your soul

Lo sapete non so stare senza di voi
Presto, sedetevi,
Al banchetto attendevamo soltanto voi
Sempre ogni giorno che verrà
Finche amore e pace regnerà.

Sempre piagnucola

Chissà perché perché ecc. ecc. ...

Sale adagio verso me.
E la vita nel mio petto batte piano,
Respira la nebbia, penso a te.
Quanto verde tutto intorno a ancor piú in là,
Sembra quasi un mare l'erba,
E leggero il mio pensiero vola e va
Ho quasi paura che si perda...
Un cavallo tende il collo verso il prato
Resta fermo come me:
Faccio un passo, lui mi vede, è già
Fuggito...
Respiro la nebbia, penso a te.
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono come, un uomo in cerca di se stesso
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono solo, solo il suono del mio passo...

Premiata Forneria Marconi,"All'ombra dell'ultimo sole 
S'era assopito un pescatore 
E aveva un solco lungo il viso
Come una specie di sorriso

Venne alla spiaggia un assassino
Due occhi grandi da bambino
Due occhi enormi di paura
Eran gli specchi di un'avventura

E chiese al vecchio ""dammi il pane
Ho poco tempo e troppa fame""
E chiese al vecchio ""dammi il vino
Ho sete e sono un assassino""

Gli occhi dischiuse il vecchio al giorno
Non si guardò neppure intorno
Ma versò il vino e spezzò il pane 
Per chi diceva ""ho sete, ho fame""

E fu il calore d'un momento
Poi via di nouvo verso il vento
Davanti agli occhi ancora il sole
Dietro alle spalle un pescatore

Dietro le spalle un pescatore
E la memoria è già dolore
È già il rimpianto d'un aprile

Vennero in sella con le armi

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Just to get up that hill

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player

Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what

She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong

I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how

You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me

satan doesn't exist under the soil and trees

and made you believe
in a religion based on money and greed

so follow my lead
and get on your knees

Shut your mouth

you'll get your tongue ripped out
this is my house
you want to be talkin' trash
then keep on walkin' fast
you ain't gonna last
tryin' to pimp like Shaft
you make me laugh
and you smell real bad
I could set you up with a nice warm bath
it's Slim keepin' it thin
don't make come over there and kick your ass
and all that jazz
and all these rhymes
that go buck
like ten dimes
just tryin' to open your eyes wide
so you don't go blind

Gradually
I begin to see
everything that stands in front of me
cowards facing their insecurities
by attacking me
when I'm down on my knees
stealing my air
when it's hard to breathe
manipulating people
to make them believe
I pity you bitch
you ain't shit to me
I run the show now
so set your ego free

For teaching me the things
I couldn't have learned without you
And I know that you're watching over me
So tell me
Did I turn out to be everything that you hoped I'd be
I just wish I had a second chance to say
That I love you
'cause I didn't
Before you passed away
I hope you know how many lives you touched
Your memory lives in all of us
I miss you so much

One final breath
Between you and I one final test
When I looked into your eyes
This is what you left
All I am inside
With one final breath
You gave me life

Just the other night
You visited me in a dream
You looked as healthy as ever
The best I've ever seen
You stood there in the light
Surrounded by a sea of green
It was a beautiful place
Where only love could breathe
Then you took me by the hand
And told me silently that objects in the mirror may be closer than they seem
And I thanked you with a smile
For reminding me
You didn't have to speak
'cause I heard every word
Your message was clear and you can be rest assured
That I'll teach all the rest the best of all that I've learned
Your death gave life to me
And I've turned into the best person that I can be
Court's adjourned


Now I live my life for you

To the greatest teacher I've ever known
From beyond you showed me that I'll never be alone 
And I've grown beyond my years
These tears are here to show you that I've conquered the fear
Let us not grieve over your death
But celebrate your life
And let you rest
A life with no regrets/just love and happiness
You taught us this and now bliss manifests",One Final Breath,2001

One more drink at the club
One more dap
Better yet one more hug
One more nug to smoke
Wash it down with a Captain & Coke
One more freestyle flow ?cause you were just startin' to get dope

But we got each other so we're gonna be just fine

Coming like a reaper marching in the second life

And although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers 
Do cry away their gloom.

I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!

Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""

I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck

Esta noche que más puedo esperar
Si con la música yo te vuelvo a recordar

En nuestra casa no han dejado de faltar
Aquellas cosas que solías ordenar
Fotografías que prendí con alfiler
Vagos recuerdos que aun gusta retener, así

Y esta noche que más puedo pedir
Si aunque los días pasan tú sigues estando en mi
Esta noche que más puedo esperar
Si con la música yo te vuelvo a recordar

Yo se que pronto escapare de la prisión de tus ojos
Pero esta noche elegiré, permanecer

Ya lo sé, yo sigo anclada en el ayer
Ya lo sé, que me equivoco
Y esta nostalgia nunca podré vencer

Esta noche que más puedo pedir
Si aunque los días pasan yo sigo pensando en ti
Esta noche que más puedo esperar
Si con la música yo te vuelvo a recordar

But I noticed his scent started to change somehow 
His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his brow 
I said ""baby, oh sweetheart""

Blackmailed emotions confuse the demon and devotee 
I was sure his intentions were sweet

We were two birds of paradise

When I was a little girl 
With clay horses and lambs on the shelf 
I caught frogs in ditches, listened for elves 
My friends and I had a world unto ourselves 
No grownups could find us when we 
Made our plans so secretly 
To run away and fly to be 
With the two birds of paradise

Now once upon a time my mind still there wanders 
Back in the room the things I remember 
One time when we took off our clothes 
But you were cryin', cryin' 
You said nothing lasts forever 
We were happy together 
I thought about you in Stockholm and Rome 
Me in my hotel room 
You in your home 
This is the life they say that 
Dreams are made of 
Don't forget 
Please do forgive me 
I still have something you did give me 
Come into my dream with me and dream

Please don't forget 
Do forgive me 
I still have something you did give me 
Come into my dream with me and dream 
Oh dream of paradise",Birds of Paradise,1981

Bewildered and deluded, have I been hit by a truck?

Felt like the time in the womb

Under the bed with my teeth sunk into my own flesh

But I noticed his scent started to change somehow
His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his brow

Blackmailed emotions confuse the demon and devotee

He liked her
Better than me
Couldn't even get in the dance
In fact I didn't stand a chance
Clearly
It was her not me

That's the way I'm going down
Growing a town
That was my worst round
A classed, comfort pound

I can't compete on the streets
I haven't got the heat
Can't keep up with the beat,
Like I should
This neighborhood
I thought I had nothing to prove
Than the bouncer made me move
And that little piece of fluff
Moved in on and ran with the groove

That's the way I'm going down
Watch me now
As I hit the ground
Take a look around
You see me?

That's the way I'm going down
Put a padlock on my door
They're closing me down
Hide in the best hotel in town

Broke the lines
Crossed the border to another time
Being drawn by the fates
Who run our destinies
Stranded in a state of life

Felt every aim was true
You were the target right from the start
Since you came walking out of the blue

Into the morning light

Looking up in fear
Now who were the fools

Gonna hold your fire high
Stand up for your reasons
Dead or alive
Its a game of do or die
In your fight for freedom

Oppress you with muscle and might
They fear the rebellion in sight
With evil tyrannic regimes
They rule but they can't kill your
Dreams

Scream it out loud
They're deaf to the crowd
Ignore your demands to be free
Free and break your bonds
Never bow to no one
Cry for justice within you long for it
Want it

[Chorus]

All for the cause is wrath the price
Another human sacrifice
Another spill of blood on the bricks
Beyond their minds as cold as ice
Beyond their little white washed lies
Love don't exist

Pretty Maids,"In the summer we'd be crazy
We'd fool around all the time
Oh how I loved that girl
When she was mine
But now she'd left me
For another guy
And it really brought me down
For without that girl
I was lost and found

Oh darling please don't hurt me this way
Oh darling please don't leave me
Oh darling please don't hurt me this way
Oh darling please don't leave me

Now I get messed up
And I fool around

I feel intoxicated
Desolated

Images of evil
Scenes of suffering

I'm falling into pieces
I'll close my eyes

Before I bleed to death

It all becomes my world of fiction

Help now before
It gets too late
I'm burning down the candle
Can't you hold on back
The hands of fate

Through my wretched visions
Mental exhibition
Blind confusion
Disillusions

But there's only one way
There's only one way to rock

So many things can get you high
I'm gonna try them all just once before I die
And you can analyzed the situation
To me it's all just mental masturbation

Now quickly check the hands
On the clock it's 8.05 it's time to rock

No one will ever walk the streets again
Has told the cops about that dreadful night

Are you hurt some voices mutter
As your blood runs down the gutter
Someone saw a face through the night
But as a rescue city light
Darkness melt before my eyes
As the last bit of witchcraft dies
Killed this nightmare to giant sighs
But as a rescue city light

As the morning reaches a point of greed
Voices of horror reject my plea
A grand explosion of human fright
But as a rescue morning light

A search for thrills that you cannot find
How much more can you stand these nights
But as a rescue morning light

I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your, all your life shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect strangers

I know 
I know, I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Oh, is aching with the dead of the night
Oh oh precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain

Schlechte Christen halten auch den Weihnachtsmann für 'n Extremisten
Müsst ihr auf Minderheiten immer gleich mi'm Finger zeigen?
Gegenfrage, wieso müsst ihr eure Frauen wie Ninjas kleiden?
Und wieso macht ihr tagsüber strictly auf Koranschüler?

I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the

And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?

It's all good baby baby

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay

I know a nigga can't live without you. 
Ain't no need to cry about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
I even wrote a song about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you.

I was staying wit my momma. 
I stayed getting in trouble, man. 
Straight damn drama. 
I started dancing so I stayed out of trouble. 
'cause I stayed in school, selling candy so my money doubled. 
But then you told me man, dancing was for punks. 
Then you told me come and stay. 
And you ain't care what I want. 
You told me come and dance and rap wit my brothers. 
You taught me how to love and how to care for my brothers. 
And then you taught me all yo hustlin' skills. 
Just in case I get alone I know how to pay bills. 
You told me I was straight regardless of a deal. 
And I love you man for that 'cause you always kept it real. 

Maybe we could work it out. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
And every time I think about it. 
I know a nigga can't live without you. 
Ain't no need to cry about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
I even wrote a song about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 

Now that I made it, it feel real good. 
Take you out the hood. 
Put you on be	 and the block in the middle of the woods. 
And as hard as it seems, you was there for me. 
One bedroom apartment. 
On 6-0 14 number efficiency down in Coverly. 
Told you I had a dream.
And even though I like to cheat. 
I'm going along my Georgia peach and that's a promise I'm gone keep. 
To the end, never gone blend. 
And I can hear you tell yo friends. 
And I can see you want to buss and fuss with yo brand new Benz. 
To the world, baby it's yours. 
I'd give you the world 'cause you not no ordinary girl. 
I'm yo son, you my ol' girl. 
My momma, we shared for 19 years. 
And from the bottom of my foundation I'm telling you how I feel,
and I love ya. 

Maybe we could work it out. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
And every time I think about it. 
I know a nigga can't live without you. 
Ain't no need to cry about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
I even wrote a song about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 

See, I fell in love wit ya. 
want to raise my kids wit ya. 
But you left me all alone wit tears dripping down the picture. 
I remember the day like yesterday. 
May 9th, to be exact. 
I'd do anything to get you back. 
Even though I know you ain't coming back. 
I'm serious as a heart attack. 
Could we get it back the way it was? 
'cause I know you had some outside influences that pulled a plug. 
The reality, Junebug, girl I know we'll always be together. 
I got you locked away deep in my heart, always here forever. 

Maybe we could work it out. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
And every time I think about it. 
I know a nigga can't live without you. 
Ain't no need to cry about it. 
'cause you know I can't live without you. 
I even wrote a song about it.

You called my phone and told me
""Baby come through""
I said unlock the door
And I'll be there in a few
Brought ""Love and Basketball""
and ordered some food
Now it's time to do 
All the things that you want to do boo
Open the door, look it back 
And head into the room
Pop in a movie, hit the lights 
And lay next to you
Cuddle under the covers

It feel like heaven when I'm with ya
Baby I just want to chill with ya
Spend some time with ya
Wine and dine with ya
In my mind I'm painting a beautiful picture
Me and you spending Q.T.
On the low key, baby we overseas
Knocking boots like H-town
You holding me girl
You got me feenin' like Jodeci

If they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stuntin' through the city tryin' to find a lady who
Beautiful, but she gotta have booty too

You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of the salami
Knock knock knock knock you down like a tsunami
Bust in you like atomize

Hotter than a bisquick biscuit out the oven
Your baby mama go on missions to get this lovin'
We kissin' and huggin' she never pick her phone up
You be lookin' for her while we doin' the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms,
But she love when she get the back to back orgasms
Yes sir, the game is automatic, give it to 'em one time
They come back like addicts.

Lookin' good Spec and Baby Blue and Pleasure Fool
That's all we got!
Let me drop my top pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda bag of chips
That's all I got
Park outside minglin' wit' my homeboys
Faked out fake hugs leave me alone boy
Plus the candy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' cross the street
But on the other hand
Alfalfa Just hit me on my metro
Say a party in the park hard baby let's go
The balla tick no questions asked, so I jumped out the white jag
Smooth like Shaq come her girl!

Guaranteed that satisfaction
Got them whip lashes on your back
Any day Any time if I'm running through your mind
You want this mankind then see me on the time

Front back side to side
You can feel it on your spine
If I'm lying I'm flying for real
But I ain't lying
I'm the late night crasher
The late night trasher
And the late night caster
The late night casper
And the late night master (I'm the late night special)

[Chorus]

I'ma be about it I ain't a talker
Don't stop get it get it like Skywalker
Popping that nookie I'll be your groupie
Your late night stalker
Step up in it hit slow like a moon walker
Be your special delivery at your door
Leave your body shaking and shivering on the floor
Can you handle how I deal with this sexual healing
Your body like math divided in half.
You ain't gotta close this door
Just take them clothes off
Girl I'm bout to break you off
I'm feeling on your body and your skin's soft
If you wanna say no then that's your loss
I never go soft never go raw
Turn the telephone off
Let me get in the fall
Swinging that thing tearing down your walls
Your can hear us through the walls
Oh yeah you can feel us through the walls

He can't stroke it like this
He can't stroke it like that
He can't stroke it like this
He can't stroke it like that
Soon as you walk through the door I want them panties to the floor
I'll have you calling for more
I'm the late night special

He can't stroke it like this
He can't stroke it like that
He can't stroke it like this
He can't stroke it like that
Soon as you walk through the door

Leave it all up to you girl

Yeah girl I'm gonna leave it up to you
I wanna see what your gonna do
'cause tonight it's only me and you
Yeah yeah whoa
Let me do you after school like some homework
But please don't give me no STD's
I'm gonna leave it up to you to please me
Age ain't nothing but a number
You don't need id for me
I'll be your lover undercover
And you ain't gotta tell your mother we're in love with each other
Because our first chance to romance
We can sneak away and take trip to France with your friends
But tonight I'm all yours
Leave it up to you to devour this full course
With dessert of course
So what you waiting for
You're stuttering saying gimme gimme more gimme gimme gimme more

[Chorus]

Let's take our time slow it down
I'm gonna show you how a real player get down
I'm a blue star baby ain't no pressure
Come over here let me lift your dress up
On the dresser what's your pleasure
Call up the maid and she can clean the mess up
Don't say nothing baby hold that thought

Every thing I do is messed up
You got me torn up
Like Latoya Luckett
Wanna drop it in your bucket
I'm a player tryna crush it
I can tell that you want it
Oh honey you got my feelings involved
I wanna cuff it
Been 2 weeks 4 days 1 hour
And I still ain't touch it
I wanna put it in your stomach like some Robitussin
Your body language telling me you want the same thing
You not no ordinary girl 'cause you're my main thing
This ain't no guessing game
I'm not tryna play hang man
Show you things, buy you things
Oh you're a sexy thing
Ice in your earring
Ice on your pinky ring
Ice on your tongue ring
That's ice on my ding-a-ling

Pretty Ricky,"That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

See I came at it, and I came at it, now I'm so addicted like a gambling habit
'cause you was the one here, when I ain't have it
Now you say you leaving me but I ain't having it
We put too much in just to pull out
This thing's just too good for me to pull out
Girl you know pleasure can't stand to see you crying
So I'm gonna love you or die trying

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

I reminiscence on the way that it was
(first kiss, first hug)
24-7 you was on my mind
(baby girl you was my first love)
We closer than the pages in my composition book
(but I let you walk in front so them other players could look)
And when they tried to holla, you point at me and say that you took
(and you've been in my heart before I know that you can cook)
Girl you shine like brand new dime,
The love I have for you is more than all my chicks combined

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

See pleasure is pain, and pain is love
First kiss, first touch, first hug
God had send you up from above,
2 jitterbugs on the back of the bus kissing like we grown up's...
But we broke up, all the pain we went through is on us..
A couple months went by, then we woke up
Break up to make up, girl you know us...
And you then try, but they'll never be able to do the things that you do
They ain't got your style, your body and smile,
They ain't really off the chain like you
Because I showed you how to ride it, and you showed me how you like it
When it is time for that good loving, you read my mind like a psychic
So whenever I'm gone, you worry 'bout your king to return to the throne,
That's why our love is strong,
And you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout me doing wrong,
Just long as you come back home
'cause this where you suppose to be,
Right here close to me,
On the side of me, baby girl you can ride with me,
'cause with you, that's where I'm tryna be you know
I love you girl!

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love

I can't explain it for you girl,
Because I've been around the world and I met a lot of other girls.
But they're nothing like you
No no no

You know I love you, frozen cup your wrist, so I can spoil you, hold you..
Never ignore you, adore you, when times get hard, I'll do anything for you...
Remember back in the days, parkway, catch an early matinee at the emine'
Rubbing oil of olay on yo body, hot tamalae,
but 'cause you're my shorty life passes by when you're busy
Making plans I'm a bigger man, a veteran, a business man, a gentleman,
I know you're so sick and tired of my ignorance,
I can't breathe, I can't get no sleep, without you my life is incomplete,
Picnic's at a party, and corn on the cob, real talk,
from the start, you got the keys too
My heart, that's a promise to god.

That's how people fall in love (in love)
First kiss, first hug
Can we make it like it was? We were, in love
Can we make it like it was? See the love I have, that I have for you

So relax lay back and get comfortable, 
Even though you're my ex-girl to me you still my next girl
Infatuated with things you do you sweet plus you're my best girl, 
I'm on my knees begging you please
Baby stay don't go away but it's getting late and I can see the expressions on your face,
I'm ready to settle down and share a couple of kids with you
Travel overseas with you fulfill my every dreams with you

My niggas handcuff bringing broads in to town cause
We in the trenches where its fucking going down.

......without probable cause watch the G's react.
Move fool like they don't exist
Put lick on his chevy and hi frozen wrist
And grind most sported dickie for another day
Linking up with niggas that get it the same fucking way
.......go getta fuck the club, lets get paid
We enter a small town, distributing all around,
Plenty time for pussy, right now put down cause

Business before pleasure, speaking of pleasure
My R&B road dawg, we hwaded up to Tennessee then to Mississippi 
Where its got the vicious clicks more conscerned with paper.
Not here for the clubbin' shit.
But niggas think I'm trippin'
Like sumthin' must be wrong wit him.
Really rather rob rappers, fuck doing song wit'em.

Ho chiesto qua va bene tu mi hai detto “Boh oh oh”
Ti porto un bicchiere e hai detto “Ma da solo no”
Facciamo una sveltina fly dentro una Renault
Il nostro baretto ha chiuso ciao ciao ora c’è
Un caffè gourmet dove un piatto costa “Eh”
Stavo meglio in quello vecchio mi sentivo un re
Ora pijo un Peroni prima ne pigliavo tre
Lei cucina bene vuole andare a Masterchef
Un filino troppo sale, butta via nel trash
Perso il cell alla stazione ne ritrovo tre
E tu hai cominciato col solito putiferio
Dai ti prego accanna amo’ con il piatto greco
Non ti reggo proprio poi lo sai che non mi regolo
Insulti grevi tutti i santi scesi giù dal cielo
Sul soffitto un geco, lo guardo di sbieco

E 10, te l’ho già detto che mi scoccia non vederti
Che un messaggio tuo ormai debba finire con un “Baci”
Abbiamo battuto tutti i record
E rifatto circa centomila volte almeno la tessera Arci
Eppure oggi mai ‘na gioia solo sòle, solo calci, solo storie
Io non voglio entrarci
Ciao, ti chiamo un taxi

Sotto al cielo ho perso tempo rigirandomi nel letto
Ho visto il sole tra le nuvole e mi batte forte il petto
Un lampione spento, gocce di vino sopra al pavimento
Camminiamo con l’ombrello sotto al temporale
Con l’inverno che ci abbraccia il suo sorriso in faccia
Il mare mosso, la calma piatta
Il suo rossetto sulle labbra
Le chiedo solo un motivo, un fiore in mezzo al giardino
Oggi facciamoci un giro dai ti prego pago io yeh yeh
Mi guarda da lontano, mandami un bacio
Perdonami per tutto quanto

When they do dumb shit
Suckers that want to step to it
Better come equip
Zip your lip pop shit and get rip
You beef you miss me
Across one-tenth street
Stay on point
Pack a joint and
Don't sleep
You snooze you lose
You get sprayed with the Uz
Just like mountain you're paying me dues
Murdering crews
By the twos and the fews

Stuck up spots on a hundred forty-fifth
Kicking the gift to a bitch on a stroll

So you lose control
Bust out shots
Cop drops
Hit cement

Shoot a nigga for a buck-fitty
On the block they say I did it for fun, well
Niggas got done on the one by a gun shell
Bounce in a Benz or a jet-black dope BM
Light up the choke buddah blunt with the opium
Shift the gear to fifth and we're murking
Heavy on the jewelry bum bitches smirking
D.T.'s are lurking
G's I be jerking
Crack head said that my jumbos are working
Two for five blacktops
Give me props
Padlocks on glocks
Sewed up like Fort Knox
Columbian rocks on weight like a bull bell
Drug kingpin like Medellin Cartel
Check my mail got keys on delivery
Take the fleet my tongue numb and shivery
At the casino with Pretty T. Pacino
New Jack City Nitty should of played Nino

On the streets I walk
I'm the king of New York
Up north I rip soft niggas with a fork
Use a knife or spoon in the temple of doom
Stroke down low down showdown's at noon
Pack your bags
Get smacked with the Mag
The mob is deep in the Saab and the Jags
Ragtop brother cop you can't stop this
Sissy soft faggot-nigga I'm a knock west
Don't you doubt this, yo I'm blasting
Putting punk ligaments in a casting
Traction coma

You can't school me
I pack toolies

I swing with kingpins but I'm legit

Pretty Tone Capone,"I was the third brother of five
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not saying what I did was alright
Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight

Been down so long, getting up didn't cross my mind
I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find
You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 110th Street
Woman trying to catch a trick on the street
Across 110th Street
You can find it all in the street

I got one more thing I'd like to y'all about right now

Hey brother, there's a better way out
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong, if you want to survive

The family on the other side of town
Would catch hell without a ghetto around
In every city you find the same thing going down
Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town

Across 110th Street
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
Across 110th Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free

I dogged two pairs of sneaks in the first week
I couldn't sleep, 'cause I was afraid to miss a beat
Now my phase done passed and I'm in the game deep
The smokers love me, watch for the cops and my peeps

My mom kinda new, and so did the law too
Respect was due, so I chill when they come through
I calm down my crew, put a skirt on the brew
I always miss my curfew but what the fuck would you do?

With 5000 a night, off each G I made a tre'
The block was warm as May and gettin hotter every day
With no dues to pay, wasn't a way I could lose
But my last week of school my ol' head was on the news

[Chorus: x 2]
In order to eat, you gon' struggle
I ain't gon' lie
While you eat you gon' struggle
Don't ask me why
Life is all a struggle then you die, yeah
Is it fair? Nah - Does life care? Nah

Now I'm back where I started, couple grand and a stash
Wrote my man down what happened, told him watch his ass
After this court case pass, we gon' try it again
Until then I made friends with a pad and a pen

I wrote about current affairs and issues I was havin
All the coke I was baggin and all the pussy I was taggin
Every rhyme gave me the chills, 'cause everything I wrote was real
Now who the fuck thought I'd get me a deal?

I grew up in Philadel, 2-3 to 4-6
It's survival of the fit, I'd flip a brick and get rich
But rough times danced along, but money was the song
But I couldn't get it on, 'cause my ol' head was gone

I went to visit him, he said paper stay strong
Watch my new born, I'ma be here real long
But I gotta get mine, he said, ""Naw get signed""
Didn't know I was livin live, till I had a decent time

[Chorus: x 2]

Now two years done passed, I came home with to cash
Tried to catch up with the past but the streets is movin fast
I had homies, but they left me lonely
Either they fell for a case, or they fell for a tenderonie

I was stuck in between a dream and a drug scene
Wasn't born with mean but I learned how to D
I lace a lot, five times a day non-stop
But I miss huggin the block and spendin a knot

Money was callin, felt myself Riq' I was fallin
I started robbin, 'cause I couldn't stand starvin
And then I got shot two times in two spots
I almost went in shock because the blood wouldn't stop

I ain't gon' lie, I ain't ready to die
I ain't ready to fry, but I'm ready to ride
Some flip bricks and get rich, some stay broke and flip burgers
I'm gon' get further, write murder or get murdered

[Chorus: x 2]

Now after dark, the shit starts, I plays my part
I see the NARCs stash my coat then hit the park
Don't wanna get knocked, for sixty rocks in a sock
You know the ghetto's red hot, gots to shot that on my block

I keep it strictly business, it's unfinished if there's a witness
I take it personal when bitch-ass niggaz start to snitchin'
That shit gets me flamin', what these niggaz think they gamin'?
Nothin' but this four 24 aimin'

God's woman, what's going on?
I know things seem messed up sometime
You stressed out and you can't handle the situation
Sometime it feels like you lacking the guidance
And you don't know what to do, but stay strong
And keep in mind that he always loves you,
It's what it is, that's right sugar love
Come on

You'll be here, to do them all over again

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like Tabasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infatuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's goin' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching

[Chorus]

[Trife Da God]
She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Josephine, what's wrong, baby?
Come on

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?
Her little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world
Trying to make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

[Willie Cottrell]
Up all night, under the party lights
Same old popping and party hopping
All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road
Leading you back to crack, it's a known fact

Pretty Willie,"[Chorus]
It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d
When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo
I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on
I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Deep in the scene, like the music getting fascinating
Touching the screen, like the view from my imagination
Ninety degrees, got me circulating
I've been waiting, Impatiently
Got me changing stations on occasion

What's your frequency?
Can you connect with me?
If it's alright your satellite can be my energy

Don't want to be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

[Chorus]

Survive the people's faces, they're dancing from temptation
Her icky style is wasted, you don't need no invitation
Hey there cutey boys
Making all the noise
It's getting hard up in here
You don't have a choice

What's your frequency?
Can you connect with me?
If it's alright your satellite can be my energy

Don't want to be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Full-bearded, Serpico wit flows yo 
Coolin in the cut crevice, underground tavern 
Wit wifey and seed, still on point like a javelin

Madchild twists and turns like an indian burn 
With powerful jaws and character flaws
Rippin and tearin wit claws 
Kill if I'm aware of the cause 
Not to mention, knuckles white from inner tension 
Witch doctors and war chiefs approaching 
Fantastic adventures, a frightening fortune 
Scorpion tail snaps, constrictor strangles 
S+M rocks, Dilated works the angles

Yo I'm inspired and wired 
That time will be attractive 
Not tired I've fired volcanoes still are active
Causin drama or terror, it's fabulous 
I'll bounce to the arctic with a backpack full of travelers Checks to burn, stay warm for the brain storm

I freeze if I don't sleep below the ice for my blanket 
Thank earth for it's hidden treasures
And now I'm takin drastic measures

Indulge in this intrusion 
Underworld defender 
Horrendous snowball of absolute insaneness (feel me) 
Riskin freedom to be famous 
When nothin remains except passion and pain 
No slashin the vein, to bleed and drown in a bath 
Fall down and I laugh, get up wipe myself off

Insync, blazing wit killer instinct

My comparative dissention
From high as an intense discription
Of why the valkyrie fly, calculate
The circumference of the sky for future reference
Measure it all from bird's eye to add some fuel to my furnace
To those who scratch the surface and lace signs of plotonus
Expected to strown trajectory of David's sling to Goliath
Nor abundance of nouses accommodate my body weight
Circle 1-9-7-5 with
Instruments of vine and I'll
Dine the road of chrisis if it
Crosses over to the land of radiogiants 
Founded by po-pyus and pontious pilots
I make ?garbious? my habit to stab it until it's had it
Encourage the cutting of Marionette by bayonette
To escape the twin maker's cabinet
I was born in between 11:59 and 12 which 12 falls into thirteen
Prepare the barricades for the running of the ramping
While some try to change or exist to its wash cloth soaked in chlorine

[Madchild]
Much too dangerous
Meet the perfect stranger
I'm the extreme case of fire and anger
The misguided angel with deep routed fears
My face shows the years of blood sweating tears
Pay attention, this gypsy that deeply senses
Evil spirits lurking behind picket fences
Embarking darker images and skeletal remains
Cold hearted soldier with ice in his veins
I'm twice as insane
My advice is refrain
From confrontation, total annihilation
Serenating my princess, gut renching terror
See much clearer on my side of the mirror.....
Progressing modestly, moderately dichotomy
Manslaughter sporadically, automatically adequate
Gang up on myself, by myself, but keep me out of it
Undoubtedly a lunatic, Battle Axe exclusive
I'm utterly repulsive and self abusive
Offerings from the gifted I'm swiftly elusive
Making fun of myself I'm quadrofrenic mentally
Not laughing at me I'm laughing with me accidentally

And harlots madchild prevails tails of the unwanted 
Not to be taken for granted 
My past has come back and haunted for real

You gotta to be real an you gots to have heart 

Stir the blur, nuts and bolts whirl 
Stored in electric ports, 4 strong boxes of 10 floors 
Shift the weight towards the door, in hopes of escape

Soft rhymers, metamorphize their cartoon characters 
Grafted from Africa, in this game you got no stature 
Not even a factor in this 
Whole shit makes me yawn 
Snatch your heart out your chest like a '96 ghetto spawn
Antonym of urban, too feminine for this cut-throat mentality 
Have ? thoughts in my area, you get snatched out your Suburban 
Fallacy with no antidote, in this ? your age get broke 
Runnin' from gun smoke, ballin' never rumin'

Drake rhyme about these bitches, I just fuck 'em all

Banana clips, fully automatic, you can't duck 'em all

You start to feel like Hardaway with that UTEP, two step
They come in the league like A.I
With that their look and that crossover
Moving that make their old shit seem useless
But I'm balling

And when she piss you off, do me a favor
Hop in that bitch and peel it back

But I don't give a fuck about nothin' but good vagina
Long as these niggas call me GOAT
If I don't get through to you the call failed
Cause I was probably on that Wolf of Wall Street boat, I'm a hard sell
Maybe too lyrical for 'em

I chose the latter like a fireman climbin' up to a charred rail

Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
You voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now

Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate reaching out to both of us
There's a story in my eyes, turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire

I can't hold back, I'm on the edge

You voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down

Pride of Lions,"She was the sunlight, I was the storm
We lit up the sky above
She set me on fire, like no woman born
Blinded me with her love

We were inseparable, joined at the heart
Taking on the world, racing with the dark

Then suddenly
She vanished in the night
Without a trace

She's gone (she left with the song)
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She was my angel
And she's gone

Sometimes the rain clouds cover the sun
And block out the light of day
All of the music, all of the joy
Is missing along the way

Where does the feeling go when it is gone
What changed to make the difference, how could it all
Go wrong

When suddenly
She vanished in the night
Without a trace

She's gone (she left with the song)
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She was my angel
And she's gone

Is she wearing that sundress that goes with her eyes
Is she starting to undress to rest for the night
I still love her, I still need her
I'll be watching and waiting the rest of my life

She's gone
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She's gone
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She was my angel
And she's gone

Pride of Lions,"The lights come up, the show is over
The theater empties as the credits roll by
This house is cold, the song is fading
I sit alone as curtains close on this heart of mine

And I wonder how it all came down
To the famous final scene
How we lost the thread that held us
Spellbound in a dream

Now the stage is dark
And the theaters cold and lonely
The music fades
Like an interrupted melody
We wrote the score
Now I hear the words ""if only""
Hangin' in the air
Like an interrupted melody

The word began, my life found meaning
The very moment when I saw your face
All traffic stopped, I held you breathless
I melted into you and lost all sense of time and space

Now I could've sworn forever's touch

Had surely leny a glove
In conducting our life's symphony
The melody of love

Now the stage is dark
And the theaters cold and lonely
The music fades
Like an interrupted melody
We wrote the score
Now I hear the words ""if only""
Hangin' in the air
Like an interrupted melody

I, I've been searching for the reason
Tell me, why, are we strangers to the song
Oh, could we go back to the season
When we walked this earth together
Two against the storm

Pride of Lions,"You let it slip right through your fingers
You let the moment disappear without a trace
Now the photograph is faded
And the smile you wore seems sadly out of place

Some nights
When you feel that you're the only one who bleeds
Reach out
When you doubt the love you really need

It's criminal
To possess the key to life yet be so cynical
To deny the possibility, it's criminal
To let the chances of a lifetime
Pass you by

Every picture tells a story
I hear the sound of desperation in your voice
It's a broken road to glory
And we lose if we refuse to make a choice

Someday
When you least expect it love will come to you
Reach out
When you let the pressure get to you

It's criminal
To possess the key to life yet be so cynical
To deny the possibility, it's criminal

To let the chances of a lifetime
Pass you by

Spread your wings for all the world to see
Illuminate your darkened corners
Celebrate each brand new morning

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agree, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and giving up too much ass
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, Caught me a home run
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth

I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do no and you know I'm
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoes
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agree, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and giving up too much ass
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, Caught me a home run
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof
Then she said somethin bout the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where 
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird
So I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me
   
You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash

I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Want to grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they want to do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang
That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby

I said bitch, what are you smoking
A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstanding
Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the east-side
How much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though
Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money

In the night

Prilly Hamilton,"Everybody, everybody 
I want you to listen to me for a little bit right here 
I wanted you to read the newspapers this morning 

Or did you see the evening news 
As you were having dinner with your families last night? 
Well, if you did then you must know that 
This world is now in a whole lot of trouble 

But I don't want you to get discouraged by that, no 
Because I believe that there's a solution to all of this 
Deep down within my soul 
All we have to do is put are heads and hearts together 

You gotta wake up everybody and no more sleeping in bed 
And no more backward thinking, it's time for thinking, ahead 
The world's changed so very much from what it used to be 
There's so much hatred, war and poverty, oh yeah 

Wake up all you teachers, you better teach a new way 
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say 

Because they are the ones 
Who's coming up and the world is in their hands 
When you teach the children 
You better teach them the very best you can 

The world won't get no better 
If you just let it be, no no 
The world won't get no better 
You gotta change again, you and me 

Wake up all you doctors, make the old people well 
Because they're the ones who suffer a lot and catch all the hell 
They don't hassle very long before their judgment day 
Won't you make them happy before they pass away? 

Wake up all you builders, it's time to build a new land 
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand 
Only thing we have to do is put it in our minds 
And surely things will work out, they do it every time 

The world won't get no better, oh no 
If we just let it be

Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

I've been patient, I've been good, try'n to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back, you know what I mean
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view, we know each other mentally
You've gotta know that you're bringin' out the animal in me

Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk

Oh let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let's get animal, animal, I wanna get animal, let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk, let me hear your body talk
Let me hear your body talk, let me hear your body talk",Physical,2000
Primal Fear,"Blood is running down the street
The war's still going on
The soldiers are marching to the beat
They never will come home

Fear and terror mutilate
Your personality
So be prepared to die
Find your tranquility

Emotionless they fight and kill
Destroying is their only will

Battalions of hate, glorified crime
Battalions of hate

Aggression, anger, hatred, pain
We're sick of all your lies
War is just a senseless game
And we must pay the price

War is like a prison cell
It's a room without a door
It is like living in hell
No one really knows

Look into the eyes of death
Battalions have taken your last breath",Battalions of Hate,1998
Primal Fear,"Out of this world in another dimension
2000 light years from home
Defending the faith he fights for a mission
But he is standing alone

Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight

Chain breaker
He fights for the right
Chain breaker

Watchin' the dark he suppresses the evil
Raisin' the spirit up high
Beware of the dead this place is so lethal
He's livin' a dangerous lie

Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight

Chain breaker
He fights for the right
Chain breaker

Devastating disillusion no solution
Everlasting resurrection with dejection
Degradation desperation lost emotion
Aggravation desolation in perfection

Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight

Chain breaker
He fights for the right",Chainbreaker,1998
Primal Fear,"I saw a Cadillac driving to the wishing well
A sweet illusion or a secret from hell

I was paralyzed, kinda hypnotized
And the time stood still

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth

There's no one scared and nothing left
Was it my lucky day or am I a jerk

Your shadow's still here, do you live in fear
Is this superstition

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth

Your shadow's still here, do you live in fear
Is this superstition

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth
See the truth
See the truth",Dollars,1998
Primal Fear,"Acceleration, my body's pressed into the seat
Fascination, pipes are glowing in the heat
Am I the fastest one can I improve
Making a late run I still got the groove
Pole Position, I'm on the top prepared to win
Rising tension, the lights are set, the start begins

Smoking Wheels, I'm getting faster, take the lead
Shifting gears, the engines pushed up to top speed

Formula One, the class of kings on highest level
Formula One, come to see me win

Wheels are spinning, on slicks I have the perfect grip
Feel like winning, the fastest lap is now complete
I am the fastest one, taking this race
I'm overtaking, setting the pace

Feel the street, I take the curves, I love to slice
Beat my beat, I'll finish first and take the price

Formula One, the class of kings on highest level
Formula One, come to see me win
Formula One, will get into your blood forever
Formula One, let the show begin

Elated at victory, I stand on the podium
The audience is roaring, they reach out for me
Showers of champagne are running down my neck
In honor of my country they play the nation's song

Acceleration, my body's pressed into the seat
Fascination, pipes are glowing in the heat",Formula One,1998
