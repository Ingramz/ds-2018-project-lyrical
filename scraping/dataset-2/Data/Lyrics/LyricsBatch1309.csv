Half past eight

Billy Fury,"Friends, all ask me about you,
You're gone, and they want to know why,
I've stopped, even trying to tell them,
Tears fill my eyes I walk away,
What can I say where can I go
Without your love, what shall I tell them now that you've left me,
What shall I say, what can I do, I'm lost without you.

If I've made, you unhappy,
I'm sorry, for what I've done wrong,
You can't, really mean it's all over,
Give me a chance, don't walk away,
Hear what I say, where can I go

Without your love, what shall I tell them, now that you've left me,
What shall I say, what can I do, I'm lost without you.

If you turn and walk away, don?t come back now,
If you break my heart again, I'll just hate you,
Hate you with every beat, with every beat of my heart,
Oh, I'm lost without you [Repeat: x3]",I'm Lost Without You,1967
Billy Fury,"People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything
My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

Billy Fury,"Jealousy
T'was only through jealousy
Our hearts were broken
Angry words were spoken
Now all I have is memories
To cherish so tenderly
With every token you have given to me

I loved you too well
For I doubted you in my heart
My life was hell
Every moment we were apart
Why did I make
That big mistake
I wronged you right from the start

T'was all over my jealousy
My crime was my blind jealousy
My heart was on fire with desire for you
But I never thought that our love was true

You gave all your kisses to me
But now all too late I can see
The heartaches I caused you
No wonder I lost you
T'was all over my jealousy

You gave all your kisses to me
And now all too late I can see
The heartaches I caused you
No wonder I lost you
Was all over my jealousy
Was all over my jealousy",Jealousy,1967
Billy Fury,"Don't give your love to someone while I'm away,
I want you to think about me each night and day,
And when I come on home after being gone so long,
I want it to be like I've never been gone.

I'll feel your tender kisses before I go to sleep,
I'll feel your arms around me, just promise me,
You'll keep all your love and your kisses until I come home,
And then it'll be like I've never been gone,

I don't ask much of you, do what you want to do,
But, don't make me be a fool for loving you-ooo-ooo.
I'll feel you tender kisses before I go to sleep,
I'll feel your arms around me, just promise me,

You'll keep all your love and your kisses until I come home,
And then it'll be like I've never been gone.
Can't you hear me, like I've never been gone.",Like I've Never Been Gone,1967

Up in the heavenly sky
I only know my heaven is here on earth
Each time you look into my eyes
The way you do baby
Thank you, thank you baby

I held you too tight 
I can see
You're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby
'Cause

Billy Fury,"Once, once upon a dream I met her
Long ago but somehow I can't forget her
I met her, once upon a dream

We built a castle where we planned to live together
Precious moment's in the land of never
I met her once upon a dream

Dreams can come true darling
That's what they say
Prove that you're real
And it's my lucky day

Billy Fury,"Is it true what they're saying about you?
Have you really been untrue?
If it's so, I must go, even though it breaks my heart
Have I given all my world
To somebody else's girl?

Is it true what all my friends are sayin'? (Is it true?)
Is this just a game you've been playin'? (just a game)
Can it be? Please tell me; can't you see I've got to know?
Am I building all my world
On somebody else's girl?

This can't go on; if you're leading me on, I've got to know
I couldn't hold you tight; I wouldn't have the right
If you're his, then tell me so

A magic world in my baby's arms

What a spot in a storm
To cuddle up and stay nice and warm
Away from harm in my baby's arms 
Wondrous place

Man I'm nowhere
When I'm anywhere else
But I don't care
Everything's right when she holds me tight

Her tender hands on my face
I'm in heaven in her embrace
I want to stay and never go away

Billy Fury,"As I was slowly passing, an Orphans home one day,
I stopped for just a little while, to watch the children play,
Alone, a boy was standing, and when I asked him why,
He turned, with eyes, that could not see, and he began to cry,

I'm nobodys child, I'm nobodys child, just like a flower, I'm growing wild,
No Mummys kisses, and no Daddys smile, nobody wants me,
I'm nobodys child.
No Mothers arms to hold me, or sooth me when I cry,

Sometimes it gets so lonesome here, I wish that I could die,
I'd walk the streets of Heaven, where all the blind can see,
And just like all the other kids, Thered be a home for me,
I'm nobodys child, I'm nobodys child, just like a flower, I'm growing wild,

No Mummys kisses, and no Daddys smile, nobody wants me,
I'm no-bodys child.",Nobody's Child,1972

Early in the mornin'
Before the crack of dawn,
Sittin' here thinkin'
Oh why was I born?
So broken hearted,
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

I was so happy
With you by my side,
You told me you loved me,
But honey you lied.
You left me here cryin',
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

The night seems like a million years, mmhm,
Waitin' 'til the break of day appears, oh oh oh.
All night long weepin' like a willow,
Tossin' and turnin' on my tear stained pillow,
Guess I'm gonna drown in my own tears.
Gonna go walkin'
By the railroad track,
I'm gonna let the choo-choo cross over my back.
Life ain't worth livin',
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

The night seems like a million years,

Gonna go walkin'

Smiled down on me
Soft breeze has kissed my cheek
So tenderly
One magic night when dreams come true
Last night was made for love, but where were you?

And though the whispering breeze
Had cast a spell
It seemed the earth stood still
Too late as well
No cloud could hide the moon from view
Last night was made for love, but where were you?

Were you watching that same ol' moon?
In some over fellas arms?
Was he hypnotized with all your many charms
I know there'll never be another time
Another magic night to make you mine

Billy Fury,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2008

Said son when I'm gone don't forget to pray

When I had to pawn my clothes, just to pay my rent
Talkin' 'bout hard times, hard times, oh yeah
Who knows [Incomprehensible] better than I?

I had a woman, Lord, who was always around
But when I lost my money, then she put me down
Talkin' 'bout hard times, you know those hard

And the sea is calm
Lonely shadow, you call upon me

Lay by my side
Fear not tonight
Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light

A place where we can fly away

Ride with me upon a shining star,
Above the moonlit sky
We will find Elysium

Hear the nightingale
Sing a lullaby
Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light

Dawn will be kind,
All will be bright,
Lonely shadow, rise from the darkness

Car pulls up, the doorbell rings
He don't want to go
He thought he'd found his home
But with circumstances he can't change

From the life he's known
For the last seven months or so

Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him
A rambler in his younger days
He knew he made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there
Had he known it

A million thoughts raced through his mind
What's his name, what's he like and will be be
Anything like the man in his dreams
She could see the questions in his eyes
Whispered ""don't be scared my child
I'll let you know, what we know

About the man we found, he looks like you
And cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him
A rambler in his younger days He knew he'd made a few mistakes
But he swore he would've been there Had he known it
You always said that this was something that you wanted
Son it's time to meet your Dad in Oklahoma

One last turn he held his breath
'Til they reached the fifth house on the left
And all at once the tears came rolling in
And as they pulled into the drive
A man was waiting there outside
Who wiped the worry from his eyes Smiled and took his hand

And he said I'm the man who looks like you
Who cried because I never knew
About that boy in pictures that they showed me

The more I believe
It's not the length of the life
Or the depth of the grave
In the end we'll be measured
By the love that we gave

So my time on Earth
On fate depends
But all that happens
In the space we're meant to live

Depends on me
And choices I face
For better or worse
They're mine to make

The more that I know
The more I can see
The older I grow
The more I believe
It's not the length of the life
Or the depth of the grave
In the end we'll be measured
By the love that we gave

So my time on Earth
Will be well spent
And when I leave this world
I'll leave with no regrets

I'll live and love

We must celebrate the gift of life
Every day in some way
We must always remember to play after every storm
All children are truly blessed
With the innocent gifts of gentleness, trust and compassion
To guide the wisdom of the grown-ups
We all have a song in our heart that inspires us in good times and hard times
If we take the time to listen

It matters, it matters, oh, it matters that the world knows

Our senses help discover the hidden and non-hidden
Enchantment in life, if we use them
We must carefully choose our words and wants
Or we could forever hurt others with these dangerous weapons
Strength and value of all things created
Must be measured by character and commitment
Rather than by might and by wealth

It matters, it matters, oh, it matters that the world knows

We must heed the lessons of everyday life
Through the celebration of children and heart songs, senses and words
Or we could lose in our journey to the future

That grow in our hearts

We need to notice, just notice
Notice for a moment
Before the future slips away into ashes and dust of humility

We have, we are, a mosaic of gifts
To nurture, to offer, to accept
We need to be, just be
Be for a moment

Kind and gentle, innocent and trusting
Like children and lambs
Never judging or vengeful

Shakin' off the dust
She could walk the walk
She was one of us
When she went away
I went down that day
Tryin' to cheer her up
Said you won't be missin' much
And all that I remember
When I think of her back then
Is a fast-talkin' fun-lovin' girl we called a friend

Hey little Suzie just got back
She's still wearing her baseball hat
Struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on a count of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
Thinkin' that life just couldn't get better
And when she walked away I noticed
She was lookin' back
I hope I'm the cause of all that

An accidental touch
Never meant so much
Makes me realize that we're not close enough
She used to talk so loud
Now she's whispering
Trying to draw me in
I'm listening
She was always after somethin'
Now I wonder if it's me
Maybe I'm just dreaming
But I call em' as I see em'

Tells me where she's coming from
That it's going somewhere

For a stubborn little voice that said
I didn't have a prayer

I looked into the wings and you were there

Billy Gilman,"A leopard with a harmless kid lay down
And not one savage beast was seen to frown
The wolf with the lamb, can dwell in peace
His grim carnivorous nature there did cease
The lion with the fatling awn did move
And a little child was leading them in love

Long ago there was a young painter
Who had a dream that every creature came
And stood assembled by his side
And he painted the sight that had sweetened his night
For the one hundred times before he died
A kid lion, and a snake, and a child

Wide-eyed and formal and smiling like the sun had stopped
And time had ceased to move
And the wolf and the lamb
Came and ate from his hand
And a man-child was leading them in love

[Chorus:]
Friend have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the old painter sees
In the peaceable kingdom that shines in the faces
Of people from more gentle times than these

I find myself adrift these days
And endless maze of ends and ways
And worlds seem so crazy to be here
But look away, look away
Back or forward from today
To the visions of either fools or sears, oh my

Such a beautiful place
Full of joy, full of grace
It was bathed in our saintly yellow lie
To what learning to know that such things can't be so

I'd hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender

I know I can't survive
Another night away from you
And I'll live again with love
And no they can't take that away from me
And they will see

I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender

Every night's getting longer
And this fire is getting stronger, baby
I'll swallow my pride and I'll be alive
Can't you hear my call
I surrender all

I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I'll hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender

Right here, right now
I give my life to live again
I'll break free, take me
My everything, I surrender all to you, baby

Right now
I my everything I surrender

Billy Gilman,"I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next or scared of having nothing left!

Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
But all I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use

For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

And as I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, somebody's broken heart
In one man soul
And they follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got no place to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
Change
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah, oh no

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see

You can't close your, your mind, the man, the man in the mirror

Billy Gilman,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
Traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way

Yes, it was my way",My Way,2016
Billy Gilman,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
And everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

When we were young

It's hard to admit that
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya

Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya

Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul.

The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown.
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one

To begin with to make you laugh

Will you still have a song to sing 
When the razor boy comes 
And take your fancy things away 
Will you still be singing it 
On that cold and windy day 
You know that the coming is so close at hand 
You feel all right 
I guess only women in cages can stand 
This kind of night 
I guess only women in cages 
Can play down 
The things they lose 
You think no tomorrow will come 
When you lay down 
You can't refuse

WITH BILLY GRAY
WRITERS BILLY GRAY, CHUCK HARDING, MARTY ROBERTS, MARK THOMPSON

You've got the clothes and everything to make you look
Just like a king,
But you can't, no you can't have my love.
You've got a big automobile and a chauffeur at the wheel,
But you can't No you can't have my love.
You think all you have to do is call and I will run to you.
Well listen while I break the news, I'm not the gal that shines your shoes.
[CHORUS]
So with your money
Clothes, and cars,
You ain't the cat
You think you are.
And you can't,
No you can't have my love.
[man's voice]
Well hello there sweetheart.
You ain't got no business out here in this cotton field,
And that beatsack skirt
And that hand-me-down shirt.
Now, why don't you listen to me, baby.
I'd dress you up in the finest silks and satins,
And you know I'd perfume you up right nice with
Powder and clothes.
Now you know,
I don't know why I even fool around with you anyway.
There's a brunette up in Tulsa
Who cries for me.
And there's that blonde
Down in Nashville, Tennessee,
And that redhead down in Dallas,
She really loves me.
Now what's the matter with you anyway gal?
Just because you're from Oklahoma,
With sand in your hair.
You know I'm a good mind just to drive off
And leave you standing there
[end man's voice]
So get that big long Cadillac,
Hit the road and don't come back.
Don't show me that roll of bills,
'Cause it won't lead me from these hills.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1990
Billy Higgins,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Billy Higgins,"Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny

Billy Hufsey,"White people are so scared of black people
They bulldoze out to the country
And put up houses on little loop-dee-loop streets
And while america gets its heart cut right out of its chest
The Berlin wall still runs down main street
Separating east side from west
And nothing is stirring, not even a mouse
In the boarded-up stores and the broken-down houses
So they hang colorful banners off all the street lamps
Just to prove they got no manners
No mercy and no sense

And I'm wondering what it will take
For my city to rise
First we admit our mistakes
Then we open our eyes
The ghosts of old buildings are haunting parking lots
In the city of good neighbors that history forgot

I remember the first time I saw someone
Lying on the cold street
I thought: I can't just walk past here
This can't just be true
But I learned by example
To just keep moving my feet
It's amazing the things that we all learn to do

So we're led by denial like lambs to the slaughter
Serving empires of style and carbonated sugar water
And the old farm road's a four-lane that leads to the mall
And our dreams are all guillotines waiting to fall

I'm wondering what it will take
For my country to rise
First we admit our mistakes
And then we open our eyes

Pretty girls digging

Inside outside. Nowhere is home.
Inside outside, Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the five fifteen.

Slowly sinking.
On the back of a lorry
Holy hitching.

Born in the war
Birthday punching.

Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down.
Bell Boy! Carry this baggage out.
Bell Boy! Always running at someone's heel.

Remember when stars were in reach.
Then I wander in early to work,
Spend the day licking boots for my perks.

Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell.

Billy Jack Gafford,"It was on a day like no other
Seeking your face when I discovered
My life was no longer my own, but yours
Then I heard you say, ""Go and tell them
To open your heart, let me in and I will supply your every need.""
Then I cried, ""Lord, I don't know if I can do it.""
""You will find your strength in me. Only believe.""
Then I said, ""What if I fail? I just couldn't take it""
He said, ""I have given you my ability.""

[Chorus:]
For the sake of the call
I am laying down my all
No turning back
Moving straight ahead
I'm on the right track
And it's all for the sake of the call

Sister, let me encourage your heart
Brother, leave doubt behind, stay your part
Know that he's with you, yes, he's there all the time
You may feel like you can't go on any longer
Though you are weak, remember he's stronger
Through Him you can do most anything
You might cry ""Lord I don't know if I can do it""
You will find your strength in him only believe
You might say, ""What if I fail? I just couldn't take it.""
He has given you the ability

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Wanna laugh like a loon

Then a baby I will, you know that I will

And losing his heart was such an easy thing to do
He fell in love so deep with magic that they feel
But when he realized he couldn't hold her it, finally drove him mad

Now he don't know when he lost her
He don't know that she's not there
And he don't know that it's over
Best of all he don't know that she don't care

Now he shows her old photograph to each new friend he finds
The writing on the back has long since faded out with time
But his heart remembers every word and his eyes still see the love
And in his mind he's still the one that she is dreamin' of

Now he don't know when he lost her

You started turning up in sad songs
It should have hit me when
You began to sing along

There were tears in your eyes
Every time a song was through
It was more than the music
I was losing you

I should have seen it when
You started watchin' those late, late movies
And you'd sleep on the couch
Instead of sleeping next to me

When I'd wake up in the night
Sometimes I'd hear you cry but, baby, I never knew
It was more than the movies
I was losing you

I wish you had screamed
And yelled out the things you held deep inside
'Cause I never dreamed
That our love was dyin' right before my eyes

But I should have felt it on
Those too few nights I held you
Oh, I should have known
All those whispered words weren't true

There was a reason why you never looked in my eyes
And it breaks my heart in two

I want to hold you just one more time

Don't look back I want to remember you just like this

And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today

And some satisfied women behind

Say ""I'm easy come,easy go and easy to love when I stay""

Locked horns with the devil himself

No one got home but they got on

There's a little piece of yesterday still in her eye

Rounded out and made to move along

Just swings a rope and rides inside a song

Dead limbs play with ringless fingers 
A melody which burns you deep inside
Oh, how the song becomes the singers
May peace be ever with you as you ride 

How long will you be driven relentless around the world
The blood in the rhythm of the soul

In the window candles glowing 
Remind you that today you are a child
Road ahead, forever rolling

Roulette eyes reflecting another morning lost
Hauled in by the metro for killing time and pain 
With a singing brakeman screaming through your veins

Way back in sixty five
Mama would pray and say, he's my baby
Lord, please keep him alive

Sister came home with two little children
Her man had left her alone
Mama knew too well the hurt she was feelin'
'Cause daddy had been gone so long

We all did our part to add to her pain
We all broke her heart but she never complained

She loved a lot in her time
She watched love grow and die on the vine
She stood in the shadows
So others could shine
She loved a lot in her time

Mama's prayers were answered a long time ago
I ain't touched a drink in ten years
Sister remarried to a good ol' boy
They don't live far from here

Mama's work is done
Now, she's gone on home
The words in our hearts
Are engraved on her stone

Don't let me wait.

You Catholic girls start much too late.

Ah! But sooner or later it comes down to fate.

I might as well will be the one.


Well they showed you a statue-

Told you to pray.

They built you a temple and locked you away.

Ah! But they never told you the price it would pay.

The things that you might have done...


Only the good die young.

That's what I said!

Only the good die young.

Only the good die young...


You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd.

We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud.

We might be laughin' a bit too loud.

Ah! But that never hurt no one...


So come on Virginia!

Show me a sign-

Send up a signal; I'll throw you a line.

The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind-

Never lets in the sun...


Darlin' only the good die young!

Oh woe woe woe woe!

I tell ya only the good die young.

Only the good die young...


You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation!

You've got a brand new soul.

Mmm, and a cross of gold.

But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information!


You didn't count on me-

When you were counting on your rosary.

Oh woe woe!


And they say there's a Heaven,

And those who will wait.

And some say it's better,

But I say it ain't!

I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.


The sinners are much more fun...

You know that only the good die young!

Oh woe woe baby bay!

I tell ya only the good die young!

Only the good die young...


Said your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation!

Ah! She never cared for me.

But did she ever say a prayer for me?

Oh woe woe!


Come out, come out, come out!

You Catholic girls start much too late!

Sooner or later it comes down to fate.

I might as well will be the one...

You know that only the good die young!

You know that only the good die young!

And you can always have your way somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
 
You can walk away from your mistakes 
You can turn your back on what you do 
Just a little smile is all it takes 
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too

Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore 
 
So your life is only living anyhow 
And everybody loves you now 
 
Close your eyes when you don't want to see 
Stay at home when you don't want to go 
Only speak to those who will agree 
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know 
 
You have lost you innocence somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
 
Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever 
And it's all been done before 
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor 
No more 
 
See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl?

Sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong
Just to have something to say

I know the moment isn't right
To tell the girl a comical line
To keep the conversation light
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind

But if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

Yes I know I'm in love
But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth
'Cause I'm just avoiding the facts

If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide

And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real

There would still be music left to write

That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time

Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances

And she's always there for you 
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Tell her all your crazy dreams

You're always insecure 
And there's only one good way 
To reassure 

Tell her about it 
Let her know how much you care 
When she can't be with you 
Tell her you wish you were there 

Tell her about it 
Every day before you leave 
Pay her some attention 
Give her something to believe 

'Cause now and then 
She'll get to worrying

Will that be a consolation when she's gone

It's good information from a man 
Who's made mistakes 

Just a word or two that she gets from you 
Could be the difference that it makes 

She's a trusting soul 
She's put her trust in you 
But a girl like that won't tell you 
What you should do 

Tell her about it 
Tell her everything you feel 
Give her every reason 
To accept that you're for real 

Tell her about it 
Tell her all your crazy dreams 
Let her know you need her 
Let her know how much she means 

Tell her about it 
Tell her how you feel right now 
Tell her about it

You got to tell her about it 
Tell her now and you won't go wrong 
You got to tell her about it 
Before it gets too late

Through a three inch speaker.
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs,
You were all getting sick on beer-
And you didn't get any (unless you went steady and made out for a year).

Well you can hide away honey, in your rock and roll dreams,
You can stand by your blue suede shoes-
But the party is over,
And I'm getting tired of waiting for you.

Oh baby, ""Where are the oldies they used to play?""
Oh baby, you want to crawl back into yesterday,
You don't want to deal with the future,
You don't want to make any plans-
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.
",All You Wanna Do Is Dance,1976
Billy Joel,"From a town known as Wheeling West Virginia
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande

Well he started with a bank in Colorado
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid
And his age and his size took the teller by surprise
And word spread of Billy the Kid

Well he never traveled heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put other older guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart
And he never had a home
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served his legend well
For the folks they'd love to tell 'bout when Billy the Kid came to town

Well one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said ""String 'I'm up for what he did!""
And the cowboys and their kin like the sea, came pourin' in to watch the hangin' of Billy the Kid

Well he never traveled heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put other older guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart
But he finally found a home
Underneath the boot hill grave that bears his name

From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time

Billy Joel,"Baby all the lights are turned on you
Now you're in the center of the stage
Everything revolves on what you do
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age

And you can always have your way somehow
But everybody loves you now

You can walk away from your mistakes
You can turn your back on what you do
Just a little smile is all it takes
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too

Loneliness will get to you somehow
But everybody loves you now

Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry
So do I

All the people want to know your name
Soon there will be lines outside your door
Feelings do not matter in your game
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore

So your life is only living anyhow
And everybody loves you now

Close your eyes when you don't want to see
Stay at home when you don't want to go
Only speak to those who will agree
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know

You have lost you innocence somehow
But everybody loves you now

Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever
And it's all been done before
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor
No more

See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl?
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall

This is what you wanted; ain't you proud?
Cause everybody loves you now",Everybody Loves You Now,1976
Billy Joel,"Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.",Falling of the Rain,1976
Billy Joel,"Well so here I am at the end of the road
Where do I go from here?
I always figured it would be like this
Still nothing seems to be quite clear

All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled
But I just can't decide where to go
Yes, it's been quite a day and I should go to sleep
But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know

That I've got to begin again
Though I don't know how to start
Yes, I've got to begin again
And it's hard

Well it's been quite a while since I lifted my head
And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes
I see the way that I been spendin' my days
And reality has caught me by surprise

I was dreamin' of tomorrow so I sacrificed today
And it sure was a grand waste of time
And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face
I just can't get you out of my mind

So nonchalant 
And spend our nights 
So Bon vivant 
We dress our days 
In silken robes 
The money comes 
The money goes 
We know it's all a passing phase,

We light our lamps 
For atmosphere 
And hang our hopes 
On chandeliers 
We're going long 
We're gaining weight 
We're sleeping long 
And far too late 
And so it's times 
To change our ways 
But I've loved these days. 

Now as we indulge 
In things refined 
We hide our hearts 
From harder times 
A string of pearls 
A foreign car 
Oh we can only go so far 
On caviar and Cabernay. 

We drown our doubts 
In dry champagne 
And soothe our souls 
With fine cocaine 
I don't know why I ever care 
We'll get so high 
And get nowhere 
We'll have to change our jaded ways,
But I've loved these days. 

So before we end 
And then begin 
We'll drink a toast to how it's been

Billy Joel,"Seen the lights go out Broadway
I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs
And left there long ago

They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
But we went right on with the show

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on Forty second street

They burned the churches down in Harlem
Like in that Spanish civil war
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
It always burned up there before

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the battery
The union went on strike
They never sailed at all

They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
And blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea

You know those lights were bright on Broadway
That was so many years ago
Before we all lived here in Florida
Before the Mafia took over Mexico
There are not many who remember
They say a handful still survive
To tell the world about
The way the lights went out
And keep the memory alive",Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway),1976

Billy Joel,"They say that these are not the best of times
But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own

Now I have seen that sad surrender in my mother's eyes
I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
Its either sadness or euphoria

So we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same

Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
A reason coexists with our insanity
Though we choose between reality and madness
Its either sadness or euphoria

How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities
Its either sadness or euphoria","Summer, Highland Falls",1976

That's my home

Home could be the Pennsylvania turnpike 
Indiana's early morning dew 
High up in the hills of California 
Home is just another word for you 

Well I never had a place that I could call my very own 
But that's all right my love 'cause you're my home 

If I travel all my life 
And I never get stop and settle down 
Long as I have you by my side 
There's a roof above and good walls all around 
You're my castle, you're my cabin 
And my instant pleasure dome 
I need you in my house 
'Cause you're my home
You're my home",You're My Home,1976
Billy Joel,"While in these days of quiet desperation
As I wander through the world in which I live
I search everywhere, for some new inspiration
But it's more than cold reality can give

If I need a cause for celebration
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind
I rely on my imagination
And I dream of an imaginary time 

[Chorus: ]
I know that everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
And this is my dream, my own
Just to be at home
And to be all alone...with you 

If I believe in all the words I'm saying
And if a word from you can bring a better day
Then all I have are these games that I've been playing
To keep my hope from crumbling away

So let me lie and let me go on sleeping
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand
And all the fantasies that I have been keeping
Will make the empty hours easier to stand 

[Chorus: ]

Everybody has a dream... (Repeat)",Everybody Has a Dream,1977
Billy Joel,"I don't believe in first impressions
For just this once I hope that looks don't deceive

Got to meet that girl somehow
I've gotta get it right the first time
That's the main thing, oohh oohh
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing, ooh ooh
Gonna have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la (Repeat)

I'm not much good at conversation
I was never to smooth at comin' on real strong
If all it takes is inspiration
Then I might have just what it takes
If I don't make no bad mistakes and I get it right the first time

Can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing

I might get up the nerve
But if my timing ain't just right
What purpose would it serve?
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know how to say those first few words
If I want to put myself in touch
The first few moments mean so much

So I suppose it's now or never
Before that woman walks right out of my life
Just let me pull myself together
I've got to give it one good try
Gotta take my chance tonight
I've gotta get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass

Tired of living in your one horse town 
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground 
For awhile...

So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans 
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens 
It's like some pornographic magazine 
And you smile 

[Chorus : ] 
Captain Jack will get you high tonight 
And take you to your special island 
Captain Jack will get you by tonight 
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin' 

Oh yeah,... 

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date 
You just sit at home and masturbate 
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait 
For that call 

So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes 
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes 
Ah, but still your fingers gonna pick your nose 
After all...

[Chorus: ] 

So you decide to take a holiday 
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet 
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway 
What for? 

So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool 
They just found your father in the swimming pool 
And you guess you won't be going back to school 
Anymore. 

[Chorus: ] 

So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot 
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot 
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got 
What went wrong? 

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead 
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head 
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long

So bon vivant

We light our lamps 
For atmosphere 
And hang our hopes 
On chandeliers

In things refined 
We hide our hearts 
From harder times

Oh we can only go so far 
On caviar and Cabernay

We drown our doubts 
In dry champagne 
And soothe our souls 
With fine cocaine 
I don't know why I ever care 
We'll get so high 
And get nowhere 
We'll have to change our jaded ways... 
But I've loved these days

So before we end 
And then begin 
We'll drink a toast to how it's been

And tight blue jeans

Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom
Riding around with the car top
Down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the
Parkway Diner

Than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would
Always know how to survive

Steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would
Be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
""Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life""
But there we were, wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye

They got an apartment with deep
Pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought
With the bread
They had saved for a couple
Of years
They started to fight when the
Money got tight
And they just didn't count on
The tears

They lived for a while in a
Very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter
Of course
And they parted the closest
Of friends
Then the king and the queen went
Back to the green
But you can never go back
There again

Brenda and Eddie had had it
Already by the summer of '75
From the high  to the low to
The end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to
The greasers
The best they could do was
Pick up the pieces
We always knew they would both
Find a way to get by
That's all I heard about
Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I
Told you already

You've been locked outside the door

With your insides bleedin'

Billy Joel,"I never ask you where you go
After I leave you in the morning
We go our different ways to separate situations
It's not that easy anymore

Today I do what must be done
I give my time to total strangers
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever
MOre than it ever did before

CHORUS
Until the night, until the night
I just might make it
Until the night, until the night
When I see you again

Now you're afraid that we have changed
And I'm afraid we're getting older
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces
So many lovers come and gone

I'll have my fears like every man
You'll have your tears like every woman
Today we'll be unsure, is this what we believe in
And wonder how can we go on

CHORUS

When the sun goes down
And the day is over
When the last of the light has gone
As they pour into the street
I will be getting closer
As the cars turn their headlights on
While they're closing it down
We're gonna open it up
And while they're going to sleep
We'll just be starting to touch
I'm just beginning to feel
I'm just beginning to give
I'm just beginning to feel
I'm just beginning to live
Before I leave you again
Before the light of the dawn
Before this evening can end
I have been waiting so long

Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style
Ali don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free

Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me

I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be

Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headline every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see

Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign
She's gonna give the go head
The inning isn't over yet for me, for me

I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be

Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar
I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer

Billy Joel,"She stood on the tracks
Waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail, SHOCK
Quick as a wink
She changed her mind

She gave me a night
That?s all it was
What will it take until I STOP
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa

There?s nothing else I can do
?Cause I?m doing it All For Leyna
I don?t want anyone new
?Cause I?m living it All For Leyna
There?s nothing in it for you
?Cause I?m giving it all to Leyna

We laid on the beach
Watching the tide
She didn?t tell me there were, ROCKS
Under the waves
Right off the shore

Washed up on the sand
Barely alive
Wishing the undertow would, STOP
How can a man take anymore, whoa

There?s nothing else I can do
?Cause I?m doing it All For Leyna
I don?t want anyone new
?Cause I?m living it All For Leyna
There?s nothing in it for you
?Cause I?m giving it all to Leyna

I?m failing in school
Loosing my friends
Making my family loose their minds
I don?t want to eat
I don?t want to sleep
I only want Leyna, one more time

Now, I?m in my room
Watching the tube
Telling myself, she still may, DROP
Over to say, she?s changed her mind

So, I wait in the dark
Listening for her
Instead of hearing my old man saying, STOP
Kidding yourself, wasting your time

There?s nothing else I can do
?Cause I?m doing it All For Leyna
I don?t want anyone new
?Cause I?m living it All For Leyna
There?s nothing in it for you

In this smoky place
With my brandy eyes

Here I go again
Looking for your face
And I realize
That I should look for someone else
But you were the one
You were the one

Que je devrais en chercher une autre

Billy Joel,"Blackout, heatwave, .44 caliber homicide
The bums drop dead and dogs gone mad
In packs on the West Side
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide
She wants to hit those bricks
Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound
I don't want to hear it but he won't turn it down
Life is tough but it's just enough
To hold back the tears until it's closing time
I survived, I'm still alive
But I'm getting close to the borderline
Close to the borderline

A buck three eighty
Won't buy you much lately on the street these days
And when you can get gas
You know you can't drive fast anymore on the parkways
Rich man, poor man, either way American
Shoved into the lost and found
The no nuke yell we're gonna all go to hell
With the next big meltdown
I got remote control and a color T.V.
I don't change channels so they must change me
I got real close friends that will get me high
They don't know how to talk and they ain't gonna try
I shouldn't bitch, I shouldn't cry
I'd start a revolution but I don't have time
I don't know why I'm still a nice guy
But I'm getting close to the borderline
Close to the borderline

I thought I'd sacrifice so many things
I thought I'd throw them all away
I didn't think I needed anything
But you can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay

I need a doctor for my pressure pills
I need a lawyer for my medical bills
I need a banker to finance my home
But I need security to back my loan

But everybody knows you got to break sometime

But I'm getting closer to the borderline

Billy Joel,"She said she'd meet me in the bar
At the Plaza hotel
Wear a jacket and a tie
What's the occasion
She just smiled and she wouldn't say why
So here I am standing waiting in the lobby
Sweating bullets in this stupid old suit
And when she sees me, she busts out laughing
You're a sad sight honey but you look so cute, and

(CHORUS):
I don't want to be alone anymore
I was checking you out
I was just making sure
No, I don't want to be alone anymore
And I want you tonight
Although you hurt me before
It didn't matter that I felt like a fool
'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door
I said I'm sorry but she said it was cool
And I don't want to be alone anymore

It's so confusing choosing sides
In the heat of the moment
Just to see if it's real
It's so erotic having you
Tell me how it should feel
But I'm avoiding all the hard cold facts
That I've got to face
So ask me just one question
When this magic night is through
Could it have been just anyone
Or did it have to be you
And will you still be saying

(CHORUS)

But don't you know that it's wrong
It's wrong, it's wrong

But I'm willing to try
As long as you can tell me

Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby-blue Continental""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town, but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""Well, you could really be a Beau Brummel, baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that their out of touch?""
Well, should I try to be a straight-A student?
""If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?

Through the long night with you

I almost lost you
A long, long time ago
Oh, you should have told me
But you had to bleed to know

All your past sins
Are since past
You should be sleeping

Sleep tight
Through the long night with me

No, I didn't start it

Is all that I need to know

I don't even know why
Why can't people
Find something better to do

I don't believe what they say
I heard them talk
They say you've been putting me down
In the shadows on the phone
They won't leave us alone
They've been talking
Ever since you came around

Careless talk
Telling you I'm doing wrong
Jealous talk
Follows wherever you go

I'm aware of what you heard
Every terrible word
Everybody's making believe that they know
All of the intimate things
That we ever might have said

In the heat of a passionate moment
In a conversation shared
For the ears of nobody else
There are some things they will never hear
There are secrets I'll never tell

About a woman and a man
Maybe you will find familiar
Maybe you won't understand

The man's name I don't remember
He was always Joe to me
But I can't forget the woman
She was always Christie Lee

He was working in a night club
That's where he played the saxophone
He used to fake to stock arrangements
He left the customers alone

But one night before the last song
About a quarter after three
He saw her standing at the coat check
And made his move on Christie Lee

Christie Lee, Christie Lee
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

She was a nice piece of music
She had a rhythm all her own
He blew a solo like a blind man
She really dug his saxophone

She wanted more than just an encore
And he could play in every key
He left the stage and packed his alto
And he took it home with Christie Lee

Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the bible
You know the man could blow an educated axe
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman
Who didn't need another lover
All she wanted was the sax

It took a while for him to notice
It took a while for him to see
He was never in control here
It was always Christie Lee

Christie Lee, Christie Lee
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

Oh the man took a calculated gamble
Yes the man had the power to perform
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle
She didn't need him as a man
All she wanted was the horn

They say that Joe became a wino
They say he always drinks alone
They say he stumbles like a blind man
They say he sold his saxophone

Even the band must face the music
That's what the moral is to me
The only time you hit the high note
Is when you play for Christie Lee

I've been around 
Someone like me should know better
Falling in love 
Would be the worst thing I could do
Didn't I say 
I needed time to forget her?
Aren't you running 
From someone who's not over you?

How many nights 
Have I been lonely without you?
I tell myself 
How much I really don't care
How many nights 
Have I been thinking about you?
Wanting to hold you 
But knowing you would not be there

But this night you're mine
It's only you and I
I'll tell you to forget yesterday
This night we are together

This night is mine
It's only you and I

Ooh

I reach out
For someone to hold

Spent them fast enough

They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in

And I'm weary

Billy Joel,"You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper
With her high top sneakers of Italian design
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind

Now you're in trouble, maybe she's an intellectual
What if she figures out you're not very smart
Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal
Boy, you got to get it settled
Cause she's breaking your heart

Don't try to put on an act
You can't do that to a modern woman
And you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

She looks sleek and she seems so professional
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see
You want to make a move
But you feel so inferior
Cause under that exterior
Is someone who's free

She's got style and she's got her own money
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm
She's got the eyes that make you realize
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm

You've got your plan of attack
That won't attract the modern woman
Whe you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy

But times have changed
Things are not the same, baby
You overcame such a bad attitude
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks
And nowadays it's politics
And after 1986 what else could be new

You got to learn to relax
And face the facts of modern woman
And you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman",Modern Woman,1988

Billy Joel,"Well I'm on the Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound

We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
And left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep

I've got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I've got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trawling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my Downeaster ""Alexa""
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they tell me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here.

I was a bayman like my father was before
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me","Downeaster ""Alexa"" [Live]",1990

Billy Joel,"Safe at harbor, everything is easy
Off to starboard, daylight comes up fast
Now I'm restless for the open water
Red flags are flying fromhe Coast Guard mast
They told me to stay, I heard all the information
I motored away and steered straight ahead
Though the weatherman said

CHORUS
There's a storm front coming (mood indigo)
White water running and the pressure is low
Storm front coming (mood indigo)
Small craft warning on the radio

I've been sailing a long time on this ocean
Man gets lonesome, all those years at sea
I've got a woman, my life should be easy
Most men hunger for the life I lead
The morning was gray, but I had the motivation
I drifted away and ran into more
Heavy weather off shore

CHORUS

We've got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze
We've got a falling barometer and rising seas
We've got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale
We've got a force nine blowing on the Beaufort scale

I'm still restless for the open water
Though she gives me everything I need
She asked me to stay, but I'd done my navigation
I drove her away, but I should have known
To stay tied up at home

Billy Joel,"Some people think 
That she's one of those mink-coated ladies
They say she wakes up at one
And makes the paparazzi run till dawn
She wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn

That's not her style I can tell you
That ain't my woman
It's just not her style I can tell you
Because I'm her man

The papers say 
She was seen in L.A. with a stranger
She found a perfect body 
With a Maserati right outside

And then she chartered a Lear
When she heard her career was in danger
And gave the pilot 
Somethin' extra for a perfect ride

That ain't my woman
It's just not her style I can tell you
Because I'm her man

It's just that she's better 
At doing whatever suits her style
And that's not her style

I've read where it's said 
That she sleeps in a bed made of satin
She's had her face done in every place you can try
They say she gets a piece 

Of every lease in Manhattan
And says she's thirty 
When she's really pushing forty-five

Billy Joel,"There's a place in the world  for the angry young man

He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was right or wrong. 

And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
His honor is pure, and his courage as well 
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man.

Billy Joel,"One, two, one, two, three, four

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us
Cause it's always been a matter of trust

I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof
But you're going to face a moment of truth
It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
It's a matter of trust

You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for god's sake don't shut me out

This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it, whatever you choose
I won't hold back anything
And I'll walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until its only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust

I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong

Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start

But that can't happen to us

It's all or nothing at all

Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

And if I stand of I fall
It's all or nothing at all

Billy Joel,"Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above
Making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Than to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I've not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me I'll understand

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below
Anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began

Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man",An Innocent Man,1992

Billy Joel,"Victor was born 
The spring of '44 
And never saw 
His father anymore 
The child of sacrifice 
Child of war 
Another son who never had 
A father after Leningrad 
Went off to school 
And learned to serve his state 
Follow the rules 
And drank his vodka straight 
The only way to live 
Was drown the hate 
The Russian life was very sad 
And such was life in Leningrad 

I was born in '49 
A cold war kid in the McCarthy times
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel 
Blast those yellow reds to hell 
Cold war kids were hard to kill 
Under their desks in an air raid drill 
Haven't they heard we won the war 
What do they keep on fighting for? 

Victor was sent 
To some red army town 
Served out his time 
Become a circus clown 
The greatest happiness 
He'd ever found 
Was making Russian children glad 
When children lived in Leningrad. 

The children lived in Levittown 
Hid in the shelters underground 
Til the soviets turned their ships around 
Torn the Cuban missiles down 
And in that bright October sun 
We knew our childhood days were done 
I watched my friends go off to war 
What do they keep on fighting for? 
  
So my child and I came to this place 
To meet him , eye to eye and face to face 
He made my daughter laugh 
Then we embraced 
We never knew what friends we had 
Until we came to Leningrad.",Leningrad,1992
Billy Joel,"She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence 
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain 
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments 
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain

It's all about soul 
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion 
It's all about soul 
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion 
She's got to be strong 
'Cause so many things getting out of control 
Should drive her away 
So why does she stay?
It's all about soul

She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming 
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away 
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say

It's all about soul
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling 
The woman's got soul 
The power of love and the power of healing 
This life isn't fair 
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold 
You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough 
It's all about soul

There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness 
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive

It's all about soul 
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow 
It's all about soul 
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow 
You've got to be hard 
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll 
But that's only part, you know in your heart 
It's all about soul",All About Soul,1993
Billy Joel,"Some days when I'm far away
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution
In hell there's a big hotel
Where the bar just closed and the windows never opened
No phone so you can't call home
And the TV works, but the clicker is broken
But in the darkness I see your light turned on
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to

CHORUS
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
One word from you is all I need to be inspired
Blonde over blue
I need your inspiration tonight

These days there's a million ways
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected
These times there are sins and crimes
On the morning shows for the disconnected
I look and I write my book
And I walk away with the wrong impressions
I don't care 'cause I've done my share
And I need some time for my own obsessions
It doesn't matter, I've let that life go by
It's been forgotten 'cause all I wanted was you

CHORUS

These days not a damn soul prays
ANd there is no faith 'cause there's nothing to believe in
THese days only good luck pays
If we don't get paid then we try to get even
I look and I write my book
And I have my say and I draw conclusions
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution
But in the darkness I see your light turned on
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to

Billy Joel,"Sitting here in Avalon, looking at the pouring rain
Summertime has come and gone and everybody's home again

Closing down for the season, I found the last of the souvenirs
I can still taste the wedding cake and it's sweet after all these years

These are the last words I have to say
That's why this took so long to write
There will be other words some other day
But that's the story of my life

There's comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall
They're pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall
They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade
Nothing left for a dream now, only one final serenade

And these are the last words I have to say
Before another age goes by
With all those other songs I'll have to play
But that's the story of my life

And it's so clear standing here where I am
Ain't that what justice is for?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn anymore

Stack the chairs on the table tops
Hang the sheets on the chandeliers
It slows down but it never stops
Ain't it sweet after all these years

And these are the last words I have to say
It's always hard to say goodbye
But now it's time to put this book away
And that's the story of my life

These are the last words I have to say
That's why this took so long to write
There will be other words some other day
Ain't that the story of my life

These are the last words I have to say
Before another age goes by
With all those other songs I'll have to play
Ain't that the story of my life",Famous Last Words,1993
Billy Joel,"Advice is cheap you can take it from me
It's your's to keep cause opinions are free
Nobody knows about the trouble I've seen
Nobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean
It coasts too much and takes too long to find out too late
Some words aren't heard 'til after they're spoken
Your role was protective, your soul was too defective
Some people just don't have a heart to be broken

We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
If you only had a little more faith in me
In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum 
reminders will still shine bright
All the king's men and all the king's horse
Can't put you together the way you used to be
We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China

You take a piece of whatever you touch
Too many pieces means you're touching too much
You never win if you can't play it straight
You only beat me if you get me to hate
It must be so lonely to think that you have only
Somebody elses life to live if they let you
I ain't too selective, but it don't take no detective
To find out how fast your friends will forget you 

We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
Now all you're going to be is history
Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight
You coulda had class, you coulda been a contender
Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me
You could have been standing, standing on the Great Wall of China

This was not your calling, just look how far you've fallen
I heard your story, man, you've got to be joking
Keep things in perspective, this is my true objective
Why tear this heart out if it's only been broken?

We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China

Billy Joel,"Some days I have to give right in to the blues
Despite how I try to keep fightin'
It's a sure shot I'm going to lose
And I'll tell you why
You think I'm crazy
It's such a sad composition
But can you blame me
For what's been causing my bad disposition?
Ain't nothing new with my blue situation
And nothing's fine, it's just a minor variation

When troubles want to find me, I ain't hard to find
They know where I am
Like a hungry pack of wolves when it's feeding time
They tear up a man
And it's a strange thing
""Cause now it don't really matter
More of the same thing
Don't even hurt it's been part of the pattern
But still in all it's a small consulation
I just define it as a minor variation

Ain't now way to fight 'em darling
Ain't no way around 'em baby
Ain't now way to take 'em honey
Nowhere to hide and believe me I've tried to shake 'em

I'm getting to the point where I don't feel the pain
And I've had enough
I'm ready for the next time it hits me again
""Cause I've gotten tough
It doesn't faze me
And now I've made my decision
I may be crazy
It's not as though I don't know that condition
Until I'm through with this blue situation
Pass me the wine, it's just a minor variation

Ain't nobody's business, baby
Ain't nobody's worry darlin'
Ain't nobody's problem
No way to win when you've already been forgotten

And it's a strange thing
""Cause now it don't really matter
More of the same thing
Don't even hurt, it's a part of the pattern
Until I'm through with this blue situation
Pass me the wine, it's just a minor variation

Billy Joel,"In the beginning
There was the cold and the night
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light
Man was triumphant
Armed with the faith and the will
Even the darkest ages couldn't kill

Too many kingdoms
Too many flags on the field
So many battles, so many wounds to be healed
Time is relentless
Only true love perseveres
It's been a long time and now I'm with you
After two thousand years

This is our moment
Here at the crossroads of time
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line
They are the vintage
What kind of life will they live?
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?

Sometimes I wonder
Why are we so blind to fate?
Without compassion, there can be no end to hate
No end to sorrow
Caused by the same endless fears
Why can't we learn from all we've been through
After two thousand years?

There will be miracles
After the last war is won
Science and poetry rule in the new world to come
Prophets and angels
Gave us the power to see
What an amazing future there will be

And in the evening
After the fire and the light
One thing is certain: Nothing can hold back the night
Time is relentless
And as the past disappears
We're on the verge of all things new
We are two thousand years",Two Thousand Years,1993

To a river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side

Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night",River of Dreams,1994
Billy Joel,"Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!


Some things were perfectly clear, seen with the vision of youth

No doubts and nothing to fear, I claimed the corner on truth

These days it's harder to say I know what I'm fighting for

My faith is falling away

I'm not that sure anymore


Shades of grey wherever I go

The more I find out the less that I know

Black and white is how it should be

But shades of grey are the colors I see


Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!


Once there were trenches and walls and one point of every view

Fight 'til the other man falls

Kill him before he kills you

These days the edges are blurred, I'm old and tired of war

I hear the other man's words

I'm not that sure anymore


Shades of grey are all that I find

When I look to the enemy line

Black and white was so easy for me

But shades of grey are the colors I see


Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!


Now with the wisdom of years I try to reason things out

And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts

Save us all from arrogant men, and all the causes they're for

I won't be righteous again

I'm not that sure anymore


Shades of grey are all that I find

When I look to the enemy line

There ain't no rainbows shining on me

Shades of grey are the colors I see


Shades of grey wherever I go

The more I find out the less that I know

There ain't no rainbows shining on me

Shades of grey are the colors I see

Billy Joel,"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feeling alright",Piano Man,1995
Billy Joel,"She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain

It's all about soul
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion
It's all about soul
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion
She's got to be strong
'Cause so many things getting out of control
Should drive her away
So why does she stay?
It's all about soul

She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say

It's all about soul
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling
The woman's got soul
The power of love and the power of healing
This life isn't fair
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold
You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough
It's all about soul

There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive

It's all about soul
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow
It's all about soul
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow
You've got to be hard
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll
But that's only part, you know in your heart

Billy Joel,"Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line
Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers in the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coal
And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child has a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our place

Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be giving up today

And we're living here in Allentown",Allentown,1997
Billy Joel,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows",And So It Goes,1997
Billy Joel,"Well, you went uptown riding in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
And when you wake up in the morning
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You and to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained
Oh, but now you just don't remember
All the things you said
And you're not sure you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you

Billy Joel,"Saturday night and you're still hangin' around
Tired of living in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For awhile

So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

Oh yeah

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
You just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon,
But you just can't wait
For that call

So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose
After all

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
What for

So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool
They just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

Every drunk must have his drink

Just take your chances

Still you're standing on your feet
All your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete
Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

You can say the human heart is only make believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire

All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street
Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away

And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound

We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster Alexa
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep

I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster Alexa
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they tell me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in sword fishing here

I was a bay man like my father was before
Can't make a living as a bay man anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me

I learned by doin' twice

Still they want their say

You gotta make it fit

On Parris Inland
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung
ho to lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
but our bellies were tight

We had no homefront
We had no soft soap
They sent us playboy
They gave us bob hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ
with all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our Doors tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held onto each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong
And who was right
It didn't matter
in the thick of the fight

We, held the day
In the palm of our hands
They, ruled the night
And the night, seemed to last
as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline
They held the highland
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of the mortars
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together",Goodnight Saigon,1997

I promised I would never leave you
Then you should always know
Wherever you may go, no matter where you are
I never will be far away

Goodnight my angel, now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep, inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Goodnight my angel, now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me
Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabies go on and on
They never die
That's how you and I will be","Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)",1997
Billy Joel,"Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, Sonny, move out to the country
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack (ack)
You oughta know by now (oughta know)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that what you get with your money

It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
He's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac

And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out

You should never argue with a crazy mind (mmm)
You oughta know by now

Billy Joel,"Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong
Don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

Billy Joel,"Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind

I've seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockys under the evergreens
I know what I'm needin'
And I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind

It was so easy livin' day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
Oh yeah

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues

Billy Joel,"I'm young enough to see the passionate boy that I used to be
But I'm old enough to say I got a good look at the other side
I know we got to work real hard, maybe even for the rest of our lives
But right now I just want to take what I can get tonight

While the night is still young
I want to keep making love to you
While the night is still young

I'd like to settle down
Gettin' married and maybe have a child someday
I can see a time coming when I'm gonna throw my suitcase out
No more separations
Where you have to say goodnight to a telephone
Baby I've decided that ain't what this life is all about
Oh

While the night is still young
While I keep making love to you
While the night is still young
I want to try to make the world brand new
While the night is still young

Rock and Roll music was the only thing I
Ever gave a damn about
There was something that was missing
But I never used to wonder why
Now I know you're the one
Who's gonna make things right again
And I may lose the battle
But you're giving me the will to try
Oh

While the night is still young
Because the night is still young
I've got a lot of catching up I've got to do

You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw but sooner or later it comes down to faith
Oh I might as well be the one

Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aw, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aw but that never hurt no one

So come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal and I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never let's in the sun
Darlin' only the good die young
Woah
I tell ya
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
(Oh woah woah)

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
I tell ya
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Well your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
Aw she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me? oh woah woah

Billy Joel,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In a hot new rent a car
He joins the lover in his heavy machine

And his style is so right for troubadours

Moving on is a chance that you take every time
You try to stay together
Say a word out of line and you find

Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes

Billy Joel,"A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of rose instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian Restaurant

Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight I did not know
You could ever look so nice after
So much time

Do you remember those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights

Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom
Riding around with the car top
Down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the
Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more
Than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would
Always know how to survive

Brenda and Eddy were still going
Steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would
Be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that
Kind of life
But there we were wavin' Brenda and
Eddie goodbye

They got an apartment with deep
Pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought
With the bread
They had saved for a couple
Of years
They started to fight when the
Money got tight
And they just didn't count on
The tears.

They lived for a while in a
Very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter
Of course
And they parted the closest
Of friends
Then the king and the queen went
Back to the green
But you can never go back
There again

Brenda and Eddie had had it
Already by the summer of '75
From the high  to the low to
The end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to
The greasers
The best they could do was
Pick up the pieces
We always knew they would both
Find a way to get by
That's all I heard about
Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I
Told you already
And here we are wavin' Brenda
And Eddie goodbye

I'll meet you anytime you want

Billy Joel,"Well I'm shameless when it comes to loving you
I'd do anything you want me to
I'd do anything at all

And I'm standing here for all the world to see
There ain't that much left of me
That has very far to fall

You know I'm not a man who has ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless, baby I don't have a prayer
Anytime I see you standing there
I go down upon my knees

And I'm changing, I swore I'd never compromise
But you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you please

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you

I have never let anything have this much 
Control over me
Cause I worked too hard to call my life my own
Yes I made myself a world 
And it worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse
I never had so much to lose
I'm shameless, shameless

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I ever missed
But I've never been in love like this

It's out of my hands

I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
But I don't want it anyhow
So I've got to let it go

I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You can make a total fool of me
I just wanted you to know

I am shameless
Shameless
Shameless",Shameless,1997
Billy Joel,"She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free

Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be

Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me",She's Always a Woman,1997
Billy Joel,"Well, we all have a face
That we hide away forever
And we take them out
And show ourselves when everyone has gone
Some are satin, some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
They're the faces of a stranger
But we'd love to try them on

Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes

Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

You may never understand
How the stranger is inspired
But he isn't always evil
And he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
You'll give in to your desire
When the stranger comes along",The Stranger,1997
Billy Joel,"Listen boy
I don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away

You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made

She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control

You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul

You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly

When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there

Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

'Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes

Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait, you got to
Tell her about it",Tell Her About It,1997

But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I
And those will be the days you can never recall

And so we embrace again

On winter afternoons
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun
I'm warm from the memory of days to come

Billy Joel,"Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right

Billy Joel,"You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
It's alright
It's alright
Sometimes that's what it takes
You're only human
You're allowed to make your share of mistakes
You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school
Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or' later you'll get your second wind

It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
It's alright
It's alright
Though you feel your heart break
You're only human
You're gonna have to deal with heartache
Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own
Don't forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in
You've been keeping to yourself these days
'Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
Till that old second wind comes along

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
It's alright
It's alright
Sometimes that's all it takes
We're only human
We're supposed to make mistakes
But I survived all those long lonely days
When it seemed I did not have a friend
'Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again
Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in
Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in",You're Only Human (Second Wind),1997
Billy Joel,"Everybody's got a million questions
Everybody wants to know the score
What you went through
It's something you
Should be over now

Everybody wants to hear the secrets
That you never told a soul before
And it's not that strange
Because it wouldn't change
What happened anyhow

But you swore to yourself a long time ago
There were some things that people never needed to know
Guess there's one that you keep
That you bury so deep
No one can tear it out

And you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

And you can't talk about it
And isn't that a kind of madness
To be living by a code of silence
When you've really got a lot to say

You don't want to lose a friendship
There's nothing that you have to hide
And a little dirt
Couldn't hurt no one anyway

And you still have a rage inside you
That you carry with a certain pride
In the only part of the broken heart
That you could ever save

But you've been through it once
You know how it ends
You don't see the point
Of going through it again
And this ain't the place
And this ain't the time
And neither's any other day

So you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

So you can't talk about it
And isn't that a kind of madness
To be living by a code of silence
When you've really got a lot to say

I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break
Some things unknown are best left alone forever
And if a vow is what it takes
Haven't you paid for your mistakes

After the moment passes
And the impulse disappears
You can still hold back
Because you don't crack very easily

It's a time honored resolution
Because the danger is always near
It's with you now
But that ain't how it was supposed to be

And it's hard to believe after all these years
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears
And you feel like a fool
Because it's part of your rules
You've got a memory

But you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

But you can't talk about it
And isn't that a kind of madness
To be living by a code of silence

Billy Joel,"I went searching for the truth
But in my innocence I found
All the con men and their acrobats
Who stomped me in the ground
If I count up their percentages
I know they're getting rich
But they haven't taken everything
Those paybacks are a bitch

Though I've lost quite a lot
I am still in control
They can keep what they've got
But they can't have my soul
And if I don't have this all worked out
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer
I still have far to go no doubt
But I'm getting closer, getting closer

What was ripped off by professionals
Is not all that it seems
While I must live up to contracts
I did not give up my dreams
If I see it as experience
It hasn't gone to waste
Lately all the missing pieces
Have been falling into place

And if I could go back and start over somehow
I would not change that much
Knowing what I know now
Thought there have been sins
I will regret
Still I'm getting close, getting closer
I don't have all the answers yet
But I'm getting closer, getting closer

I'm a mark for every shyster
From Topanga to Berlin
And I should have learned to kick them out
As soon as they crawled in
So to every bank in Switzerland
That stores my stolen youth
I'm alright because despite the laws
You cannot hide the truth

And although you will say
I am still too naive
But I have not lost faith
In the things I believe

And if I don't have a this all worked out
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer
I still have far to go no doubt
But I'm still getting closer, getting closer

Billy Joel,"Laura
Calls me
In the middle of the night
Passes on her
Painful information
Then these careless fingers
They get caught in her vice
Til they're bleeding
On my coffee table
Living alone isn't all that
It's cracked up to be
I'm on her side
Why does she push the poison on me?
Laura
Has a very hard time
All her life has
Been one long disaster
Then she tells me
She suddenly believes she's seen
A very good sign
She'll be taking
Some aggressive action
I fight her wars
While she's slamming her doors
In my face
Failure to break
Was the only mistake
That she made
Here I am
Feeling like a fucking fool
Do I react the way exactly
She intends me to?
Everytime I think I'm off the hook
She makes me lose my cool
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura
Calls me
When she needs a good fix
All her questions
Will get sympathetic answers
I should
Be so
Immunized
To all of her tricks
She's surviving
On her second chances
Sometimes I feel like this
Godfather deal is all wrong
How can she hold an umbilical chord
For so long?
I've done everything I can
What else am I supposed to do
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura
Loves me
Even if I don't care
That's my problem
That's her sacred absolution
If she had to
She would put herself in my chair
Even though I
Faced electrocution
She always says
I'm the best friend that
She's ever had
How do you
Hang up on someone
Who needs you that bad?

",A Room of Our Own,1998
Billy Joel,"There's a lot of tension in this town
I know it's building up inside of me
I've got all the symptoms and the side effects
Of city life anxiety

I could never understand why the urban attitude
Is so superior
In a world of high rise ambition
Most people's motives are ulterior

Sometimes I feel as though I'm running on ice
Paying the price too long
Kind of get the feeling that I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong

I'm a cosmopolitan sophisticate
Of culture and intelligence
The culmination of technology
And civilized experience

But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk
A modern man accumulates
I'm a statistic in a system
That a civil servant dominates

And all that means is that I'm running on ice
Caught in the vise so strong
I'm slipping and sliding, cause I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong

You've got to run
You've got to run

As fast as I can climb
A new disaster every time I turn around
As soon as I get one fire put out
There's another building burning down

They say this highway's going my way
But I don't know where it's taking me
It's a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race
It's breaking me

I get no traction cause I'm running on ice
It's taking me twice as long
I get a bad reaction cause I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong

You've got to run
You've got to run

Running on ice
Running on ice

Billy Joel,"The sins of Amsterdam
Were still a recent surprise
And we were flying over
Scandinavian Skies
We climbed towards the sun
We turned and cursed as one
We pulled the shades
And closed our eyes
The Stockholm city lights
Were slowly starting to rise
And we were strapped against
Those Scandinavian skies
The landing gear came down
And touched the Swedish ground
And we were all so paralyzed
On the plane
We were mainly sound and lights
In the veins
We could play the blues all night
The tour of Germany
Was bleeding into our eyes
And we were sailing over
Scandinavian skies
We had the Midas touch
Until we met the Dutch
And they exhausted our supplies
Who's to pay?
For this international flight
Who could stay
We were only there for the night
We watched the power fall
Inside the Olso hall
While all the cold Norweigians cried
Who could say
What was left and where was right?
By the way
I could play the blues all night


",Scandinavian Skies,1998
Billy Joel,"Turn on all the Christmas lights
Cause baby's coming home tonight
I can hear her footsteps in the street
Turn the choral music higher
Pile more wood upon the fire
That should make the atmosphere complete
I've had to wait forever
But better late than never
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
I'm a man with so much tension
Far too many sins to mention
She don't have to take it anymore
But since she said she's coming home
I've torn out all my telephones
Soon she will be walking through that door
I may be going nowhere
But I don't mind if she's there
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
Left to my own device
I can always make believe
That there's nothing wrong
Still I will chose to live
In the complicated world
That we shared for so long
Good or bad
Right or wrong
And it occurred to me
While I set up my Christmas tree
She never missed a cue
Or lost a beat
Everytime I lost the meter
There she was when I would need her
Greeting me with footsteps in the street
I guess I should have known it
She'd find the perfect moment
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
Turn the choral music higher
Pile more wood upon the fire

You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl",Uptown Girl (Disc 02),2001
Billy Joel,"You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
It's alright, it's alright
Sometimes that's what it takes
You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from you accidents
Than anything you could ever learn at school

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
It's alright, it's alright

Though you feel your heart break
You're only human, your gonna have to deal with heartache
Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only things that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in your corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
Till that old second wind comes along

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
It's alright, it's alright
Sometimes that's all it takes
We're only human
We're supposed to make mistakes
But I survived all those long lonely days
When it seemed I did not have a friend
Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could",You're Only Human (Second Time),2001
Billy Joel,"I have a feeling that's been goin on in your country right now is very much like the 60s. [Another man speaks Russian.] This song has been going around and around and my head since I've been here. [Another man speaks Russian.] This is called The Times They Are A-Changing. [Another man speaks Russian.]


Come gather 'round people wherever that you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
& accept it that soon U'll be drenched to the bone if your time to you is worth savin' 
Then U better start swimmin' or U'll sink like a stone 4 the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophecise with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheels still in spin
And there's no tellin' now that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win for the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers & fathers throughout land & don't criticize what U can't understand
Your sons & your daughters R beyond your command your old road is rapidly agein'
So get out of the new one if U can't lend your hand 4 the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast, the slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last for the times they are a-changin'",The Times They Are A-Changin',2002

I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way of talkin'
I don't know what it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel

And I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a light around her
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing, the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road

Billy Joel,"Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line

Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers in the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow

And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay
Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave

If we worked hard
If we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coal

And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away
Every child has a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our place

Billy Joel,"Once long ago, all the faithful held a show
Down in Elvis Presley Blvd. on Memphis Radio
Where the hopeless held a vigil and the nameless played the charts
Where the losers lost their sorrow and the lonely left their hearts

Step on these shoes then I'll see you in hell
""Love me so tender,"" I cried
Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die

I took a ride with my baby by my side
And the Elvis Presley Blvd. where all the faithful cried
And I saw that silent mansion and I knew that I was lost
They were selling plastic souvenirs of Elvis on the cross

Step on these shoes and I'll see you in hell
""Love me so tender,"" I cried
Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die

Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on

Man I was beat, I was driven by the heat
Down to Elvis Presley Blvd. in a one-way dead end street
And I smashed my car to pieces and I said goodbye to youth
I had all the ugly rumors and I could not face the truth

She don't mind makin' love every night

""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise a miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
You best bet's a true baby-blue Continental""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel, baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers""
Next phase, new wave , dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that their out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
""If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money""

Billy Joel,"Victor was born 
The spring of 44 
And never saw 
His father anymore 
The child of sacrifice 
Child of war 
Another son who never had 
A father after Leningrad 
Went off to school 
And learned to serve his state 
Follow the rules 
And drank his vodka straight 
The only way to live 
Was drown the hate 
The Russian life was very sad 
And such was life in Leningrad 

I was born in 49 
A cold war kid in the McCarthy times
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel 
Blast those yellow reds to hell 
Cold war kids were hard to kill 
Under their desks in an air raid drill 
Haven't they heard we won the war 
What do they keep on fighting for? 

Victor was sent 
To some red army town 
Served out his time 
Become a circus clown 
The greatest happiness 
He'd ever found 
Was making Russian children glad 
When children lived in leningrad. 

The children lived in Levittown 
Hid in the shelters underground 
Til the soviets turned their ships around 
Torn the Cuban missiles down 
And in that bright October sun 
We knew our childhood days were done 
I watched my friends go off to war 
What do they keep on fighting for? 

So my child and I came to this place 
To meet him , eye to eye and face to face 
He made my daughter laugh 
Then we embraced 
We never knew what friends we had 
Until we came to Leningrad.",Leningrad [DVD][Live],2005

There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

As the businessmen slowly get stoned

But it's better than drinkin' alone

And the microphone smells like a beer

I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs
And left there long ago 

They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
But we went right on with the show 

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on Forty second street 

They burned the churches up in Harlem
Like in that Spanish civil war
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
It always burned up there before 

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the Battery
The union went on strike
They never sailed at all 

They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
And blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea

Billy Joel,"Even though I'm in love
Sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong
Just to have something to say

I know the moment isn't right
To tell the girl a comical line
To keep the conversation light
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind

But if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

Yes I know I'm in love
But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth
Cause I'm just avoiding the facts

If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide

And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone
You've got to leave a tender moment

You know what I mean,
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.
So how could I dance with another (ooh)

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway nine, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire 
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

One, two, three, four!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
But there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
And we'll walk in the sun

But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Will never stand the strain

They set you on the treadmill

And pain was the price you paid

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone

There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep

I know there's fish out there but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I've got people back on land who count on me

And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa

And there's no luck in swordfishing here

In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid 
And his age and his size 
Took the teller by surprise 
And, the word spread of Billy  the kid 

Well he never traveled heavy 
Yes he always rode alone 
And he soon put many older guns to shame 
And he never had a sweetheart 
And he never had a home 
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name 

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma 
And the largest could not seem to track him down 
And it served his legend well 
For the folks they loved to tell about 
When Billy the kid came to town. 

Well one cold day a posse captured Billy 
And the judge said String him up for what he did.

Like the sea, came pouring in 
To watch the hanging of Billy the kid.

Under the boot hill grave that bears his name.

And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights

Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom
Riding around with the car top
Down and the radio on.
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the
Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more
Than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would
Always know how to survive.

Brenda and Eddy were still going
Steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would
Be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
""Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that
Kind of life.""
But there we were wavin' Brenda and
Eddie goodbye.

They got an apartment with deep
Pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought
With the bread
They had saved for a couple
Of years
They started to fight when the
Money got tight
And they just didn't count on
The tears.

They lived for a while in a
Very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter
Of course
And they parted the closest
Of friends
Then the king and the queen went
Back to the green
But you can never go back
There again.

Brenda and Eddie had had it
Already by the summer of '75
From the high  to the low to
The end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to
The greasers
The best they could do was
Pick up the pieces
We always knew they would both
Find a way to get by
That's all I heard about
Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I
Told you already
And here we are wavin' Brenda
And Eddie goodbye.

Billy Joel,"She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free

Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden 
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be

Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you 
But she's always a woman to me",She's Always a Woman [#],2014
Billy Joel,"Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light 
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for

Billy Joel,"If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know

When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me where else can I turn
'Cause you're the one I depend upon

Billy Joel,"Some people stay far away from the door 
If there's a chance of it opening up 
They hear a voice in the hall outside 
And hope that it just passes by 

Some people live with the fear of a touch 
And the anger of having been a fool 
They will not listen to anyone 
So nobody tells them a lie 

I know you're only protecting yourself 
I know you're thinking of somebody else 
Someone who hurt you 
But I'm not above 
Making up for the love 
You've been denying you could ever feel 
I'm not above doing anything 
To restore your faith if I can 
Some people see through the eyes of the old 
Before they ever get a look at the young 
I'm only willing to hear you cry 
Because I am an innocent man 
I am an innocent man 
Oh yes I am 

Some people say they will never believe 
Another promise they hear in the dark 
Because they only remember too well 
They heard somebody tell them before 

Some people sleep all alone every night 
Instead of taking a lover to bed 
Some people find that it's easier to hate 
Than to wait anymore 

I know you don't want to hear what I say 
I know you're gonna keep turning away 
But I've been there and if I can survive 
I can keep you alive 
I'm not above going through it again 
I've not above being cool for a while 
If you're cruel to me I'll understand 

Some people run from a possible fight 
Some people figure they can never win 
And although this is a fight I can lose 
The accused is an innocent man 
I am an innocent man 
Oh yes I am 
An innocent man 

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite 
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight 
That's your decision 
But I'm not below 
Anybody I know 
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love 
I'm not above going back to the start 
To find out where the heartache began 

Some people hope for a miracle cure 
Some people just accept the world as it is 
But I'm not willing to lay down and die 
Because I am an innocent man 

I am an innocent man 
Oh yes I am

Billy Joel,"Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time",The Longest Time [#],2014

Billy Johnson,"Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark.
Just like a child, who, late from school walks bravely home through the park.
To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay.
Neither quite knowing which way they are going, they sing the shadows away,
Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good.
And then I see a brand new face, I glimpse some new neighborhood.
So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true.
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you.
