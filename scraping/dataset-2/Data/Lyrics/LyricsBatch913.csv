Red Hot 'N' Blue,"I couldn't live without my cellphone,
I couldn't live without my four x four,
I couldn't live without my credit card,
I couldn't live without you. 

Funny how the little things 
We can't do without,
Make you wonder somehow
How we did it before.
When I found love,
Never knew that I needed love,
Now I can't get enough of 
Wanting it more and more.

And I spend most my days,
Finding different ways,
Thinking how to say,
Just how much I love you.

I couldn't live without my cellphone,
I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,
I couldn't live without my credit card,
And I wonder what I did before,
Like your love babe,
If you ever take it all away,
I wouldn't make it through another day,
I couldn't live without you.

No I can't conceive,
Going back to how it used to be,
You've affected my reality,
And I need you like the air I breathe.
I can't go back,
Don't you know you hooked me up like that,
It'll hit me a heart attack,
If you ever should leave.

Spending most my nights
Lost inside your eyes,
Wondering how can I
Ever live without you,
Live without you beside my side.",Without You,2002
Red Hot Big Band,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee

Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones

But let me tell you little boy
You better leave her alone
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou

She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, get down!

That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box

But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock
A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat

Red Hot Chili Peppers,"About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?
Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?",Green Heaven,

Along with six million others in this place called L.A.
L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump

Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone
Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Freak out!
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playin', you better be burning Sherman!

On a far away island of Salamasond
I said, Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean, it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
""I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me""

With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Gave a command
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
Oh, Yertle the turtle
""The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow 
I'm king of a mule""

Look at the turtle go, bro!

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said, ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty?""
""Silence!"" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'

I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, 
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, 
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, 
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide,

I want anything that I can have, 
But I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, 
But I'll be okay, 'cause I don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, 
You know it gives to share

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I wonder why, why
Put us in your pumpkin shell
Where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell

When history books are full of shit
I become the anarchist, I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie, no place for me, I bleed

Crashing through the dark

To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
Be wrong, thats wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, forefathers, help me decide

A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides

Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when

And slipped through whatever cracks we can find minds altered 
We didn't falter in portraying hysterical and tragic characters
In a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city 
And the journeys away from it 
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spiral 
Leaving trail of irretrievable vital life juice behind
Still the brothers blood comrades partner family cuzz was impenetrable
And we lived inside it laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental 'till death was upon us 
In our face mortality and lots of things seemed futile then 
But love and music can save us and did
While the giant grey monster grew more poisoned and volatile around us

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't

Knocked out but boy you better come to

Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers

The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

I guess, I'll learn to take
The good with the bad

I'll be a lonely one

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

A sign from the Gods that you were meant to be mine

Far away, but we both know it's somewhere

I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday
The drift wood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pain
I know you from another picture

Fooled around and pulled some capers

All the way, time to come and find you
But you can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do

Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I bet my sovereign country and I left it all for your head

You were getting married and it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
And now I guess it's me who's bumming

You and I were mixing tears
Not today, not for me but someone
I never could get used to, so now I will refuse to

Pull out a condom, so she don't complain that ""I'm late""
I'll be your ""Almond Joy"" if you feel like a nut

And down and up and down, with sound

So come kiss the mister, it's the drifter
Who licks ya from your ass to your toe-jam, sister
When I'm erectness, check this
Let me cum on your neck and make a pearl sperm necklace
I'll lick your body if it's ashy, I'm nasty, ain't nothing to it

I'm livin to destroy Mikes like Robin Givens
But it's a given that I'm the absolute best since

Seen your movie, gee, you didn't represent

My Method will 'bring the pain' simply cause I'm the man
So be a fan and let the are-e-d expand over band

Hey ladies, can't you see I'm best at my sport and
Those rap styles you like got more Airs [/errors] than Jordan

They hate the jive flow like young blacks hate the five-o
So creep to my TLC if you're yearnin
I want to fuck Left Eye but I heard she's burnin..
I'm earnin mad chips to keep my pockets thick
While yours are anorexic like that [edited] chick

? gotta have the beast in his belly
More ? than skelly, more Thunder than Shelly
Pick up the telly and tell and friend and tell a friend
Red Hot's got niggas on their bended knees like Boyz II Men
You can't defend if you wind up on my stress list
Bet this, High School SAT's couldn't test this
I'm leavin wack MC's holy for Heaven
Kiss this sweet Earth good-bye, you're booty like Tevin

With their ornamental stars

Until now I thought I figured your body out
So please help me to understand
Because I love you more than anyone

You're chasing dragonflies at play
My little lost girl so far away

Darkness tones in our Chinatown home

View of rain clouds from the window
Moving behind the pale of her face
A thousand circus mirrors cannot move a frown

And the sun rarely shines our way
And when it does, and when it does
And when it does, and when it does
And when it does

There with you I fear the time, when air gets dark
You know I don't spend days like this
Caught up in lost times of youth that I miss

Can almost hear roller coasters, see sailboats in the sea
Hear noise and screaming
Weaving in and out of happy music box sounds
But here on the ground we're so far away from that
Time turned older now

We walked down the hill, I feel the coming on of the fading sun
And I know for sure that you'll never be the one
It's the forbidden moment that we live that fires our sad escape
And holds passion more than words can say

Tell me why are you like this? Are you the same with anyone?
Save me from my sickness and tell me why do you treat me like this?

Liquid canyon far beneath, my mother savior
With her goddess touch brushes hands through my hair

Who else's hands have touched
Who I best understand
Held close the neck and waist
Of my adult orphan

Life under China dinner din
Wishes best to mystery address
I found deep in your occult key chest

On my suicide cloud
Left me in the pit of my morning pout

With acres and a farm and a stream to cleanse me
Your house with a view of purity
Overlooks a hillside of green, green as your eyes

And toy with ideas that burn deep inside me
?Cause a picture is all you are to me

Red House Painters,"Going past golden gate
Elementary everyday
Kids down colorful hill
Recess and fire drill
She likes the side without the heat
Where the sun don't beat
She likes the cooler side
Of Washington street

Hummingbirds, pigeons and doves
Hover rooftops above
Light shine down into the tides
Over hillsides
See where the bridge and mountian meet
At the mouth of the sea
And where the sailboats live a day
And turn away
With the purple evening

Losing our loving hold
In the skies flourescent glow
She takes her thoughts and cares
Into the moonlit alley stairs
Still in my hand I feel the sting
The sound of bells ring
And the memory of the face
Never washes away
The current evening
",Priest Alley Song,1996
Red House Painters,"You'd think that people would've had enough
Of silly love songs
I look around and I see
It isn't so
Some people want to fill the world
With silly love songs

What's wrong with that?
Ohhhh, how I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Now can you see
She gave me more
She gave love to me

What's wrong with that?
Ohhhh, how I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again

How can I tell you about
My love one
How can I tell you about
My love one
How can I tell you about
My love one
Hooooowwwww can I tell you

How can I tell you, you
Hooooowwwww can I tell you

",Silly Love Songs,1996
Red House Painters,"When everything we felt fails
Then some music, soft and distant sails
But it don't sound like it did before
Then I know I'm left with nothing more
Then my own soul

When pretty pictures face back
But your coats aren't hanging on the rack
And blue water turns to
A place that I can't get to
A place that I can't

In a room all I feel
Is the cold that you left

Through the air all I see
Is your face full of blame

What's left to see?
What's there to see?

In the room all I feel
Is the cold that you left

Through the air all I see
Is your face full of blame

What's left to see?
What's left to see?
What's left to see?
What's left to see?
",Song for a Blue Guitar,1996
Red House Painters,"How have you been Caroline?
Living okay? Home in PA
See how the color left from our faces
From when, when we were younger

Just yesterday I was making the reach
Went for a swim in lover's beach
And there I met friends and I neared the bay
Until I felt sick

But you were my friend
Don't you know how I needed you then
I felt nervous when you shook and cried
The circles under your eyes
Made love till you reached the clouds
Through the ceilings and walls that surround

One time you drove through heat and hard rain
Three hundred miles in the roots of your pain
Things get so far back in your mind
That we don't connect

But you were my friend
At the turn of my life's events
I felt weak in the hold of your soul
And your blood-red eyes even more
But the feelings that stay with you now
Get lost over time somehow
",Trailways,1996
Red House Painters,"In the night we freeze
And you want me to tell
In London's lonesome park
Brockwell

Out here, I am distracted
As fire bombs explode
Bonfire lamps glow
To the crowded road

If the days weren't so precious
And no worlds where shorted wires had kept us
Things would be better than this
There's an angel by the ocean, I miss

And trips on the train
Before our lives changed
The mirror I watched
Your naked body strain
",Brockwell Park [4 Track Demo],1999
Red House Painters,"So much that I can't say to you
My voice shakes from the hurt that I hide
Ashamed of my existence
And of my petty often wounded pride

I'd like to come home to see you
And to catch your sickness by the bedside
But then you'd know how much I really need you

All the love in an instant
Makes my life stop
But then my hate for you
Makes my feelings altogether drop

If only I were blind to your selfish fling
And your desperate cause
And didn't press you for the details
That threaten my physical flaws

I'd like to come home to see you
And embrace your illness under soft light
But then you'd know how much I really need you

All the love in an instant
Makes my life stop
But then my hate for you
Makes my feelings altogether drop

So much that I can say to you
With affection that I burn inside
You're aching from the distance
Avoiding strain that's running still alive

If only I could heal you
In the sprinkling of the ocean side
But then you'd know how much I really love you

All the love in an instant
Makes my life stop
But then my hate for you
Makes my feelings altogether drop
",Drop,1999
Red House Painters,"Giving into love and sharing my time
Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step by step
How I landed on the island
And how I swam across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may wake to a knife in me
No more breath in my hair
Or ladies' underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed
To a neatly written poem
A heartfelt last line reading
There is no more mystery
It it going to happen my love

It's all in your head she said
Morning after nightmare
You're building a wall she said
Higher than the both of us
So try living life
Instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile
And I'll promise not to leave you

It happened under a rainy cloud
Passing through the dark south
We went into a big house
And slept in a small bed
I didn't know you then
As well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives
And we went off separately
I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards
And some long forgotten high school fears
It's all in my head I said
Banging a piano
I've not been so alone I thought
Since kicking in the womb
I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked
Pretending you were with me
Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends
Like birthdays and old friends
We forget what is flesh blood and bone is human
Turning phone lines to airlines
Unwilling to face
The love is found on the inside not the outside
And like a medicine bottle
In the cabinet I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you
And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose
The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom
It's all in my head she read
In her girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself
Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries
He shuts out the world
And wants only to love you

Not wanting to die out here
Without you",Medicine Bottle,1999
Red House Painters,"Michael, where are you now?

Somehow in my excitement the last time you called,
It slipped again to ask your hidden whereabouts
I got a lead from your old triple ex-girlfriend, she said
""I heard he lost his mind again""
""Again?"" I said
I didn't know that you ever did

Michael, where are you now?

Sleeping through the morning in flannel impaired
Getting high in southern air
Shoeless, sandy eveing down the unfamiliar
Last whiff of salt-water freedom
Skipping shells in the dead zone
With the ghost on your side
Of the state borderline
Whispering
""Take it.""

Do you remember our first subway ride?
Our first heavy metal haircuts?
Our last swim on the east coast?
And me with my ridiculous looking pierced nose?

Left the mother of three sons

Red House Painters,"Some odd door, some blooming tree
Senseless and awkward feeling hard uneased
Sleep in rooms where people leave
Dry of gentleness of life of breeze

Sometimes you get so alone
Without a friend
It's hard to know who you are?
And to pretend

Little lights reaching over my head
Shiny sinks to let myself out in
And you won't call to say that it's all right
'Cause you know it lasts all night

You know you should be at home
Where it's good to be tired
Under a roof that you know
That we're inside

Faded pictures gathered 'round me still
And I know what you face in the night
And I know you'll be alright

Red House Painters,"Meet me in Leon near Mexico City
Where I remember you clear
Meet me at night, St. Louis, Missouri
Where I first saw you

There is a scent that linger around me
Find me wherever I go
There are the pictures sad but so pretty
Lakes and sunsets

Find me asleep near deserts and oceans
Places I couldn't have dreamt
They are all cold and frozen without you
They are nothing

Chase me down Sycamore
Kije you did not long before
Play you old brown guitar
And shine so bright

There is a trail that winds around the river
There is a bench on the ground
Those are the beds in the rooms that we slept in
Those are the songs we found

Find me in streets searching for something
Something somehow that I lost
Find me in life faking for someone
Someone as good

Look for me like you did
On the days I ran and hid
Bring your old gifts you brung
And find me here

There is a world big as a mountain
There is a world to be shared
Still there is love tall as a mountain
Still there is love

Red House Painters,"Hanging low a big embrace of Aztec moon
You throwing down a glow on this fluorescent tune
And cooling off and phasing out of chlorine bed
Shadows at the walls of the sun makes clear the door he read

Void of movement, void of feeling, void of life
Shadows crackles Spanish churchs in the night
Don't feel sour in the far window there
Don't be bothered by the words in your head

When the sun goes down and just a night
This will bring up pretty, some old fly
And make what's dead come alive
For the long and lonely ride

Ancient highways, desert dust, diamond lit sky
Like some lost planet, never breathes any life
And barely moving, broken ears bend and crawl
Talk to where you're stuck in and I won't cease until dawn

Wake me up when you can hear
The sound of people getting near
Where what's dead come alive
And there's a long and lonely ride

Who can know there's so much life around us thins?
Life from heaven smiles down on this room
Some parade of colors, marching on music trails
Morning slips to evening, falls through holes in between days

And you can lose another year
Where are the pictures perfect teen?
And where what's dead come alive
And where you are comes alive

Red House Painters,"My baby sleeps in blue
Warm and naked, pale and pretty
I feel the seventh wave
Of the ocean in the motion

I feel a brand new sickness
Coming over me like a storm
Used to feel so good beside her
There next to her my arm around her

She fell like flowers
Petals were carried out on my old wind
Landed down in the center
Of this lonely white grip of winter

She brought these gifts of love
I carried down in my pocket
I set them on my shelves
And on the nightstand by my bed

She sleeps and won't come back again
From pretty dreams that keep her
My baby won't come back again
I feel so lost without her

I hear your magic voice
On the analogue of this machine
I hear the smoothest talk
With the coolest transparent star field

Will there be any danger
If our talk is under this roof?
And can you know a stranger
So quickly under this moon?

So go away, come back again
I'll shut you out, I'll pull you in
Don't go away, come back again
I feel so lost

She sleeps in royal blue
And room down past the big dry desert
The sense of music there
And hope reaches you

And gets you past the motions
Of goodbyes [Incomprehensible]
And pulls the deepest winter
Out of this lonely white crippled winter

She sleeps and won't come back again
From pretty dreams that keep her
My baby won't come back again
I am so lost without her

So go away, come back again
I shut you out, I pull you in
Don't go away, come back again

You came out here five years ago
Her life song is a sad one
Her mom fell off when she was young
Her mom died off when she was young

Purple nights and yellow days
Neon signs and silver lakes
LA took a part of me
LA gave this gift to me

So, drive me down Sunset Boulevard
I'm feeling nice in your white car
Playing Hanoi Rocks and Social D
My sweetest angel set me free
My sweetest savior rescued me

Won't you whisper in my ear?
You look so good against my mirror
And you're my baby full of joy
You're my erotic brown eyed toy
You're my exotic black haired toy

Slipping letters under the door
Leave candy wrappers round my floor
And take me out of here round the canyons
Where the pavement meets the sand
Where the boardwalk creatures stand

So, drive down Beverly Drive
Where my room's lit up all night
I've been so lonely in this bed
It's good to sleep with you instead
It's good to talk all night instead

Morning pours the ocean deep
Into the hollow of my sleep
But the ocean can't be mine
Your perfection can't be mine

So, drive me down the 405
Where my airplane leaves tonight
I'm tipping up and touching down
Leave LA sparkling on the ground

Red Mitchell,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

Red Mitchell,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2006
Red Mitchell,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2006

Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

Red Norvo,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots

Remain to love until they droop and die

A song in blue
Like a flower crying

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

My love is a prelude that never dies

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,

I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Red Norvo Trio,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca

With my battalion, lyrical stallion, riding
Dividing the sheep from the golden lyrical quote

Yo, my war's against the foundation
Of a global united nation
When humans rule the world
By the codes of free mason
Hallucinated, by the quest for domination
An equation, which equals the battle station
Ready to bust, capture and crush
Move a nine of us, stealth style rebellious
Prefer profile, cause the beast is hideous
So move agile, seek the facts and compile
More wisdom, smokin' isms
That your knowledge and your children
Give thanks and it has nothin' to do
With the f***in' Pilgrims
Startin' the curriculum, the Devil wants to be Ichiban

But by the locks of the dreaded don aka Red 1

So grab your Teflon, your muskets and your swords
And peace love and unity will be your reward

Red Rider,"I'd walk those streets
I'd walk those streets alone
And though it was a long way
A long way from home
I didn't know many faces
Some they look like stone
Some hungry jackals
Ragged to the bone
I'd go on believing
It was only a state of mind
Then my love would appear
She would shatter my bitter mind

The only game in town
You are the only game

I would look forward
To the times I love the best
Now I treat each moment
As if it was my last
You can't lock your love away
Or hide your heart like a fool
You've got to always be afraid
Of letting the pistons cool

The only game in town
You are the only game
The only game in town
You are the only game

I wrote you a letter
Now I've come around
I hope you feel better
Didn't mean to bring you down
Because there is no hidden treasure
There is no pot of gold
There is no rags to riches
Only the rugged soul

You are the only game.

Red Rider,"Knew he was a misfit
Since the age of seventeen

He had to do it his way they said
He should be quarantined 
He went looking to the East
He went looking to the West
He was looking for the courage
To see which way was the best.

Can't turn back
Oh no

Look out on his right
He would look out on his left
He would look out in the distance
Where he could see the wilderness
When the thunderhead approached
He would pull off to the side
And when the sun broke through
He would get back out and ride

'Cause you can't turn back...

Try to see the forest for the trees
The wind storm for the breeze
No one ever said that it would be that easy
You make your way through the debris
Cling to your beliefs
Even though the world might say your crazy

He always had the feeling
He would get back out alive
But the more that he sees of it
Then the less he fantasizes
Though he's lost a bit of freedom
He has traded it for love
Knows that he'd fight for it
If that push came to shove
