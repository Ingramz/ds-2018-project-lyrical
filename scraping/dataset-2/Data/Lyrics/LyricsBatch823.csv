Paul Chambers Quartet,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2014
Paul Chapman,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town 
 
Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town 
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
 
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town, hm
 
It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town,2005
Paul Clarkson,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day",Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!,2000
Paul Clarkson,"The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Are you the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all

Paul Clarkson,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end

Paul Clayton Orchestra,"There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Miserables],2001

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Fly, of course!
Fly!
It's easy! All you have to do is to is to is to

What's the matter?
Don't you know?
Oh sure, it's, it's just that I never thought about it before
Say, that's it! you think of a wonderful thought!

Uhuh
Like toys at Christmas? sleight bells? snow?
Yep! watch me nowhere I go!
It's easier than pie!

I'll think of a mermaid lagoon
Oh underneath a magic moon
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave
I'll think I'll be an Indian brave
Now, everybody try one, two, three!
We can fly! we can fly! we can fly!
This won't do what's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust oh!
And something I forgot Dust!
Dust? Dust?
Yep! Just a little bit of pixie dust

Now, think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Let's all try it, just once more
Look! we're rising off the floor
Jiminy! oh my! we can fly!
You can fly! we can fly!
Come on, everybody, here we go!
Off to Never Land!

Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells  off you go!
Like a reindeer in the sky
You can fly! you can fly! you can fly!

Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye
You can fly! you can fly! you can fly!

Up you go with a height and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true

Come on!

When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly! you can fly! you can fly! you can fly! you can fly!

There it is, Wendy, second star to the right

Although ?Turn? delivers a general message for the world, it is also directed towards the church.

Turn this life around
Turn this life around

Take a look around can you tell me
Why does it take a tragedy to bring us all together?
Who can change a heart change a motivation
Take it right back to the start?

Come and dream with me
That we were all together
In perfect unity following the maker

_______________________________
Although ?Turn? delivers a general message for the world, it is also directed towards the church. We are meant to be leaders in relationships, politics and art, yet we are often on the fringe rather than the cutting edge. This song challenges us to consider what we need to turn away from and what we should be turning to. We've got to turn this life around! Essentially that means always turning back to Jesus.",Turn [*],2003

That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again

And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1993
Paul de Leeuw,"Rood is al lang het rood niet meer
Het rood van rode rozen
De kleur van liefde van weleer
Lijkt door de haat gekozen

Dat mooie rood was ooit voor mij
Een kleur van passie en van wijn
Ik wil haar terug, die mooie tijd
Maar zij lijkt lang vervlogen

En alle beelden op TV
Van bloed en oorlog om ons heen
Werken daar ook niet echt aan mee

Dus ik neem heel bewust het besluit
De krant leg ik weg
En de TV gaat uit

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Ik loop de deur door en naar buiten waar de zon begint te schijnen
Laat alles achter, kijk vooruit en met mijn laatste rooie cent
Koop ik een veel te grote bos met hondervijftig rode rozen
Een voor elk jaar waarvan ik hoop dat jij nog bij me bent.

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

En nu sta je hier zo voor me
De rode avondzon streelt jouw gezicht
Je bent een wonder voor me
Denk ik, terwijl een doorn mijn vinger prikt

Rood is mijn bloed dat valt op de grond
En even lijk ik verloren
Maar jij brengt mijn vingers naar je mond
En je kust ze
En ik weet


Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Vandaag? is rood
Gooi de loper uit
En drink een goed glas wijn
Pluk de dag want het kan zo ineens de laatste zijn
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jouw en mij

Vandaag staat rood weer voor de liefde
Tussen jou en mij

De grote autowe.., eh.. moet ik praten?
Oh, ik dacht dat ik moest zingen
Hallo boppers

De grote autowegen slingeren zich over bergen en door valleien
Ik denk dat ik ze in de loop der jaren allemaal bereden heb
Omdat de cabine van mijn truck bijna 25 jaar lang mijn huis is geweest
Het zou voor mij vreemd zijn een geregeld leven te moeten leiden, tja
Tja, ik herinner me mij mijn eerste truck nog die ik bestuurde
Ik was zo trots als een pauw en popelde om hem aan mijn vrouw en mijn
zoontje te laten zien
Mijn jongen was net zo onder de indruk als toen hij voor het eerst ..
Als toen hij voor het eerst sneeuw zag
Hij kon nog maar net een paar woordjes zeggen en zijn vaste begroeting was
altijd
Giddy up go pappa, giddy up go
Daarom gaf ik mijn truck die naam, giddy up go
Een slecht leven was het niet ondanks het feit dat ik het altijd druk had
Het was... het was een jaar of zes erna toen ik op een dag thuis kwam
Maar d'are niemand wa.. 
Het was een jaar of zes erna toen ik op een dag thuis kwam en er niemand
was
Mijn vr.. mijn vrouw was met de kleine jongen vertrokken
Ik kon er niet achterkomen waarheen nie.. waarheen
Niemand wist het
Vanaf die dag was ik alleen met mijn oude giddy up go
In de vele koffietentjes langs de weg had ik in de loop van de tijd veel
vrienden gemaakt
Niemand plaagde mij met die bijzondere naam op mijn kar
Ik had ze over mijn knul verteld en wat zijn reactie was toen hij voor het
eerst mijn truck zag, giddy up go
Verleden week denderde ik weer over de weg toen ik op een gegeven moment
word ingehaald door een splinternieuwe dieseltruck

En hij breekt in bij een ouwe vrouw
Hij rooft de koelkast leeg slaat oma blauw, in de ghetto
En op een nacht barst het van de honger

Hij koopt een mes, steelt een kar, wordt ontdenkt en komt niet far

Van de liefde wist ik niets
En opeens riep zij: dag lieverd

En we reden langs de zee
En d'are haren waren blond
En ik vond het onbegrijpelijk mooi
Dat iemand mij een lieverd vond

Fietsten naar een rustig plekje
Met dat indrukwekkend kind
Naar een afgelegen stekje
Net een beetje uit de wind
En toen zei ze weer iets liefs

Just as if outta nowhere, and from that instant
Begin to be program', to decode eve—
Rything we see in a particular way
Now some have the nerve to venture off into the unknown
Some don't, they're content to watch from the front row
Either way it's still a game that can be cut-throat
You don't wanna be on the wrong end of all the gun smoke
But your destiny waits
So there's really no need for precaution, of course
We are cautious, it's all we know
Just one false move and it's all she wrote, that's what they tell us
So we all take aim to stake claim
And if you get there just pray you maintain
Long enough, not to suffer and
No longer have to sing a song for your supper
Let's pray

How long we gonna keep on sufferin'
And fallin' on our knees for nothin'?
I'm starting to believe in somethin'
It's kinda hard to hear it but it's callin' out

Because I look inside, find this insight
Guessin' in this life, people would think I
Must know really what mine's for
But the truth I'm not quite sure
All I'm doin' is tryna follow my heart
Even though that my head's sayin', 'what if I can't?'
What if my path is already planned out
I already see how the story will pan out
It's not gonna be, well shit still I'm not gonna stop
When a job is the only other option I got
I'm not sayin' that it's wrong 'cause it's not
But if you're workin' and it doesn't make you happy then what
Is the point? I mean really?
Either you can take a shot or try to merely make do
When you see that that's the only other move
Then there really isn't anything to lose, choose

How long we gonna keep on sufferin'
And fallin' on our knees for nothin'?
I'm starting to believe in somethin'

Hey that's the way everything goes
Some get what they want, the rest never get close
That's why they say if you ever get chosen
You made it 'cause anything goes
That's why we find ourself in a time where
People deny what's really inside them, frightened
Mighta feared that the outcome is doubtful
Not knowin' in itself that's the downfall, it's weird right
See we think we'll never make an impact
Since a young age we've been trained to think that
That's the only reason we're beaten
They know they can feed us this shit and we'll believe it, either
You can struggle through life or take your story
And then turn it into something you like it's all up in your mind
And in mine man, I'm leavin' on a plane
So if you're comin' there too well then I'll see you on the way

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,

A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

Paul Desmond,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams [Alternate Version],

I'll tell you no lie

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Paul Desmond,"What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears

Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sunset

Settle like dust
On the shoulders of the old friends

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be seventy

Silently sharing the same fear

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Paul Desmond,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love [*],2004

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Paul Di'Anno,"There is a sound from the kitchen
And it's a sound he's heard a thousand times before
When he hears his mother crying
He runs away and hides inside his room

But there is no escaping
The anger in his fathers voice
And when the tears are falling
He falls down to his knees and prays

Just hold me and love me
Touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

His little arms are black and blue
And there's a little cut right under his eye
Every night he lies awake
And from downstairs the fighting starts again

Have you forgot the reason
Why this little child was born?
Cause if you go on fighting
You'll destroy this family

Just hold him and love him
Touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

Stop fighting, stop hurting
Try to love again
And do your best to save this
Broken home

If you ever hold him tight
Let him feel your love again
You will make him smile again

Hold him, love him
And touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

Stop fighting, stop hurting
Try to love again
And do your best to save this

Paul Dillon,"Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy
That swept that afternoon
To paint that love
Upon a white balloon

And fly it from
The top-est top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something
Just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard
But the Captain shook his head

And away they soared
Climbing through
The ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party
The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party

The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party
The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party

The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party

We loved each other tenderly
Like we loved all lovers
Then when day you left me
Ever since I've been desperate
I see you everywhere in the sky
I see you everywhere on the earth
You are my joy and my sun
My nights, my days, my clear dawns

(CHORUS)

You are everywhere because you are in my heart
You are everywhere because you are my happiness
Everything that is around me
Even life does not represent you
Sometimes I dream that I am in your arms
And you speak softly in my ear
You tell me things that make me close my eyes
And I find that marvellous

Maybe one day you will return
I know that my heart waits for you
You can not forget
The past days we spent together
My eyes never stop searching for you
Listen well, my heart calls you
We can love each other again
And you'll see life would be beautiful

The snow is on the grass again,
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena,
The frost gleams where the flowers have been.
But my heart beats on as warmly now,
As when the summer days were nigh,
The sun can never dip so low,
Or down affections cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, Lorena,
Since last I held that hand in mine,
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena,
Though mine beat faster far than thine.
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may,
When up the hilly slope we climbed,
To watch the dying of the day,
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, Lorena,
More than we ever dared to tell,
And what we might have been, Lorena,
Had but our lovings prospered well.
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone,
I'll not call up their shadowy forms,
I'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on!
Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""

The story of that past, Lorena,
Alas! I care not to repeat,
The hopes that could not last, Lorena,
They lived, but only lived to cheat.
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now,
For ""if we try, we may forget,""
Were words of thine long years ago.

Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena,
They burn within my memory yet,
They touched some tender chords, Lorena,
Which thrill and tremble with regret.
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke,
Thy heart was always true to me:
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

It matters little now, Lorena,
The past is in the eternal past,
Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena,
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast.
There is a future! o, thank god!
Of life this is so small a part!
'tis dust to dust beneath the sod,
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart.",Lorena,1999

You talk of liberty

Come up and feel the sun

Why not stay and be caught?

Who you were when you know
That you're not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if you are
What a prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which you don't?

So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where every thing's wrong?
Or where every thing's right
And you know that you'll never belong?

Do it quick

It's your first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary

And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
You'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose

So you pry up your shoes
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide
You know what your decision is
Which is not to decide

You'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe

In a stew, In the goo
And you've learned something, too
Something you never knew
On the steps of the palace

",On The Steps Of The Palace,1988
Paul Gemignani,"Once upon a time

I wish

In a far-off kingdom

More than anything

Lived a fair maiden

A sad young lad

I wish
And a childless baker

More than life

I wish

With his wife

More than anything

More than the moon

I wish

The King is giving a Festival

More than life

I wish

I wish to go to the Festival

More than riches

I wish my cow would
Give us some milk

More than anything

I wish we had a child

I want a child

I wish to go to the Festival

I wish you'd give us some
Milk or even cheese

I wish we might have a child
I wish

You wish to go to the Festival?

The poor girl's mother had died

You, Cinderella, the Festival?

You wish to go to the Festival?

The Festival!

The King's Festival?

And her father had taken for his new wife

The Festival

A woman with two daughters of her own

Look at you nails!

Look at your dress!

People would laugh at you
Nevertheless
I still want to go to the Festival

And dance before the Prince

All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart
Jack, on the other hand, had no father, and his mother

I wish
Well, she was not quite beautiful
I wish my son were not a fool

I wish my house was not a mess
I wish the cow was full of milk

I wish the walls was full of gold
I wish a lot of things
Why, come in, little girl

I wish
It's not for me
It's for my Granny in the woods

A loaf of bread, please
To bring my poor old hungry

Granny in the woods
Just a loaf of bread, please

Cinderella's Stepmother had a surprise for her
I have emptied a pot of lentils into the ashes for you
If you have picked them out again in two hours' time

You shall go to the ball with us

And perhaps a sticky bun?

Or four?
Birds in the sky
Birds in the eaves

In the leaves
In the fields
In the castles and ponds

And a few of those pies please
Come, little birds
Down from the eaves
And the leaves

Over fields
Out of castles and ponds

No, squeeze, pal
Ahh
Quick, little birds
Flick through the ashes

Pick and peck, but swiftly
Sift through the ashes

Into the pot
Listen well, son, Milky-White must be taken to market
But, mother, no-,he's the best cow
Look at her

There are bugs on her dugs
There are flies in her eyes

There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump

But
Son

We've no time to sit and dither
While her wither's wither with her

And no one keeps a cow for a friend!
Sometimes I fear your touched
Into the woods
It's time to go
I hate to leave

I have to, though
Into the woods

It's time, and so
I must begin my journey
Into the woods
And through the trees
To where I am

Expected ma'am

Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
You're certain of your way?
The way is clear

The light is good
I have no fear
Nor no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
I sort of hate to ask it

But do you have a basket?
Into the woods

And down the dell
The path is straight

I know it well
Into the woods
And who can tell
What's waiting on the journey?
Into the woods
To bring some bread
To Granny who
Is sick in bed
Never can tell

What lies ahead
For all that I know
She's already dead
But into the woods
Into the woods
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house

And home before dark
Fly, birds
Back to the sky
Back to the eaves
And the leaves
And the fields
And the

Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella!
Are you really wearing that?
Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella

Can't you hide it with a hat?
You look beautiful
I know
She means me

Put it in a twist

Who will be there?

Mother said be good

Father said be nice
That was always their advice

So be nice, Cinderella
Good, Cinderella

Nice good good nice

Tighter!

What's the good of being good
If everyone is blind

And you're always left behind?
Never mind, Cinderella
Kind Cinderella
Nice good nice kind good nice
Not that tight!

Sorry

Clod
Who might that be?
It's the witch from next door
The old enchantress told the couple she had

Placed a spell on their house

What spell?

In the past, when your mother was with child, she developed

An unusual appetite, she took one look at my beautiful garden
And told your father that what she wanted more than

Anything in the world was
Greens, greens and nothing but greens
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery
Asparagus and watercress and
Fiddleferns and lettuce!
He said, ""All right""

But it wasn't, quite
'Cause I caught him in the autumn

In my garden one night!
He was robbing me

Raping me
Rooting through my rutabaga

Raiding my arugula and
Ripping up my rampion

(My champion! My favorite!)
I should have laid a spell on him

Right there
Could have changed him into stone

Or a dog or a chair
But I let him have the rampion

I'd lots to spare
In return, however

I said, ""Fair is fair:
You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear

And we'll call it square""

I had a brother?
No, but you had a sister
But the witch refused to tell him anymore of his sister
Not even that her name was Rapunzel
I though I had been more than reasonable
But how was I to know what your father
Had also hidden in his pocket!

What?
Beans

Beans?
The special beans
I let him go
I didn't know
He'd stolen my beans!
I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall!
Then bang! Crash!
And the lightning flash!
And well, that's another story
Never mind
Anyway, at last
The big day came

And I made my claim
""Oh, don't take away the baby""
They shrieked and screeched
But I did
And I hid her
Where she'll never be reached

And your father cried

And your mother died
When for extra measure

I admit it was a pleasure
I said, ""Sorry

I'm still not mollified""
And I laid little spell on them
You, too, son

That your family tree
Would always be a barren one
So there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes
And my garden thrives
You should see my nectarines!
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens:

Don't ever never ever
Mess around with my greens!

Especially the beans

Now closely to me, Jack. Lead Milky-White to market and
Fetch the best price you can. Are you listening to me?
Jack Jack Jack

Head in a sack
The house is getting colder
This is not the time for dreaming
Chimney stack
Starting to crack
The mice are getting bolder
The floor's gone slack
Your mother's getting older
Your father's not back
And you can't just sit here dreaming pretty dreams
To wish and wait
From day to day
Will never keep
The wolves away

So into the woods
The time is now
We have to live
I don't care how
Into the woods
To sell the cow

You must begin the journey
Straight to the woods
And don't delay
You have to face

The marketplace
Into the woods to journey's end

Into the woods to sell a friend
Meanwhile, the Witch, for purposes of her own
Explained how the Baker might lift the spell
You wish to have
The curse reversed?
I'll need a certain
Potion first

Go to the woods and bring me back
One: the cow as white as milk
Two: the cape as red as blood
Three: the hair as yellow as corn
Four: the slipper as pure as gold

Bring me these
Before the chime
Of midnight
In three day's time

And you shall have
I guarantee
A child as perfect
As child can be
Go to the wood!
Ladies

Our carriage waits
Now may I go to the Festival?

The Festival!
Darling, those nails!
Darling, those clothes!
Lentils are one thing but
Darling, with those
You'd make us the fools of the Festival
And mortify the Prince!
Our carriage is waiting
We must be gone

Good night, Father
I wish

Look what I found in father's hunting jacket

Six beans, we'll take them with us
No!
The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell
The spell is on my house
No, no, the spell is on our house
We must lift the spell
No. You are not to come and that is final
Now what am I to return with?
You don't remember?
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
And so the Baker, reluctantly, set off to meet the
Enchantress' demands
As for Cinderella
I still wish to go to the Festival
The cow as white as milk
But how am I ever to get to the Festival?
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
I know!
I'll visit Mother's grave
The grave at the hazel tree
And tell her I just want to
Go to the King's Festival
Into the woods
It's time to go
It may be all
In vain, you/I know
Into the woods
But even so
I have to take the journey
Into the woods
The path is straight
You know it well
But who can tell
Into the woods to lift the spell
Into the woods to visit Mother
Into the woods to fetch the things
To make the potion
To got to the Festival
Into the woods
Without regret
The choice is made
The task is set
Into the woods
But not forget
Ting why I'm on the journey
Into the woods
To get my wish
I don't care how
The time is now
Into the woods to sell the cow
Into the woods to get the money
Into the woods to lift the spell
To make the potion
To go to the Festival
Into the woods to Grandmother's house
Into the woods to Grandmother's house
The way is clear
The light is good
I have no fear
No no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
No need to be afraid there
There's something in the glade there
Into the woods
Without delay
But careful not
To lose the way
Into the woods
Who knows what may
Be lurking on the journey?
Into the woods
To get the thing
That makes it worth
The journeying
Into the woods
To see the King
To sell the cow
To make the potion
To see
To sell
To get
To bring
To make
To lift
To go to the Festival!
Into the woods!
Into the woods!
Into the woods
Then out of the woods
And home before dark!",Prologue: Into The Woods,1988
Paul Gemignani,"What did I clearly say
Children should listen

No, no, please
What were you not to do
Children must see
No

And learn

Why could you not obey
Children should listen
What have I been to you
What would you have me be
Handsome like a Prince

Ah, but I am old
I am ugly
I embarrass you
No

You are ashamed of me
No

You are ashamed
You don't understand

I am no longer a child, I wish to see the world

Don't you know what's out there in the world
Someone has to shield you from the world
Stay with me

Princes wait there in the world, it's true
Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too
Stay at home
I am home

Who out there could love you more than I
What out there that I cannot supply
Stay with me

Stay with me

Stay a child while you can be a child

You end me, pal
Second bottle
Ah, she looks for me

Bonnet flapping
Yapping
Ruff
Chicken
Pastry

Yes, she looks for me good
Let her look for me
To tell me why she left me
As I always knew she would

I had thought she understood
They have never understood
And no reason that they should

But if anybody could, finishing the hat
How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when voices that come
Through the window
Go

Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky
And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light

How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see, it's the only way to see

And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""
But the women who won't wait for you knows
That, however you live

There's a part of you always standing by
Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat
Look, I made a hat
Where there never was a hat

Wot's 'is name has... 
Had... 
Has! 
Nor it can't be traced... 
Bus'ness needs a lift, 
Debts to be erased... 
Think of it as thrift, 
As a gift, 
If you get my drift! 

No? 

Seems an awful waste... 
I mean, with the price of meat
What it is, 
When you get it, 
If you get it...

Good, you got it! 

Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop!

And a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most! 
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste!

Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
LOVETT:
Well, it does seem a waste... 

TODD:
Eminently practical
And yet appropriate as always!

It's an idea...

And calls out to his reindeer

Early morning Manhattan,
Ocean winds blow on the land.
The Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It's the same old ending-time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Nightime's flyers feel their pains.
Drugstore takes down the chains.
Metal motion comes in bursts,
But the gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway,
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,
There's no whitewash victim,
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.

Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Thinks money-honey-be on-neon.

And the sawdust king spits out his scorn.

Don't look at me! I'm not your kind.
I'm Rael!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

Paul Gonsalves,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

I would not tell lies to you
Like the promises they did not keep
And how they fenced us in like sheep.
Said to us come take our hand
Sent us off to mission land.
Taught us to read, to write and pray
Then they took the children away, 
Took the children away, 
The children away.
Snatched from their mother's breast
Said this is for the best
Took them away.

The welfare and the policeman
Said you've got to understand
We'll give them what you can't give
Teach them how to really live.
Teach them how to live they said
Humiliated them instead
Taught them that and taught them this
And others taught them prejudice.
You took the children away
The children away
Breaking their mothers heart
Tearing us all apart
Took them away

One dark day on Framingham
Come and didn't give a damn
My mother cried go get their dad
He came running, fighting mad
Mother's tears were falling down
Dad shaped up and stood his ground.
He said 'You touch my kids and you fight me'

And they took us from our family.
Took us away
They took us away
Snatched from our mother's breast
Said this was for the best
Took us away.

Told us what to do and say
Told us all the white man's ways
Then they split us up again
And gave us gifts to ease the pain
Sent us off to foster homes
As we grew up we felt alone
Cause we were acting white
Yet feeling black

The children come back
The children come back
Back where their hearts grow strong
Back where they all belong

We'll, I've been called a coward, but I've seen two World Wars

I say jump back all you big suits 'cause you've got something wrong
I ain't gone, no, I ain't gone
I am still breathing and I still have my pride
And I have my memories, your life, it never dies
Like the wind that blows in thunder
Or the stallion on the fly, I got it all
And I'm standing tall underneath these blue Alberta skies

And mail it right away

Imagine there's no countries

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

From Altrincham to Chadderton, it’s rain
From Moss Side to Swinton, hardly Spain
It’s a picture postcard of 'Wish they never came'

And whilst that deckchair in the garden it makes no sense
It doesn’t spoil the view or cause offense
Those Floridas, Bavarias and Kents
Make gentlemen wear shorts but don’t make gents

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

From Cheetham Hill to Wythenshawe, it’s rain
Gorton, Salford, Sale, pretty much the same
As I’m caught up without my jacket once again
The raindrops on my face play a sweet refrain

And as winter turns reluctantly to spring
For the clouds above the city there’s one last fling
Swallows build their nests, chaffinch sing
And the sun strolls into town like long lost king

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

And the mood of this whole sodden place is melancholy
Like the sun came out to play, shone through the clouds
But dropped its lolly
And everyone looks so disappointed, so, so sorry
Like the rain blew into town, kidnapped the sun
And stole its brolly

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

Paul Heaton,"Me and the Farmer get on fine
Through stormy weather and bottles of wine
If I pull my weight he?ll treat me well
But if I?m late he?ll give me hell
And thought it?s all hard work no play
Farmer is a happy crook
Jesus hates him everyday
?cause jesus gave and farmer took

{won?t he let you go? } probably no
{why does he treat you so? } I just don?t know

Me and the farmer like brother, like sister
Getting on like hand and blister
Me and the farmer

He?s chopped down sheep, planted trees
And helped the countryside to breathe
Ripped up fields, bullied flocks
And worked his workers right around the clock

It may seem strange but he?d admit
Intentions aren?t exactly true
And through God loves his wife a bit
He hates the farmer through and through

Paul Heaton,"Old Red eyes is back
Red from the night before the night before
Walked into the wrong bar walked into a door

Old Red's in town
And sitting late at night he doesn't make a sound
Just adding to the wrinkles on his deathly frown

They're only red from all the tears that I should've shed
They're only red from all the women that I could've wed
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue

Listen up Old Red
You never listened to a word the doctor said
He told you if you drank another you'd be dead

Old Red Eyes is back
His shoulders ache all over and his brain is sore
He pours a drink and listens to his body thaw

They're only red from all the thoughts unused inside my head
They're only red from all the things I could have done instead
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue

Blue is a street without an end
Red is the color of my hell
Blue is a greeting from a friend
Red is the color of farewell

Old Red he died
And every single landlord in the district cried
An empty bottle of whiskey laying by his side
A lazy little tear running from each eye
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue",Old Red Eyes Is Back,

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms

I thought was from a leakin' sink
I phoned the plumber to rush right over
See if he could fix the leak

He rushed right in and he took a look
Much to my surprise

It's teardrops from your eye

I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Paul Horn,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

"Paul Jackson, Jr.","There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Remember that special night
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share, and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing to you
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you
Let's wait awhile
Ah well before it's too late
You know you can't rush love, love

Let's wait awhile
(Ooh hoo hoo)
Before it's too late
(Let's wait awhile)
Wait awhile
(Our love will be great)
Let's wait awhile
(Wait awhile, ooh)
Before we go too far, oh, oh, ooh

Let's wait awhile
(Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
(Let's wait awhile)
Your love's so good
(Our love will be great)
We shouldn't rush in
(Let's wait awhile)
Slow it down
(Before we go too far)
Ooh

"Paul Jackson, Jr.","Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya,
From that radio
It's just
Another

"Paul Jackson, Jr.","Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see

Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

"Paul Jackson, Jr.","I looked at you 
You stole my heart 
You were all that I anticipated 
I wanted you -- Every part but I knew that love would be complicated 
I began to touch -- But you wouldn't let it 
It never seemed to be the right time 
I started to give up -- down to the limit 
And then you changed your mind 

And we begin to rock steady 
Steady rockin' all night long 
And we begin to rock steady 
Rockin' till the break of dawn 

You looked at me to my surprise 
You were through anticipating 
I should have known -- It was in your eyes 
That you were gettin' tired of waiting 
You wanted me so much -- But I didn't get it 
How could a fellow be so blind? 
I started to give up -- But love wouldn't let it 
Then you walked into my life 

And we begin to rock steady 
Steady rockin' all night long 
And we begin to rock steady
