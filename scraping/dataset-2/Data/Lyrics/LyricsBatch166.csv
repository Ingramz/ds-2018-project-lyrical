Don't Look Down,"Just another day 
Far away from being myself
Can't explain my situation
But I think I'm someone else
Sick of all your stories
The lying has affected me
When I look in the mirror 
Nothing looks back at me

Just another day goes by
That you look the other way
Just another day goes by
That I see you fade away

Just another day and
I don't know what to do 
Let me sit here by myself
Thinkin' how to make it through
Just the same old story 
I get left behind
These thoughts run through my head
Will they never die

Just another day goes by
That you look the other way
Just another day goes by
That I see you fade away

Just another day 
That I'm getting over you
The wall you built up lies
I finally see through
This is your last story
The last one you tell me
And when I look at the mirror
I stare back at me

Just another day goes by
That you look the other way
Just another day goes by
That I see you fade away

Just another day goes by
That you look the other way
Just another day goes by
That I see you fade away",Fade,2002
Don't You Wanna Know Herr,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Don-E,"Mama, don't run away

younawmsayin' son?
shit is real
yo, I'm from a place where niggaz get it on
and bullshitters get shitted on
and dead niggaz keep living on
and memories once the henny's pourin'
I see the sadness of so many mourned
yet the beauty of so many born
and the only man I trust is god
cause the devil come in many forms
on the day I rest eternally
I'll be a thug for eternity
the longer word is fire burning me
but you younger thugs could learn from me
love is love..",Intro,2004
Dona,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,

There's a modern villunworser than that old boogie woogie,

Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible 
buzz,
But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The 
Jitterbug does;
So be careful of that rascal,
Keep away from The Jitterbug, The Jitterbug.

Doña Oxford,"When I had you to myself 
I didn't want you around 
Those pretty faces always made you 
Stand out in a crowd 
But someone picked you from the bunch 
One glance was all it took 
Now it's much too late for me 
To take second look 

Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart 

Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
I want you back 
Yes I do now 
I want you back 
Ooh ooh baby 
Yeah yeah, naw 

Trying to live without your love 
Is one long sleepless night

Donae'o,"Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

(Whoa! Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something?
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me, look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, yeah, but, what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you, too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I'll continue
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

And just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

You're fit but you know it
But you know it
You're fit but you know it

I think I'm going to fall o-

By her body in the isle of mist,

One last cold kiss.

They brought him twenty ladies he would take no other bride.

Once so proud he's beaten now, he will not speak at all.

Don't call me back again.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Really do come true.

Donald Byrd,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain",Stardust,1958

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,

I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [From One Touch of Venus],1959

G TOP - GRU... - Guru Lyrics - Loungin Lyrics 

Yea I'm loungin' I got my man Donald Byrd 
I wanna give a big shout out to my little man Miko he's 2 years old 
He's away visiting his grandmom but I miss him dearly 

Check it out 
If I rhyme this you will find this situation shall advance 
You could take a glance or dance 
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd 
Now tell me who's the man to show you how 
Many legacies of brothers who get buzy 
And I do it fluid til the suckers get dizzy 
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street 
And check the flow that's unique 
For loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 

Can't refuse this, never lose this, it's the choice this 
'Cause my voice is the smoothest 
Dominating to your boys 'cause I've been around doing work 
And sold tons of others jerk 
Donald Byrd word on the track, quite exact 
Giving you the format, Jack 
See we gotta pave the way and display 
How to loungin', loungin' 
Mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 

Peace to the pioneers but I gotta try to clear 
My throat, check out what I wrote 
You can't tap into this unless you know the roots 
Word shoe like light absolute 
For real so now you gotta know the deal 
For loungin', just loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin' mellow out, check it ou and loungin' 

Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', peace to Brooklyn where I live 

Realistic, kind of mystic when I kick this 
You should witness the slickness 
Of the hornplayer and the dope rhymesayer 
Quite emotional and inspirational 
Philisophical and yes very logical 
Teaching you the method for loungin' 

Everybody knows they have times when they wanna just lay back 
kick their feet up, y'know 
listen to some good music and just lounge 
That's right, I said lounge ",Loungin',1993

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

 Spannin' the glove like Wild World of Sports 
 I go to Japan, with plans to slam (aight) 
 I go to Spain and England, with knowledge to bring them 
 (crazy knowledge) I go to Holland, and then to Germany 
 You better learn to see I'll be here for eternity (a long time) 
 I go to Switzerland and travel to Sweden 
 And give the real heads jewels that they needin' (droppin' jewels) 
 I go to Italy and also to France 
 With the chance to enhance the dance (c'mon) 
 I tore up mad spots doin' shows all over 
 I wreck the stage, with East coast flavor (East coast)

 (uh-huh) The fuse is lit, makin your whole crew split 
 No myth (word), yeah 
 I'm whippin evil everywhere, ratification severely severe 
 (aight) So clearly you hear 
 Original aspects unlimited, significant thoughts 
 That make me different than (different than) 
 Most men who play the edge too close 
 And while they fall, I fill halls coast to coast (everywhere) 
 The dressing rooms I roam in is the scent of blessings (boom) 
 Soon as we rockets to the next spot to wreck em 
 I put the pure in the store, I got the cure (c'mon) 
 Like a doc-tor, switchin' from planes, to helicopters

It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

From the ceiling I watch your body hang
This is the payback, my trigger I pull back
Your cap is peeled back, for givin' me feedback

I want the loot, you got the loot, gimme the loot
I won't hesitate to fuckin' shoot
Night stalker, I talk street slang
Fuck that shit, I don't play no games

No remorse, my mind's on psycho
Watch me flow on, the angry tempo
Load the clip, let's take a trip
You tried to flip - my blade terminated his lips

Sucka... that's why you're tossed up
For tryin' to double-cross the boss up
I move in silence
In a world that contains, much much violence

Sex and drugs, hoods and thugs

Niggas act a fool now bullets rang out
I duck for cover cause with bullets you cannot reason
To catch a body, it's the season

I'm fussin' but my cussin' don't mean jack nothin'

So the pigs in blue start to drive

Inner city blues is nothin' new
We go to the store to buy some brew
On the pavement I pour some ale
For my homies who died, my homies in jail

Skins, skins with sex to lend
Stood out y'all like a shark's fin
Uhh, a cutie with a weave to her booty
Shakes her rump to the funk that car system pumps

She wants to sex me up, sex me down
I smack it and I flip it and I dick her down
Check it, now she want to play footsy
But I want the loot, and she's just pussy

They want me to rot, in the belly of the beast
You want to cuff me, come and get me

In the ghetto back alley he lays in trash
He didn't know so I had to buck him

(I thought he was your man) Yo nigga, FUCK HIM
Police sirens, let's make a move
Criminal smooth, pimp daddy cool
Eyes on my jewels I pull out my toolie

Meet your maker you no-good stoolie
Damn!  I smell police creepin'
Damn!  Even when Donald D sleepin'
Say hello to my little friend

The Desert Eagle, adios amigo
Gangsta chronicle you read the articles
Raise it to the neck, I'm wet from the sweat
Vigilante, servin' em death blows

A sinister call rips away the jaw
Decapitated by the guillotine
The aftermath a bloodbath scene
Beware, of the looter
The syndicate sniper, I'm the sharpshooter

Just can't do what the captain say
There's not enough night
And too much day ain't got time to hear

That stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down

Wish I was a hired gun
A cruel shogun, a poor man's son
One day I'd stop and click my heels
Turn around to see

My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down

The troubadour is in disguise
Bats and curious I use my eyes
My own two hands were on the keys
This was no mystery

I was helpless
Like a small child
No eyes of my own

No moonlight to guide me
No shadow to hide me
There in the dark
I found Sun Mountain
I once had a friend
Tried to help me
In a bad way
When I got to the end
Of a long and lonely highway
Strung out and down-hearted
Right back where I started
There in the dark
I found Sun Mountain
Here in my world
I remember
All the things I left behind
And if I need them
They will be there
A part of my mind
It's only a house
And the rooftop
Is the blue sky
No windows or walls
And the days or years pass by 
I slept through the daylight
I woke up, it was midnight
There in the dark
I found Sun Mountain",Sun Mountain,1986

On where she wants to be

And the flowers that she wore 
Years ago I tried to tell her 
What was in my heart

She took the money from my old man

Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him.
So bold with his gun in his hand,
Of his furs there was no need to remind him.

Mind that here you don't choose your friends,
Ambrose asked for a helping hand,
He heaved his chest, and pointed West,
To where the river runs.

Brushing off the fruit flies of the season,
And 'Brosie was surely struck blind,
By a sight that defies human reason:
On an island of gleaming rock,
Jutting up from the blue lagoon,
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode,
That made our hero swoon.

As you know played out its bloody romances.
But Ambrose he knew what he'd learned,
With his prize in hand he took his chances.

I'm half a man 
With half a heart
I hear you laughing
And I fall apart
I'd like to put it on the table

You do me wrong and it's bringing me down

For keeping it neat
Everybody's laughin'

I'm blowing my fuse

Has your juggernaut reached my door? 
Am I out of range?

Try to design a postcard from your mind

Donald Fagen,"Will you walk a little faster?, said a whiting to a snail
There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail
Don't you see how eagerly the turtles and the lobsters all advance
They are waiting on the shingle, won't you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
(3x)
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters in the sea
But the snail replied ""Too far, too far!"" and gave a look askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance
[Chorus]
(2x)
[Ba ba ba ba ba ba etc continuous background to end]
What matters it how far we go? his scaly friend replied
There is another shore, you know, upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance

Just can't do what the captain say
There's not enough night
And too much day

A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound

When you shake your booty,

You stare into the distance, looking for a sign
But that sign it never comes babe, your wishes won't come true
You keep praying for the rain while the sun beats down on you

We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said ""you need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song""
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone, now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying ""go hard""
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out, ""it's the best,"" no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself
No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her ""I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help""
She text me ""how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?""
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, ""you see what these labels do to me""
Texts said ""I'm Wet"", I said ""hold up, wait up a minute""
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up

Donald Lawrence,"Don't forget to remember where your blessings come from.
Don't forget to give honour where honour is due.
Don't forget to give thanks to the One who put you there.
Don't forget where your blessings come from.

When you get a little money,
Get up on your feet,
Why do we change?

Get a little fortune and fame,
Sign a title to your name,
Why do we change?

Just like the ten in the Bible days,
Who were blessed by the Lord
And went on their way.
Except one came back with gratitude,
We've got to give honour where it is due.

Where all our blessings,
Where all our blessings come from.

Substance abuse, gang violence, suicide
Because of low self esteem

Speak life over yourself and those you love

how can we stand in the midst of trouble when the enemy laughs at our beliefs

that's why he died I know this life may not be easy
But when you're all alone in your weakness he's strong.
So let your song ring out lift your voice and shout it loud
He put joy down in your soul now this sin sick world must know that he lives
Inside you he's always there to guide you when your
When your backs against the wall keep on singing when you have no friends at all
Keep on singing
When your down and can't see your way he'll be there to bring you a brighter day

You still need time to heal I can help if you'll only let me try

It’s been too long, and like you, I can’t do without it
It hurts, I can’t breathe well at all
That’s real love when you can’t exhale tomorrow
Won’t be pleasant, it’s dark even if the sun shines
My mind too cloudy they can hear my cries through the walls, neighbors
See the morning papers at my door, him through my vent praying for my sores
Not livin’ well cause hell I miss you like Williams, Venus
Inner space I pray to God, every day I’m dreamin’
God, save me, I need my baby back
Goin’ crazy like Shady, this is proof of that
Can’t breathe, don’t really need no noose for that
Hangin’ myself throwin' this liquor back, off a track
We all go through rocky roads and we both react
I got your call and I called to say I’m comin’ back

Want you to come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Yea, come on home to me baby

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

making spirits bright,

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle all the way!

the story I must tell

And on my back I fell;

In a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!

And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

To make your time more easy passing?

How can, how can you ask me again?

I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailing
Saying, I don't know when I'll be coming back again

If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roaming
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me

Take heed of stormy weather

And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields

They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page

They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end

Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2014
Donald Shaw,"After the morning there comes an evening
And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say

I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung

As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree

""What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree""

He looked around and he saw her coming
And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind

Come down, come down from that cruel gallows
I've got your pardon from the king
And I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green",The Streets of Derry,2014
