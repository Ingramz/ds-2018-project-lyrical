I need to call my old time, used to be.
Somebody loan me a dime,
Mmm, I need to call my old time, used to be.
Oooo, little girl's been gone so long,
You know it's worryin me.

Yeah, she's a good girl,
But, at that time I just didn't understand.

But, at that time I just could not understand.
Whoa, no.
Somebody better loan me that dime,
To ease my worried mind.
Whoo.

Just like a baby, all night long.

Whooo, somebody better loan me that dime,

Oooo, yeah.

Boz Scaggs,"Day after day
He goes out of his way
'Cause he knows you're gonna be there
And if he doesn't say too much
At least he keeps in touch, to show his care

And it ain't like he never loved before
And it ain't like he'll never love no more
It's just that someday, maybe
He'll find some way baby
To turn you around

He may just be right
Why, is he so in love with you
Why, don't he find something else to do

Well, it ain't what he loves you for
And it ain't that you got so much more
It's just that sometimes someone
Got to play the dumb one to get along
(And you may just get along)

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

Laugh and be gay, ooh
You look so nice that way
You know you'll get a smile
Wear a ribbon in your hair
He'll notice that it's there
Just his style

You just state your case and sing the song
And you take it as it comes along
Who knows someday maybe
You'll take a look out baby, and find you care

And I know you'll be there

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

Around the lane and into the night
Goodbye this time may be the last

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little

Evening song didn't last long
Dreamed I was right sussed I was wrong
So I make my way through an empty day

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little, this time

Never believed she would leave
I forgot about last time
When she walked out this morning
I went out of my mind

I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
I'll try to fight down to the last

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little, this time

Some people live and learn
Never was lucky that way
Wanted so hard to believe her

But other rains will come
And wash it all away
Other loves will come and go
You must believe me when I say
Didn't want it that way

I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing

Boz Scaggs,"All around the water tank
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain

I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He says ""If you've got the money
I'll see that you don't walk""

I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny I can show
""Get off, get off, you railroad bum""
He slammed the boxcar door

He put me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above

Nobody seems to want me
Or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going to Dixie land

Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Just waiting for a train",Waiting for a Train,1974
Boz Scaggs,"Cause of fear is fear itself
Check out your own back yard
Before you check out someone else
Railroad tracks in my neighborhood
Ain't no trains around, that boy just ain't no good

Wanna know what's going down
And the pimp on the corner
Looks like the sharpest cat in town

Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Might get caught by the hook or the crook
Hot time for cool (hot time for cool)
Look out Jake what you say
What you carrying brother
I hope you're clean cause the man is mean
Don't have another brother

We all know the answer will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load along with mine
Thank you ma'am, mister please
But I must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

I just wanna be free enough to do my thing

Got to be down with the cats around
And you still gotta face that man

Talk about me if you please
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

Boz Scaggs,"I have never loved a lady
Never touched no silken knee
Macon baby, you drove me crazy
You were so easy to me

Lay me down in Georgia pine cones
Whisper to me through the trees
You're the one I always dream of
You're the only one I see

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer holds the answer
Only you can set me free

Never see your face in sunlight
Moonlight sends you straight to me
You never even got my name right
You were so easy to me

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer
Only you can set me free

Boz Scaggs,"Son of a Tokyo Rose
I was bound to wander from home
Stranger to whatever I'd awaken to
Spun the wheel
Took a shot in the dark
One way ticket and a runaway heart
A Sailors dream came true
The night I dreamed of you

Through the neon doorways
Down the stony streets I fell
All hands high side
All eyes a wreck I followed
Sailing shadows reds and blues
Curtains drawn but I saw through
The window to your soul
And I found you

Woah oh oh oh
The harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back
To you my love
To you my love
To you my love
Ooh ooh ooh

My eyes must be betrayin'
But that lonesome jukebox playin'
Somethin' 'bout the harbor lights
Is calling me
Back to some Jamaican bay
Doesn't seem so far away
Keep the change
But I'll repay these memories

Dawn came in this morning
Like some old junked out melody
The words she spoke as we awoke still haunt me
""What you feel too
Won't reveal you
Let me steal you for my life""

Woah oh oh oh
The harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back

Boz Scaggs,"There was a howl that night
A howling like they never heard before
A cry so loud old granddad almost hit the door
He said, ""I love this child as much as any one that she ever bore,
But I thank the Lord we won't be having any more.""

Then the baby heard the sweetest sound he'd ever heard
In tones so beautiful he hung on every word
She sang, ""Hush, my love, granny's little dove is going to take to the sky.""
It was on such a night he learned to fly like a bird.

Now the years have passed and memories come and go
He hears that voice that rocked him gently so
A calm will descend and there's peace at the end of the darkest night
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I fly like a bird.

He takes a smoke
Takes a paper
He takes me along for the ride

We go deeper
Into the quarter
Through a rain slaked dampness into an alley
The smell of garbage and perfume
Brick by brick
His woman meets me
But it doesn't matter
Anyway, whose chasing who
I'm just holding the bag]

What about the one who said he cared

And you played without a care
But not up in the high sierra
You won't play his heart out there

They line up for him every night
Some have wings and others sing
The rest do lazy ballets in the air

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

If your body's fit and your mind is clear
No reason you ought not to be

But go down to the gym or find a place to swim
And ask the doctor if you can't jog

When you're running and climbing and jumping around

Boz Scaggs,"Sing a song of sad young men
Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again
Kiss your dreams goodbye

All the sad young men
Sitting in the bars
Knowing neon lights
And missing all the stars

All the sad young men
Drifting through the town
Drinking up the night
Trying not to drown

All the sad young men
Singing in the cold
Trying to forget
That they're growing old

All the sad young men
Choking on their youth
Trying to be brave
Running from the truth

Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part

All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold
For a little while

Tired little girl
Does the best she can
Trying to be gay
For a sad young man

While the grimy moon
Watches from above
All the sad young men
Play at making love

Misbegotten moon
Shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light
Guide them home tonight
All the sad young men

Telling stories that no one believes

Oh Dindi
If I only had words
I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me, oh my Dindi

Oh Dindi

That's how my heart is singing, Dindi
Happy Dindi, when you're with me

I love you more each day
Yes I do, yes I do

It kinda spoils your happy hour

Look around, we're comin' your way
It's a wonder to us how you ever thought
You'd get away, what you say
Well, the way it looks from here
You won't have to wait

The way it looks from here
No need to hesitate
Have a party celebrate
The way it looks from here
You won't have to wait for hell to pay

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

Working for the man just the way my daddy done

The telephone keeps ringin' and it gets under my skin
They all call to ask me when I'll send the money in
But AT&T does a favor for me and takes a message at the tone
Sometimes I gotta do somethin' even if it's wrong

Seems the road is gettin' rougher as I roll on up the hill
High times passin' by me just like I was standin' still
But I'm almost to the top and I'll go until I drop
Some fall by the wayside but I've gone too far to stop

The woman of my dreams she was like a livin' doll
I sent her far away when she set me for a fall
She was a digger and the bills got bigger and I was up against the wall
Sometimes you gotta do somethin' even if it's wrong

Now I hear those wolves a howlin' I can't get no sleep at all
The good Lord knows I'm tired of robbin' Peter to pay Paul
From the grind stone to the gravestone is it really worth it all
Sometimes you gotta do somethin' even if it's wrong
Seems the road is gettin' rougher...

There goes the arms that used to hold me tight
There goes the reason that I sigh there goes the reason that I cry
There goes the lips I used to kiss goodnight there goes my love
Well you're the first love of my life and you might be my last
I don't want to be just another memory in your past

BR5-49,"I was takin' a trip out to LA,
Toolin' along in my Chevrolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio

Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go

Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight
So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn

Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one

There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me
And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone

I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy t'day
And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so

He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother
Tellin' the durn fool 
I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go

I jes ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car
With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor

Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd jus wait outside
So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door

Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dude come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth

An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said you tip your hat to this lady son
An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath

Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me

Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick
So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green-teeth right in the knee

He let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man

Well you may not know it but this man's a spy
He's an undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan

He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me
And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went

I said would you beleive this man has gone as far
As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGoveren for president

Well he's a friend of them long-haired hippie type pinko fags
I betcha he's even got a Commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage

He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage

They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim
You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life

I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife

Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck

And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks
And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up

Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot

An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run
But somehow I couldn't resist the fun
Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot

Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air

Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there

When I hit the road I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas

I think I'm gonna re-route my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to LA via Omaha!

BR5-49,"I rolled out this morning, kids had the morning news show on
Bryant Gumble was talking 'bout the fighting in Jerusalem
Some senator was squawking 'bout the bad economy
It's gonna get worse you see, we need to change a policy

There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad story's one more then I can stand
Just once how I'd like to see the headline say
Not much to print today, can't find nothing bad to say

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'ed, nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger, nobody had to die in vain
I sure could use a little good news today

I'll come home this evening I bet that the news'll be the same
Somebody takes a hostage somebody steels a plane
How I wanna hear the anchorman talk about a county fair
And how we cleaned up the air, how everybody learned to care because

Nobody was assassinated in the whole good world today
And in the streets of Ireland all the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA
I sure could use a little good news today

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'ed, nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger, nobody had to die in vain

We threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else.

When this town was so high
We could never come down
When rules did not apply
We would drink fountains dry
In a club filled with sound

And bands would play to please me
You found a partner easy
Then the name game was the only game in town

Nights would end at 6 A.M.
You sleep all day
And then start dancing again
The first to see the end
We did the Continental American

All our clothes from France
Soul Train taught us to dance
We had smoke in our eyes
Friends were lost and found
We were paradise bound
Some got lost, nobody cried

But others took their places
Always strange new faces
Always one more chance to go around

And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could've let you know somehow

I guess, every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorns

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways

But now, I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger
But a stable turntable
I do what I do best
Because I'm willing and able.

Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? Blow it out ya ass!
In one year I got rich, now life's moving so fast
But being broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all praying that I flop? Blow it out ya ass!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm getting for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? Blow it out ya ass!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed 'em
Niggas hate giving me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! Blow it out ya ass!

If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes, blow it out ya ass!

If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home

I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer
If you ever think of stopping me, Bblow it out ya ass!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm looking into buying Greenbriar Mall
You probably own a lot of property! Blow it out ya ass!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls
Plus his money keeps flowing like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation, blow it out ya ass!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'ma throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a thief and got a way with words
I'ma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation, blow it out ya ass!

If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong

And Latinos always waiting for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, ""Dude, you fucking rock!""
Yo' fans are my fans, right? Blow it out ya ass!
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream
Yo' scans are my scans, right? Blow it out ya ass!
Now Luda's throwing up A's, and I'm lighting up L's
Around the globe getting paid, you home biting yo' nails
DTP, the only label that practice fighting ourselves
We probably getting on your nerves, huh? Blow it out ya ass!

I get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer
Watch out, my album's putting up McDonald's numbers
You over 6 million served, huh? Blow it out ya ass!

If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home

Too many rookies, not enough pros

So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch!

I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical FOOL
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
No holds barred but obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anyone like ya (Hell no!)
I treat humans like students (Fail y'all)
So turn ya books to page 69 and start sucking
When Organized drop the tracks then start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed start fucking
You wanna be starting something Get out the booth 
And lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's
Save all the H20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean
Light skinded nigga turn red but get green
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans

Boy you done lost yo' mind
No I've lost my virginity
And I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy

Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and things
And watch for impostors that's been in the game
We invented the game and y'all just got hip

Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
Chilling in the gut with no trace of Tom Hanks
So put this in yo' jaw like wieners and beef franks

I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Did you know that?  Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames
Rearrange, same broad different night
Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
The highlight's that I live a high ass life

running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition 
is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on 
a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision 
is the status I attain
My accomplishments are 
worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies 
to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow 
to use the life I willingly lay down
I surrender all the triumph for 
it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, 
I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, 
and all I've known 
Now belongs to You, 
the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac 
on the sacraficial fire
If all I have is all that You desire
I surrender all",I Surrender All,1999
Brad Cole,"I've walked along a hundred highways
Some I wish I could forget
And I've burned a lot of bridges
But there's not one that I regret
'Cause every path I've taken
They all have led me to knowing my place
My place is with you

I've had my promises forsaken
Into many empty words
And I'm amazed and so astounded
That I won't get what I deserve
Whatever lies I've lived for
I have finally found the truth
I know my place, my place is with you

You are my treasure forever
The one dream I've searched for

I've not been given my tomorrow
I'm only certain of today
If I don't see another sunrise
I will not have to be afraid
I know we will be together
When all my days are through
I know my place, my place is with you",My Place Is with You,1999
Brad Cooper,"I want this moment for a lifetime,
I mean a lifetime
You give it all til nothing's left
and that's the right time
I been buildin' this foundation for a minute
You ain't gotta be optometrist for you to see my vision
I'm a voice for the voiceless
Like that D boy buildin' his kingdom, brick after brick
That's feelin' that God done lost him and thinking he got no options
Don't know what that life will cost him.
I swear that's some of my family y'all
And you know that I do this for y'all
So you see God the only reason I made it at all
I sit down and hear your heart, like a stethoscope
Then I get up on this mic and tell it for the world to know
Unless the Lord buildin' it, I can guarantee it's broke
That's why I be spittin' with all this passion when you hear my flow

Now I can tell you 'about my new home
Brand new car that's on chrome
But two years later that's old, everybody's moved on
Gone, I'm tryna make it count with this song
Yeah, with this song

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

It's crazy how times change
Tryna redecorate my life, switched the pictures in my mind frames
Went from hidin' to seekin', trying' to find faith
Now we speak with our feet and our hands, call it sign lang
You age, we get older turn pages
Corners folded, tryna hold on to our place in this maze
See we gave, years of grown' fast pace it's clear to know
Want a direction we would go and that's what we call His grace
And we're still here
No more letters in them bottles, message still clear
Lived our lives for a throttle, tryna fail fair
Ever our foods flash MacDonald's, slow it down
Change up the pitch somethin' like vibrato
But eventually we find this
If you mention all the times that you acted wild and mindless
Rewind it, that's simply just a line that
Minus sign, it change the sum of our lives
Man, this victor is timeless

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

I wanna leave somethin' important on this Earth before I die
So many watches I done purchased, but I still ain't buyin' time
You see doubt is like a brain tumor, it torture those alive
So I'm askin' God to please remove this evil from my mind, yeah
I wanna live without these chains on me
So much dirt, I wanna live without these stains on me
Lord I need Your grace on me
God I live to see Your face only
And by faith only, You know that I want this to last forever

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever",Last Forever,2015

Blue Collar Nights

(J. Steele/B. Allmand)


If you don't count the overtime, it's a 40 hour grunt

This American dream ain't easy on a paycheck twice a month

SSI FICA fedral and state tax, only thing it's good for is settin' a man back


But I've got a 20 in my pocket and I'm gettin' the first round

And there's a band in the corner and they're gonna rock the house

And them girls from the Skynard show, how much you wanna bet

There all ready in the back shootin' pool and smokin' cigarettes

And we might get lucky, if we play our cards right

Chances are I'll end up drunk just trying to pick a fight

Singing Whoa all the way home.. Yeah we'll shoot out the lights

Its a Blue Collar Night.


I'm still in that same red brick flat me and Gina hunted down,

Cinder block shevles and the lime green sofa pull out.

Been two years since I've seen her leave in that corvette.

When I look around this dump sometimes I see why she left.


But I've been savin' up my money, started goin' back to school

and I'm learning them computers and maybe in a year or two.

I can start a little business and if I get it off the ground.

I can talk the bank into a loan for that place Gina dreamed about.

And I bet she'll come crawling back, I'll be sittin' here till then

Drinkin' beer and throwin' darts and having laughs with all my friends.


Singing whoa all the why home. yeah we'll shoot out the lights, it's a blue collar night

Yeah


I came home to Gina's sweet voice coming out of my machine

Said that LA sunshine is even better than I dreamed

I rewound 3 more times, called my steve

I said lets go, he said I'm broke, I said grab your keys


Cause I've got a 20 in my pocket and I'm gettin' the first round,

And there's a band in the corner, they're gonna rock the house

And those girls from the Skynard show, how much you wanna bet

They're already in the back shootin' pool and smokin' cigarettes.

Yeah we might get lucky if we play our cards right

But chances are we'll end up drunk just trying to pick a fight

Singing Whoooo all the way home

Yeah we'll shoot out the lights

Its a Blue Collar Night.


Whooo all the way home

Yeah we'll shoot out the lights

Its a blue collar.....its a blue collar night

Somehow, someway.

Sometimes it's hard to be a rock to you and no one else
You put the hurt down deep and you keep it to yourself
You wanna go out and get stoned and find out how you feel,

Brad Cotter,"We'd be sittin' there in church
In a world of our own
With our glazed over eyes
Lookin' like we were stoned

Rumor swept the congregation
But that's not how it was
We were just two crazy kids
High on love

Our young emotions raised suspicions
In their world weary eyes
We found a way to find our dreams
In an 89 Chevrolet down by the river side
High on love

We had an over zealous sheriff
Always following my car
And two sets of nervous parents
Worried we'd go too far
If they'd have known how right they were
They'd have broken us up
We were just two crazy kids
High on love

In their world weary eyes

In an 89 Chevrolet down by the river side

It ain't easy growin' up
In a three stop light town
Every time we'd try to move on
Somebody'd slow us down
Even after all this time
You can hear the town buzz
We're still two crazy kids
High on love

We're just two crazy kids
High on love

Yeah, we're two crazy kids
High on love",High on Love,2004
Brad Cotter,"I grew up in a town where tough was a cigarette
And a souped up car on a county road
Nothin' much to do back then so we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold

And I held my own
I learned to hold my own

Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday Bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
That there was more to life than that so I ran the streets to beat the Devil

Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
I didn't come here to die

Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy 'till I got home
Daddy, he'd say, ""Listen son"", but back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know

I reckon I was doing close to 80
When I felt the tire slip out from underneath
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me

And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smokin' gas in my eyes
And He said, ""Son, you came here to live
You didn't come here to die""

Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
I met a girl in town, put some money down
On a little house with a yard

Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was sittin' there at his side

You didn't come here to die

Brad Cotter,"VERSE 1

Things get in the way
The rush of everyday
Ordinary stuff we all get into
Wouldn't it be sad, if all you ever had
was a granite epitaph that said ""I meant to""

CHOURS:

So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss
Any crazy thing I didn't do, ""I meant to""

Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye
and make him tell the naked truth, ""I meant to""

I'm always on the run some things get lost some get done
But if I didn't have all the fun I meant to, ""I meant to""

And if I never came out and said to each and everyone I love, how much I really do, ""I meant to""

VERSE 2

Maybe this one chance
Is all we really have
Maybe all you got, is what you get to
Well I ain't gonna cry
I'll give it my best try
Then kiss the world goodbye and say ""I meant to""

My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town

If we drown then we'll be delivered
You can still see the picture upon the wall
One eye staring at nothing at all
The other one trying to focus through all your tears
You can try and try but there's nothing to hide
You can't run from yourself and what's inside
You got to find the answers to the questions that you most fear

So over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says tonight the truth will be told

You surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Putting your faith in things that only make you cry
People say they love you when they want to help
But how can they when you can't help yourself?
The more they say they love you, the more you just want to die
So here we go again, the self analysis
Have another glass of Port and uh, forget this
The band's playing at the club tonight and they're bound to groove

There you are, you think you're high
You can't ask yourself 'cause you'd only lie
If you had a dollar for every time you tried

You can't call nobody cause they'll tell you straight up
Come and make love when you really hate 'em
Relationships based on the physical are over and done
They're over and done (They're over and done)
You'd rather have fun
With only one, with only one
Only one, one (one)

And then it hit you like a fist on a wall
Who gave you life when there was none at all?
Who gave the sun permission to rise up everyday? (Ooh, oh yes)
Let me tell it (Go on)
If you ask God to love you longer
Every breath you take will make you stronger
Keeping you happy (happy) and proud to call His name (Go on and say it)
Jesus (Jesus)

And over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside said tonight the truth will be told
And this time I was listening, hear me

Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered (Yes we will)
If we don't then we'll never see the light (No)
If you die before you try
You'll have to come back and face the light (Oh yes)
When you believe it, you got a good reason to cry (Oh my, my)

So I went on down to the holy river
I called my girl and told her I had something to give her
I asked her to marry me and she said yes, I cried
Oh, that night I drowned in her tears and mine
And.. and instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
Looking back y'all, I don't miss nothing except the time
And when I see that picture upon the wall
The one eye staring at nothing at all
My eyes trying to focus but these are much different tears

Help me to see things through your eyes,
That we can bring healing to the broken,
When we speak the words that you have spoken,

How will they hear unless we speak,
You are the only one we need,
How will they know until we go,

Send me I'll go,
(We will be the ones, who will tell the whole wide world. 
Search the world, I will go, I will go)
Send me I'll go,
(I will be the one who will manifest your love, 
feed the hungry soul, send me God)
Send me I'll go.",Send Me,2009
Brad Garrett,"I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
But despite my evil look
And my temper, and my hook
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart?
Tickling the ivories 'til they gleam?
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley
Thank you!
'Cause way down deep inside

See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem!
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers
Like everybody else
I've got a dream!

I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes
And let's not even mention my complexion
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter, and my nose
I really want to make a love connection
Can't you see me with a special little lady
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream
I've got a dream!

Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it, dreaming 
Like everybody else
I've got a dream

Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime
Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

I have dreams, like you, no, really!
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere
Warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!
I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!

Lanterns gleam!

Brad Goode,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty

I've got a good dog and house that feels like home
Woman who loves me a lot more then she should

I guess I could just sit here and complain
About what ain't right
But you'll find me down on my knees
Just thanking the lord for my life
'Cause I've got it good

Well, I ain't rich but I have money I can spend
Enough to have some fun and go out on weekends
God has forgiven me when no one else would

About what ain't right
But you'll find me down on my knees

Plenty of people who will miss me when I'm gone

Brad Johnson,"I was born a believer, biggest dreamer this world has ever seen 
Ready to face most anything but learn that I was naive 
Ran into things in life that I never planned 
But that's made me who I am 

I've had highs and lows and seen my share of ups and downs 
There's been nights it seemed there wasn't a friend to be found 
I've had to save myself from drowning in a sea of tears. 
But I'm still here 

('Cause) I, I'm a survivor 
I won't let it get the best of me, I'll try my very best to be that strong 
Oh, oh, oh, I, I'm a survivor 
And I'll never give up, never let out, never give in 
I'll just keep moving on 

Oh 
I was taught that honesty was simply the only way 
I've spoken honestly and had it blow up in my face 
Sometimes I look around and I don't know what I see 
But I gotta believe in God above and what he's made me 

No 
I've witnessed pride and ego destroy the kindest of hearts 
Seen how gread can take the best of friends and tear them apart 
Every corner, every turn, every lesson I have learned 
Has helped me find my way 

I, I'm a survivor 
I won't let it get the best of me, I'll try my very best to be that strong

Brad Jordon,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'm a make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memory, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah hey yeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Rain,2007

Knows what's goin' on between us

I sleep like a baby through the night
Maybe it helps to know
You'll be there tomorrow
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)

I'll wake from the spell I'm under
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)
I could live without you now.

And what about the laughter
The happy ever after?
Like voices of sweet angels
Calling out our names

And it's not just wishful thinking

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of

All my life, I have dreamed of this
But I could not see your face

Can fall right into place.

That I can hear

How do I learn
To give and love and be loved in return
If this is heaven I'm falling
I'd rather run and jump away
Than to see it burn
I feel I could die
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek
And say goodbye

I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again, and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
Wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
Doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely gray,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, ha!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,2004

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

You are through

Good luck

It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night
Once it's said, you are dead
You will get the worst reviews
You've ever read

Good luck

Even at the Comedie-Francaise
On the opening night they are scared
""Bon chance, mes amis,"" no one says
The only word you ever hear is
Merde

Good luck, good luck, good luck

It's verboten, wishing luck on opening night
Take advice, don't think twice
Or your show will surely end
Up in the Scheiss

Guten lucken

At the famous La Scala in Milan
On opening night it's a rule
In Boccu Lupa they say with Elan
And just for luck they all shout
""Bah fongool""

I got it, now I'll never say
""Good luck"" on opening night
That's the rule, I'm no fool
What do I say, I beg?

What you say is,
""Break a leg""
Break a leg?
Yes, break a leg

If you're clever
Good luck
You'll endeavor
To never, never, never, never
Ever, ever, ever say
On opening night

Brad Paisley,"West Texas forecast more of the same
Sunny and mild with no chance of rain
That old John Deere tractor ain't moved in days
Oh but he's out there climbin' back on
'Cause he's yet to admit that his crops are all gone

She stares out the window fightin' back tears
And watches him wastin' his time in the fields
They're havin' problems payin' the bills
And she knows that it won't be long
Before the bank finally places a lien on the farm

And the tractor keeps rolling
The dust rises high
Creating the only cloud in the sky
He's holding his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust

Yesterday somethin' in town caught his eye
The old hardware store had a help wanted sign
He thought about stoppin' but he drove on by
'Cause he just can't bear to let go
After all it's the only life he's ever known

And the tractor keeps rolling
The dust rises high
Creating the only cloud in the sky
He's holding his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust",Cloud of Dust,1999
Brad Paisley,"Oh yeah, sure, no problem
I?ll just throw away these feelings
Let go of all these hopes
And never think of you

No offense, but you've lost it
If you think I'll just forget you
And decide that I don't love you
Do you realize what you're tellin' me to do

It's like sayin' don't breathe
Or don't blink
Darlin' I don't think you understand
See, I can't just turn this off
It's like sayin' don't eat
Or don't sleep
Our love's just one of those things
That I've gotten used to doin' way too long

You don't have to worry
I'm not gonna stop you
You can pack up all your things
And head on out that door

But don't stand there and tell me
How you think it would be best
To leave my feelings in the past
And not allow myself to love you anymore

Brad Paisley,"When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feeling more like a job interview
My mama used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes

And then all of a sudden ah it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

I met the girl who's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

And then all of a sudden ah it seemed so strange to me
How we had gone from something's missing to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standing next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me

They're just tiny little rumors
That I started 'cause I'm lookin' out for you
Ah settle down, I'm just a little jealous

That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive

Oh, my granddad's dad walked down
Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won't you walk with me out of the mouth
Of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
Till a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills he said I'll pay ya for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive

Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west
Of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive

But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling
And ole granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinking
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

Episode two, 
The continuing adventures of the Kung Pao buckaroos.

The three cowboys needed a place to bed down for the night.
So I suggested the establishment of Miss Kitty May,
(Or she may not).
A former love and a woman of questionable repute.

So they walked into the saloon and asked for Miss Kitty.
And just then, they heard a voice saying,
""Hi, boys. You lookin' for these.""
And the littlest cowboy turned around to see two huge 38s pointed right at his face.
(Jimmy, you can't say that!)
(What? She had huge guns.)
Smith and Wesson revolvers.
Oh boy, were they loaded.
(Oh brother)

Not you, Jimmy. You stand up normal.

They dropped the money they owed her, an' she bent over to pick it up,
And, oh, that moon was beautiful.

Out the window. I couldn't see it till then George:
There were mountains in the way.

I think he's got a little thing for her, George.
It's not THAT little.
(That was worth the trip over here.)
All, right, Jimmy, let's get serious now.

So the little cowboy was tryin' not to act too excited.
But when I look at a woman that beautiful, it's hard.
(Jimmy!!!).
What? It's very difficult.
I hope they're not recordin' this.
Yeah.
Ah.

Brad Paisley,"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks.
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling
Of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
Home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
You'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day",Silver Bells,2006
Brad Paisley,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Brad Paisley,"When you're feeling lonely, lost and let down
Seems like those dark skies are following you around
And life's just one big shade of gray
You wonder if you'll see the light of day

Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds

I've heard it said that this too shall pass
Good times or bad times, neither one lasts
But thinking that your luck won't ever change
Is like thinking it won't ever stop once it starts to rain

Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
Yeah, there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds","Behind the Clouds, song",2006

In some far off place
And it causes you
To rethink some things
You start to sense
That slowly you're becoming someone else
And then you find yourself

When you make new friends
In a brand new town
And you start to think
About settling down
The things that would have been lost on you
Are now clear as a bell
And you find yourself
That's when you find yourself

Well you go through life
So sure of where you're heading
And you wind up lost
And it's the best thing that could happen
‘Cause sometimes when you lose your way
It's really just as well
‘Cause you find yourself
That when you find yourself

When you meet the one
You've been waiting for
And she's everything
That you want and more
You look at her
And you finally start
To live for someone else

That's when you find yourself

So sure of where we're heading

I can make you new friends

For your best man's emberrasing speech

Is it like too Republican or too Democrat
Is it too far to the left 
Too far to the right
Too straight down the middle
Is it too black or too white

Is the gravy too thick are the peas too black-eyed
Is the iced tea too sweet does it have too much tang
Are there too many lemons in mama's lemon meringue

Too country what's that
It is too many pearls of wisdom under grandpa's old hat
Is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique
Is the question too strong or the answer too weak

Are the roses too red is the sunshine too bright
Are there too many stars in the heavens at night
Are there too many fish that still jump in the stream
Is the blue sky too blue is the clean air too clean

Is the grace too amazing is the steeple too tall
Are there too many ""yes sir's"", ""yes ma'am's""

Do the fiddle and steel remind you too much of home

Being a celebrity

I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way

To look at us on paper
I would have to agree
It could have been the moon light
Or it could have been the wine
But the way that we were acting
Hell it could have been the moon shine

And oh we're do we go from here
I don't know
But baby one thing's clear
Some mistakes are too much fun
To only make once

There's this little straight stretch
Just south of here
It's great for mashing down the gas
And trying out fifth gear
But it's also a speed trap
Twice I've gotten caught
But something bout it calls to me
And I can't seem to stop

And oh you have the same effect
I know I'll just keep coming back
Some mistakes are too much fun
To only make once

Well there are things in life that I regret
And even more that haven't happened yet
But it would be a shame if our little fling
Always stayed a onetime thing

Someday if we're lucky
We'll get old enough to finally be embarrassed
By the crazy things we've done
Be just like our parents

Looking out the window I think about how I got here today
Anyone who's anywhere had some help getting there its true
And one of the reasons why I get to do the things I do

I met this angel
With callused hands
Who led this boy to his band
Under his wing I learned to fly
On these six strings through this life
You can hear them in my playing
Although he's gone
And I owe him so much more than just this song

Like a leaf that had fallen I was drifting down the stream
Mr. Guitar came into my life and let me live this dream
His old Gretch still speaking still speaking its teaching all of us a ton
He was my friend and my hero all wrapped up in one

I met this angel
With callused hands
Who lead this naive boy into his band
Under his wing I learned to fly
On his six strings into the night
I can still hear him playing although he's gone

Brad Paisley,"On my fifth birthday, I got so upset,
About the brand new bike, that I didn't get.
I'd prayed my heart out, and it didn't seem fair,
I told my grandpa, I guess God doesn't care,
And he just smiled, and said my child,

Make no mistake, every prayer you pray,
Gets answered, even though,
Sometimes, the answer is no.

Five years later, out behind the shed,
With a stolen pack of grandpa's cigarettes,
I struck a match, and held that first one to my lips,
And prayed to God please let me get away with this,
And through the smoke, I saw grandpa standing there.

Make no mistake, every prayer you pray,
Gets answered, even though,
Sometimes, the answer is no.

When I think of all the answers in my life, I would have to say,
There's no doubt it was always for the best,
When I didn't get my way.

Grandpa got older, like grandpas do,
His health was failing, and I guess I knew,
It'd be best if he was called on hold,
But selfishly I prayed that God would keep him hanging on,
And when he passed away, in my mind I heard him say.

Make no mistake, every prayer you pray,
Gets answered, even though,
Sometimes, the answer is no.

Sometimes, the answer,
Is no.",No,2009

And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday

She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother

She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

[Chorus]

She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me

Every day that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah, she's everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me",She's Everything [Live],2010

You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later, in the front porch light
Taking forty-five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
But I thought I loved you then

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl
Like a river meets the sea,
Stronger than it's ever been.
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

And I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you,
You were so surprised
There were people around, but I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there and once again,
I thought I loved you then

But now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe, the way I feel about you, girl
Like a river meets the sea,
Stronger than it's ever been.
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

And I can just see you, with a baby on the way
And I can just see you, when your hair is turning gray
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl
We'll look back someday, at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then

Brad Paisley,"Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman?

I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said, son, since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
She came down the stairs at eight-thirty

She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son, she sure looked pretty

Yeah, she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman
He said the wedding took a year to plan

You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do

And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman
And I don't guess we've been anywhere

She hasn't made us late, I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy, it's just a fact of life

It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well gon' on and get used to it
She'll take her time, 'cause you don't mind

Waitin' on a woman
I've read somewhere, statistics show
The man's always the first to go

And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side

I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind

To the car parked by the curb
Gassed up for Gatlinburg
A little chapel and a couple of rings
Will get you two toothbrushes by the bathroom sink

Starts out as a little thing
Just needs a little time and room to grow
Step by step, day by day
It all adds up along the way

A corner lot on the edge of town
A weed eater and a picket fence
You think it's good as the getting gets
Then she wakes up feeling bad
You both wonder what's up with that

Starts out as a little thing
Just needs a little time and room to grow
Step by step, day by day

Oh, Dixie Land,
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I been away, way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my Southern Comfort zone

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me,
To take a good hard look around and be in the minority

And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my Southern Comfort zone

Brad Paisley,"To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main, I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ‘ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn but from my point of view

I'm just a white man comin' to you from the southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still pickin' up the pieces, walkin' on eggshells, fightin' over yesterday
And caught between southern pride and southern blame

They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

‘Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for the mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught between southern pride and southern blame

Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're livin' in the hood
Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodgin' invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinkin' it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judgin' the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be

I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride

First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
And I can just feel it, I'm slipping away
And babe, I can already say that

As long as I live, whatever I do
As great as it is you know what's a bummer
I ain't never gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste in your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and putting up tops
Be a cold wind blowing and leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere
Maybe I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in
Knowing it's all gonna end

As long as I live, whatever I do
As great as it is you know what's a bummer
I ain't never gonna beat this summer with you

And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell

As long as I live, whatever I do
As great as it is you know what's a bummer

It’s poker night and there’s one empty chair
So many things we’re gonna miss

How she treated him for years.

When he lost his life.

Because those five minutes were heaven.
A peace unlike he'd ever known.

So she goes through the drive-thru and keeps her sunglasses on

But now she’s had enough, and the battle lines are drawn

He’s in a bar chasing Cuervo with Tecate
He doesn’t know she’s been taking karate
The way she figures it about July
She’ll finally have the belt to match her eye

She’s on a mission as the months pass
Five days a week and never misses a class
And now she’s up to breakin’ boards and concrete blocks

He doesn’t know she’s been taking karate
Now here it is just about July
She’s gonna get that belt to match her eye

He stumbled through the door tonight
And started treatin’ her rough
Well, she took one look at him and her training kicked in
And she’d finally had enough

He threw a punch, she spun around
Grabbed his arm and put him on the ground
Grabbed a cuttin’ board on his way down and she kicked it in half
His knees hit the floor, his chin hit a chair
Knocked out his tooth and it flew through the air
Grabbed his head by the back of his hair and slammed him into the fridge
She landed a left, a right and then a left
She landed a roundhouse right in his chest and a scissor punch upside his head
Broke his nose, swept a leg, he started to fall
And on his way down, she took a bow, and the lights went out

He’s on the floor like he went a round with Rocky
He didn’t know she’d been taking karate

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me,
To take a good hard look around and be in the minority

And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my Southern Comfort zone

I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White

I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
'Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back

When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away, way too long
I can't see this world unless I go

I guess I've been in a dry spell,

She shakes her head and
Looks at you and says, ""ain't you good for anything""
And you say,

You want a margarita
I'll get tequila and ice

I can stomp it with my boot,
Crunch it with my fist,
Smash it on my forehead, yeah
I got this
I'll be crushin' it
Oh, I'll be crushin' it, ooh

I figured this out in college
Walking past them gothic colums
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere, near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around,
But like the great George freakin' Straight
I'm the king of getting unwound

Brad Paisley,"I can still remember when
Grandpa died and our ship came in
Daddy said he left momma and him more money than we'd ever seen
And just like that we were thousandaires
Had a brand new boat and a Frigidaire
And all us kids in our underwear were jumping on a trampoline

A bunch low lives living the high life
Money burning a hole right through the pockets of holey jeans
Grandpa's with Lord now, but we got a new Ford now
And we can watch the Big Orange now on a 57 inch TV, that's right

Money was gone by mid-July and we went back to just getting by
'Til momma slipped on a patch of ice outside of Chick-Fil-A
Now we knew they was a Christian bunch
So we didn't ask for all that much
Settled out of court for ten thousand bucks
And free chicken 'til I die a day

A bunch low lives living the high life
Money burning a hole right through the pockets of holey jeans
Momma's got a limp now but we all get to swim now
'Cause we got an above ground sitting out by the trampoline

We rocked, we rolled, we lived it up 'til it started running thin
We began looking for a way to spend that will again

I heard a song a couple months ago, was Carrie Underwood on the radio
Reminded me of a poem my brother wrote back in second grade
I know she didn't steal it but so what? We lawyered up and we sued her butt
These days we figured we'd pretty much get paid to go away

A bunch low lives living the high life
Money burning a hole right through the pockets of a holey jeans
This song's another one now, know I get a hot tub now
Set it next to the above ground, which is next to the trampoline

It's gonna run out some day
And that ain't gonna be a fun day
But as long as it ain't a Sunday
We can go to Chick-Fil-A and eat

Man I love those Waffle fries (I know)
That Chick-Fil-A has got some good waffle fries (I'd say, that's right)
Maybe I'll get a diet Coke,
I don't know (I wish they had beer, it'd be perfect)
I like the little trays that the food comes on (I like the Polynesian sauce)",High Life,2014
Brad Paisley,"Ain't gotta have everything in your life
Goin' exactly right, to party!
Maybe the opposite things are a mess
And that's the best time to burn it down!
You look around here and you see all these people
You think their lives are perfect, ha, hardly
Now I don't have all the answers
But I'll tell you the one thing I've found

You take it all with a grain of salt
And realize sometimes it ain't your fault
You got something you don't wanna remember
That's when you need to just throw it in a blender
And have a good time
Now add tequila!
When life gives you limes
You make margaritas!

Now I don't know if you're the type
That sees the glass as half full or half empty
I got an idea, how 'bout I never let ya get that low
Whatever is done is done, the night is young
Let's have some fun, are you with me?
Try to forget the sh*t that hit the fan
The only way that I know

Need your glass of wine topped off

Do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
A girl like you can do anything
But anything you don’t wanna do

Get all made up, wonder how you look
Make your own breakfast, make the first move
Feel like you ain’t being listened to
Kill your own spiders, change a flat tire
Stoke your own fire, mow your own grass
Pump your own gas, ever feel pain
Wish you had a ring on your hand

In the background there's a toddler, cryin' on the toilet seat

You oughta be ashamed, of your selfie
Now why you gotta go and tweet it?
When you really oughta just delete it
Now we all want to unsee it but we can't
You oughta be ashamed (but you're not)

Spring Breakin' in Daytona, in the middle of a keg stand
It's all fun and games 'til your daddy follows you on Instagram
You oughta be ashamed (that's right) of your selfie, (the Internet is forever)

You oughta take that stick and break it in half
Show a little sense, show a little class
You took it of your face but you know you're really showing your ass

Go on and take one at the Grand Canyon
Or if you get to meet Ringo Starr
But if you're texting some girl that you just met
Pictures of your little Brett Favre

I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like

Brad Williams,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

You think you're in your darkest hour
When the lights are coming on in the house of love

Oh, house of love

You've been up all night
Thinking it was over
He's been out of sight
At least for the moment
But when something this strong

It's got a hold on him too

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,2006

Bradley Walker,"It was all that she left him, the night that she left him
So he clung to her memory with all of his might
He carried it with him everywhere he went
Like a soldier who just couldn't give up the fight

He took it to work, and he brought it back home
He took it so hard, couldn't leave it alone
We all called him crazy in our little town
The way that he carried her memory around

He boxed it up when he sold their old house
It rode right beside him there in the front seat
He littered his new place with those same old heartaches
It felt right at home there with her memory

He took it to church with him three times a week
He took it to bed when he laid down to sleep
The weight of remembering just wore him down
The longer he carried her memory around

When she never came back, he gave up on Jesus
And he never darkened another church door
He took up with whiskey, and he took up with women
'Till one night he just couldn't take anymore

He cried, ""God forgive me, but I've lost my will""
As he reached for that cold empty piece of blue steel
Then he put another big hole in his heart
The night that he carried her memory too far",He Carried Her Memory,2006

Bradley Walker,"Eighth avenue and Broadway
Cussin' at the light
Wrapped up in my existence
My perfect little life
When he tapped on my window
It scared me half to death
And even through the glass I swore
I smelled the whiskey on his breath.

I turned back and starred straight ahead
Wishing I could drive away
And just before the light turned green
I heard the old man say
I'm awful cold and hungry
Not a nickel to my name
Mister could you spare a little change

As I sped away in anger
Saw his sadness in the mirror
It haunted me for miles and miles 
Just wouldn't disappear
That moment of reflection
Pulled my conscience off the shelf
And the question crossed my mind
Was I looking at myself

I pulled over on the shoulder 
Finally broke down
Surrendered to emotion
As my knees hit the ground
I looked up to heaven
And cried in Jesus name
Father could you spare a little change

Could you make me a better man 
For my children and my wife
Don't let me take for granted
All the blessings of my life
Please forgive me lord I've lost my way
And turned my back on you
Perhaps its time I walked a mile
In someone else's shoes

Much stranger than fiction
The truth can open up your eyes
Angels walk among us
In every shape and size
Might be a bum on Broadway
That God sends to explain
Maybe your the one who needs the change
We all could use a little change

Brady Seals,"Well, my head starts sinkin' when you walk out that door
My mind gets worried and I walk the floor
I start missin' you baby a little more than I should
I guess I love you too much, too much for my own good

I'm like a lost soul driftin' on a deep dark sea
When ever you ain't here with me
If I could spend every minute with of the day with you baby I would
'Cause I love you too much, too much for my own good

Well, I hate to admit it but I do suspect
I'm just a love struck fool and a nervous wreck
It ain't like me to be uncool this way
But that's the way it's been since the very first day

Girl half the time you don't even treat me right
Tell me little lies and stay out all night
I'd probably say goodbye and leave you baby if I could
(Yes I would)
But I love you too much, too much for my own good

Brady Watt,"You gotta love it
Look around you, nobody quite do it like we does it
And nah, we don't need no labels to supply the budget
Haters should stop it, the angels guide us like God is hovered
Uh, you gotta love it
All we need to keep this shit goin's the soul of Guru
The black ice in the Rollie lookin' like a frozen Yoo-hoo
Now who knew a nigga like me was fit for rock and roll
You went against me, you lose, now sit and watch the show
Like Hulu, I used to dream about leavin' the block
Off honest MCin', man, fuck all this drama I'm seein'
Believe it or not, the scoundrels, skeezers and thots
It all goes down in the DM, even your stock
You gotta love it, bitches after me, hassle me by the dozen
If she can't have me, she ask do I got a brother
I'm pretty so niggas judge me as if I'm not as gutter
But if I feel threatened I'ma definitely make a promise of it
I don't need nothin', Preme it's time to cut it
But nowadays I be pressed for time 'cause I'm climbin' up this
Ladder, I started my company, now I'm signin' others
To remind me of when y'all ain't want me, you gotta love it

You ain't got to like it, spit it out after you bite it
Won't stand near me wishing that lightning would strike it
But you've gotta love it
Love it
You can't just ignore it, try to get medicine for it
But admit it, it's a very catchy chorus
And you've gotta love it
Oh, love it

And it's all for hip-hop, and we all together
I'm in Brooklyn with Talib in the book store
With Macklemore in the thrift shop
And I'm sober, yes, success the only thing causes this high
The rise and fall of the good guy, slash good fly
Man you've gotta love this shit
Man I'm just out here tryna follow my dreams, fool
I'm just out here inside of my olive-green coupe
I'm just out here with the next top model tryna swallow my gene pool
My entire gene pool
We under fire, it's time to get rid of the tension between you
And I, and unify, even if we ain't cool
Shit, it's 'bout love at this point
What's the use of thugs and drugs at this point?
It's just them killin' us and us killin' us at this point, hmm
And it was over nothin', just ran him down and slugged him
I'm goin' out on a limb, tell Danny Brown I love him
Big Sean, I'm behind you, no matter what you do
They gon' have to fuck with me if they decide to fuck with you
Prolly wouldn't have survived the business if it wasn't for Kino
Shout out to Ro and Rick, Dro and Sino
Clear Soul Forces, shout out to Nolan and Ninch
Here to get paid, not owe, but to get Os to go in the end
Shout out to Fat 5 and Marv 1, Porter, Twin
Shout out to Tricky, Dove, Oba Rowland
D Twizzy, Deezy and Dub
If anybody sees Obie Trice, make sure you let him know that when he sees me, it's love
I learned early, never go to sleep with a grudge
And how easy it is to speak things into the streets and some blood
Shout out to Roc, Tiara, I know your career's gon' see numbers right out the box
Right on, shout out to Flomps
Me and Denaun, wish there was more time to fly out and bond
But, maybe some other time
I just need to make sure that my mother's fine
I just need to make sure my baby stay rich
Not poor, stay spore, stay color blind
Love, love
And if you comin' at me with hate, you can't have my rebuttal
I'm too busy makin' sure Ashley straight
I just need to make sure I keep my nigga Chav out of trouble
I just pray that Icewear Vezzo and Peezy stay in them dopeboy rocks
DBCO and dopeboy drops in memory of Dopeboy Rock
Been payin' my dues so long feel like niggas owe me
Get Nas on the phone, how can I help out with my nigga Bodie?

this is one shot, headed for Goliath (I can't miss)
target practice on topics, flipping rhymes off the top
waiting for this one chance to throw my rock (rock on)
the least expected to defeat the beast
judgements passed to blast my confidence, I won't surrender or retreat
return my gifts to the sender, this is worship in the chaos
this is heavy concentration (got my game face on)
an eruption of noise flooding from a mouth of silence
I'm nobody, a spec of dust battling a giant
he stands and mocks me, everyone things I'm crazy
laughing as if I'm not aware of who I'm facing

Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
you can't hold me down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant
Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
you can't hold us down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant

And his shadow covers the country side, we're dwelling in the darkness
running away, while he's running things
calling shots, got us locked in bondage
his threats hold us hostage, afraid to be free from his grip
I can't hold my tongue, I'm holding this stone
hands sweaty and callus, mentally un-balanced, I'm ready for the challenge
seen many before me back down and crack under pressure
it's time to take drastic measure, let it loose
intimidation factor tries to set in, I'm grab my weapon
not arrogant, but it's apparent that he's feeling threatened
I'm stepping in his direction, the point of no return
with every action backed by the power of words

Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
you can't hold me down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant
Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
you can't hold us down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant

My armor is weak, I don't expect to be hit at all
I'm entering, knowing I'm protected (he can't touch me)
mental simulations, got me picturing victory
he's snickering and slithering, I'm setting him strait
full speed ahead, he's surprised by my approach
probably thinking I'ma try and swing a sword to his throat
but I go for what I know, throw a stone with precision
accurate and cracking his skull, when it hits it
he's tripping, he's shaking, I'm taking him out
and before he could react he fell flat on the ground
the whole earth shook, I returned to finish him
chopped of his head and carried it through the villages
the city people cheered, I delivered a speech
they all danced in the streets celebrating his defeat
I said, he was dead, before the battle started
to take him out you just gotta aim for the right target",Goliath,2004
Braille,"Letting go, of something that you hold close
why you let it stay around, you just don't know, say
Let it Go
Let it Go
Letting go, of something that you hold close
tried to make it work out, but it won't, say
Let it Go
Let it Go

I gotta let this go, once and for all, I'm one voice
speaking in-between the pauses, waiting for my time
is it right now or has it passed me by, I magnify
the situation through my glass eye and analyze it
what's real and what's fake? It's blown out of proportion
all the voices in my head sound distorted (do the right thing)
and muffled, I'm stretching my faith muscle, this rap game's a hustle
a struggle to stay humble and trust
big trouble, in little me, causing complications
I run from confrontation, observations made from a distance
my defense to resist, I'm not convinced
that all my silhouettes can co-exist, so I drift
into the clouds of God's grace and freedom, feeling like these feelings
is filling me, with pride and negativity I don't need
and even though at times I felt stepped on
and taken for granted, it's time to heal from the damage

Letting go, of something that you hold close
why you let it stay around, you just don't know, say

Braille,"Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul
Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul, let me hear you say
Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul
Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul

The Soul Rock soldier, rock solid sonic Solomon
Rock in Sodom and Gomorah, souls tortured, sin abolishes
society, the beats and rhymes bring the balance back
I swing a battle axe, attack accurate, lyrical tactics
take flight over the badlands, bad habits reign supreme
battered and bruised, confused with shattered dreams
it's time to change the scene, full swing, drums harder to hit ya
get a ticket for the show, your missing the big picture
dis-figured images, deception dominates the premises
it's war, but who's the enemy? Who's the nemesis?
Pessimistic perceptions spread spiritual pestilence
(soul rock) not just to entertain but also for your soul's benefit",Soul Rock,2004

Braily Ramos,"Me odio por tanto quererte
Me castigas cuando estoy sin verte
Solamente de imaginarte
Yo me muero por acariciarte

Sentir tu boca besar la mía
Por eso a todo yo me amiesgaría
Estoy pensando de noche why día
Por tenerte todo lo daría

Te llevo en mi sangre, no puedo engañarme
Con cada latido te quiero más why más
Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar

No pensé que me enamoraría
Pero tus ojos fueron brujería
Me cumpliste una profecía
Why desbordaste un corazón que estaba en sequía

Me odio por tanto quererte
Me vuelvo loca si fuera a perderte
Why aunque este amor no lo cambiaría
Como yo te quiero a ti es una agonía

Te llevo en mi sangre, no puedo engañarme
Con cada latido te quiero más why más

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar
Será que solo vivo pa' quererte
Me muero si no pudiera tenerte

Te llevo en mi sangre, no puedo engañarme
Con cada latído te quiero más why más
Tus ojos fueron brujería
Noche a noche, día a día

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar
Me odio por tanto quererte
",Me Odio,2007
