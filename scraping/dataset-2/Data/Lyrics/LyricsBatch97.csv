Daft Punk,"Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh, let it pass me by

I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh let it pass me by

I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me

Daft Punk,"Yeah, uh

Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

You are not the single type
So baby, this the perfect time
I'm just trying to get you high
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So baby, I can make it right
You just got to let me try
To give you what you want

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

DAG,"Tried to make it alone
Didn't get me too much
You can cover your past
Not forgotten at last
Everything that you feel is mine
And the field still holds your sway
I see you in the pouring wine
When the darkness gets pulled away
You make me feel like I'm real
You make it summer all the time
You make me feel like I'm real
You make the raindrops shine like dimes
You make me feel like I'm real
You make it summer you make it good
Well it goes to show that you never know
I can take you to task
But you don't want me to ask
Time will stop like a click
But we're both gonna go
If in time you are flying high
Over fields where we would play
I'd be the colors in your kite
And the strings that hold you safe
And in time we are flying high
As we dance in the headlights laughing
Tears are all spilled behind us
And the bad days have blown away
",You Make Me Feel,1998
Dag Jones,"Where they at?

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Hey, must be the money!",Ride Wit Me,2003

In over his head again
Silly boy

Behind us, the lying and hiding",What Now?,1986
Dag Nasty,"I'm irresponsible
I'm irrational
What are you gonna do?
And if it's in my head
And if I'm just paranoid
Well I guess it's just jealousy
When it comes to you
But you'll never guess
It's like exercising
When I try to disguise it
I avoid your eyes
You'll never know
Inside I can't stand it at all
When every word is a lie
But I go through it all
Lies are just exercises
And I can't help myself
Cause I've always lied to myself
I've had to fake so many things
What are you gonna do?
And if you see though it all
And I can't excuse myself
I think I need your help to see me through
What are you gonna do?
Lies are just exercises",Exercise,1987
Dag Nasty,"The last time I spoke to you
I was seconds away
From losing my face
But I'm much closer now, we're so much closer now
And I haven't stopped laughing since I
Learned to laugh at myself
When I fall down, and I'm much farther down
We're so much closer now that
You're mine
To have and to hold until the end of time

You're mine, you're mine
""I'm so tired of being alone"" she said
""I don't want to go back home - where the heart is""
And I feel like trash
The closer I get to you
But I can't turn my eyes away
The closer I get to you

Until the end of time
You're mine, you're mine",You're Mine,1988
Dag Nasty,"I wouldn't speak my mind
I didn't want to make them mad
I looked up to them
For the courage I thought I didn't have
I never bothered to lift a finger to make my point
Now I'm spelling it out
And nobody's listening
It's hard to take it to heart
It hurts to be apart
But I can't watch and not be heard
The days go by and things get worse
But they say they can only get better
I try to make a dent
But it blends in with all the damage
I try to look the other way
But there's a mirror behind me
I see images of what can be done
It seems like I'm the only one
I wouldn't speak my mind",Circles,1991
Dag Nasty,"I can last a lifetime
Or be done with in a day
I can be picked up
I can be thrown away

I'm supposed to bounce back
I am a rubber ball
Hope that I can bounce back after each and every fall
But it's easier to fall
I'm supposed to bounce back
I can't hit you hard enough to make you feel you're not alone
I can't touch you soft enough to make you feel you're flesh and bone

Nothing for one
And the more on your side
The better for them

I don't understand
And I can't accept that you feel safer blending in with the rest
And it think it's sad
That I should have to ask
Am I safe?
If I don't want to be with you
Did your new friends take the time to tell you what they're trying to prove
For the first time in your life people are afraid of you

But the answer`s not in your basement

This time - down time
Your cover`s blown you`re on your own this time
Down time now you`re on your own
Look around - up and down

There are people sleeping on the ground
There are problems way more real
Than a gang or a scene or a record deal
And I don`t believe it

Ten more minutes and I can breathe again

But I just can't seem to find them anywhere
See I've been hoping for
No war, no crime, all the people on the street have a place to sleep at night

You can't believe everything you read
Maybe what I'm looking for is inside of me
And I've been hoping that
Everybody's color blind - white pride, black pride, no one has to take a side
Just looking for the answers to a prayer
And if I can make it happen well, you know I will
I think we could make a difference still
Just looking for the answers to to our prayers

Who's staring at me?
Reflections showing everything but the pain that's underneath
I turn around and walk away but the images stay in my mind

Wish I could see through all this doubt
And if I had a million days
Would I find what I'm looking for?
Who I'm looking for?
If I had a million days

Sometimes I just feel angry

It`s a sound that`s inside us for so long
And it means more to me than it will to you

And I'm still here
I've got nothing but time

So I'm still waiting
Yeah I'm still waiting

I couldn't wait until I could drive

Dag Nasty,"He looks back to the days when the lyrics and chords meant everything
These days he stares at the screen so complacent and without dreams
Change, but he can't hide it that's the story of an average man
He needs goods and services for which he pays a premium
Just a display for his neighbors dot-comers who earned a fortune
Change, but we can't hide it that's the story of an average man
Take us to our cubicles today
And it's the hell we make o.k. 
Nobody cares, nobody cares, no one cares about the average man
Burnt toast at 6 a.m. it's not gourmet, but it's adequate 
Waste away precious hours in front of the flat screen monitor
Change, but you can't hide it - that's the story of an average man
Take us to our cubicles today
And it's the hell we make o.k. 
Nobody cares, nobody cares, no one cares about the average man
Just when you think you've got everything you've got nothing at all
Take us to our cubicles today
Take us to our cubicles today
Take us to the hell we made
Take us to the hell we made
Can we escape? can we escape? 
How can we escape the hell we've made?
Can we escape? can we escape?
Everyday there's something new it just goes on and on 
I try to take a different view still I'm doing something wrong 
Burning but I hesitate to burn this final bridge 
Yearning for a better way to say 'to hell with this'
I'm twisted again
Doubled in pain
A shell of myself is all that will remain
Bills spilling out onto the floor welcome to life my friend 
Working but there's so many more will this shit never end?
Too much responsibility I just can't take much more 
And when you act so cold it just points me to that door

I'm twisted again
Doubled in pain
A shell of myself is all that will remain",Average Man,2002
Dag Nasty,"Now you really should be above all this 
But in fact I can't avoid your Judas kiss 
And I keep turning the other cheek for you to slap me down
It hurts when the knife's in deep, but I won't make a sound
Turn off the song of broken days
Burn through another masquerade
And I don't see it all as a blaze of glory
Fidelity is a timeless thing
I hold it dear it's what I'm offering
It's priceless like a matter of faith
Time to pass it on hold the light in the darkness until it's gone

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",My Lagan Love,2001

A bottle fallen
Don't you think of me

Some other hands
That made you melt

Oh, I can tell if the thing is wick
Wick, I've heard Ben's a wick

When a thing is wick, it has a life about it
Now, maybe not a life like you and me
But somewhere there's a single streak of green inside it
Come, and let me show you what I mean

When a thing is wick, it has a light around it
Maybe not a light that you can see
But hiding down below a spark's asleep inside it
Waiting for the right time to be seen

You clear away the dead parts
So the tender buds can form
Loosen up the earth and let the roots get warm
Let the roots get warm

Come a mild day, come a warm rain
Come a snowdrop, a comin' up
Come a lily, come a lilac
Come to call, callin' all of us to come and see

When a thing is wick
And someone cares about it
And comes to work each day
Like you and me
Will it grow?
It will
Then have no doubt about it
We'll have the grandest garden ever seen

Oh, Dickon, I want it all to be wick
Would you come and look at it with me?
I'll come every day, rain or shine if you want me
All that garden needs is for us to come wake it up
Dickon, what if we save the garden, then uncle
Archie takes it back, or Colin wants it?
What a miracle that would be, gettin' a poor
Crippled boy out to see his mother's garden

You give a living thing
A little chance to grow
That's how you will know
If she is wick, she'll grow
So grow to greet the morning
Leave the ground below
When a thing is wick
It has a will to grow and grow

Come a mild day, come a warm rain
Come a snowdrop, a-comin' up
Come a lily, come a lilac
Come to call, calling all the rest to come
Calling all of us to come
Calling all the world to come

Oh, somewhere there's single streak of green below
And all through the darkest nighttime
It's waiting for the right time
When a thing is wick, it will grow",Wick,1991

Alone, I'm like Capone movin' weight on ya block
We keep glocks cocked, lit daily, hop Chevy's and smoke heavy
Every night we got bitches shakin' ass in the telly
Drunk off Bailey's, we the shit, so fuck what ya tell me
I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit, you tryin' to sell me
On the low, like you niggas don't sound West Coast
But it sounds to me, like you niggas gossip like hoes
All on our dick, knowin' nobody could fuck wit this
Rappin' or scrappin', blastin' or jackin', who want action
At the vet who haven't lost his step yet, place ya bets

West Coast junkyard convict from darkness
Roll wit the heartless, murder you like an are'ist
Mean man hollow, the man who pain'ted flowers
String bloody teeth, then knock you over the towers
Medieval cathedral, dance out with the skeletons
Iron that veteran, heard of dead elephants
Trampled through ya grave site, fungus in ya ear hole
Blackboard jungle, humble, but watch my spear blow
Wu-Tang Clan, warriors on the hillside
Murder any M.C. sittin', dinin' wit the swells
Pearl handle cougar knife, baby pist' revolvers
Shoot my way out, and dead bodies clog the doorway
A la carte, more vay, I rhyme the best charm
Huffin' on a blunt, wit an anaconda for left arm

Off Henny, Remi and Phillies, smack sadiddy bitch silly

In public, she do it just because we Wu-Tang published

Corrupted in the slums where the average hustle for crumbs
Bustin' they guns, we lustin' for funds

Of this Killa Bee Gang, bangin' Six Mill beats

Blue dickie coats, chokin' on that Andy smoke

Street raps blow off ya knee caps for street scraps
In my hood, we all perform magic, cheat death, take a deep breath
Lace up ya boots, cock and shoot
Let it penetrate, just a little way gangstas communicate

Who to say the Knights ain't shit, niggas get blew away
It's obvious we too much, fuck the such and such
Ya click can't rough, tough, low down and dangerous

Pass it around, let it rotate, that's on the eight

But something got away, I guess
In the everyday of our lives
And I don't know what keeps us here

We can runaway
Baby come as you are
You can look at my heart
As your getaway car
We can drive all night
It'll be alright
Love can take us so far
In my getaway car

All we need is the open road
More fuel for the fire inside us
Steer us on into lands unknown
We can leave this world behind us
All I know is you and me
That's all we'll need to start all over again

Get us out of this town

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Everybody's somebody's plaything

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.

I'll admit I was short on luck
You were bright, like a new day
All my troubles, went away

And in every way, i know you still want to stay

There is no other voice
I want to hear but yours

In a dream that I had
I was cruel, I was truly mad
I woke up filled with fear
I went away, 'cause you were near

But in every way you know I just want you to say
Beats something else, you know I never think about myself
And in every way, I know that you still want to stay
And that's got to be, because I never even think of making it
In every way, you know I just want you to stay

Those devil lips that know so well the art of lying
And though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
Can't you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou

Will they gather the crumbs around our door
Will they fly from the nest to the top of the tree
And ask why Joe wanders out no more

What will the kitten do, mother, all alone
Will she stray from her frolic for a day
Will she lie on the rug beside my bed 
Like she did before I went away

What will Thomas, the old gardener do 
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
The fairest one that lies around the tree

I saw the tears coming to his honest eyes
He said it was the wind that brought 'em there
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day
His hand trembled over my hair

Keep Tag, mother, my little dog 
I know that he'll mourn for me too
Keep him though blind and older he grows
To sleep in the whole summer through

Show him my coat, mother, so he may know
That his master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
And pat him on his brown shaggy head

And you, dearest mother, shall miss me for a while
But in heaven I shall no larger grow
And any kind angel you meet at the gate
Can take you to your darling Little Joe",Little Joe,1991

Dale Potter,"Where is the love that you promised 'neath the pine?
Gone like the flowers in the fall
You crossed your heart, now you're double crossing mine
You've been pretending after all

I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

I never dreamed that your love would grow so cold
Hiding behind the rainbow's end
You must be blind for the glitter of the gold
Gold that can never find a friend

I was sold down the river on the port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

You'll never know what it means to sit and cry
After your heart is broken too
Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die
When some one double crosses you

Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

 That my love will never die
 Someday I'll walk along beside her
 On that golden way up there

Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay

I wonder if you'll hold me then

We'll have life eternal there

And we sang our own love's refrain
And out hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything

Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
Yes time changes everything

The time has passed and I have forgot you
Mother nature does wonderful things
I guess it is true for me and for you
Cause time changes everything

Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you

Dale Turner,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

I won't leave here alone

She hit me hard took me right off guard

If I was a truckin' man


Now I can't let my life slip away

Pushin' these number two pencils everyday

This rat race don't fit into my plan, no ma'am

I'm dreamin', schemin', if I was a truckin' man


(Chorus:)

If I was a truckin' man

I'd be a gear jammer with a one-armed tan

I'd spend my nights in the roadhouse

Days on the lost highway

Hey, if I was a truckin' man

I'd have my radio screamin' on the AM band

All night drivin' by dashboard lights

If I was a truckin' man


(Guitar/Steel solos)


Well I'd sign my life away on the dotted white line

Drinkin' my coffee, smokin' my smokes all night

And if I get tired, I'll let Benny drive if he can

I'm dreamin', schemin', if I was a truckin' man


(Chorus:)

If I was a truckin' man

I'd be a gear jammer with a one-armed tan

I'd spend my nights in the roadhouse

Days on the lost highway

Hey, if I was a truckin' man

I'd have my radio screamin' on the AM band

All night drivin' by dashboard lights

If I was a truckin' man


",Truckin' Man,1996
Dale Watson,"Born like everyone with a slate as clean
Baby grew into a boy and started building steam
Boy learned how to blow it off in a dangerous kind of way
Well fellas here he comes that runaway train
Now hear his lonesome cry barrelin' down the track
Out of control his soul dressed in black
Sound to every man thats broken the chain
Rollin rollin rollin like a runaway train
It ain't easy to do your best when life comes at you fast
On his own so early on too young for such a task
Took the bull by the horn sometimes that bull was mean
And only at it stoking on that runaway train
Chorus
Married young and daddy soon his life was right on track
Something rumbled in his soul something that he lacked
He had to chase that melody that fueled a childhood dream
There ain't no holding back that runaway train
Chorus
Rollin rollin rollin like a runaway train
Hmmm I here that train a comin'
Hmmm Hey Porter Ohh Porter
Hmmm I don't care if I do da do",Truckstop in la Grange,1996
Dale Watson,"I woke up this morning;, my head was poundin'
I can't believe I let me do it again
I stayed out all night drinkin', what the hell must I thinkin'
Well I swore I'd never drink like that back then
Swear I'll never drink again, again

[Chorus]
Give me a hair of the dog that bit
Cause I heard somewhere it takes the bite away
Give me a hair of the dog that bit me
They tell me that it helps to ease the pain
I swear I'll never drink again, again

That's an old familiar story that I've told a thousand times
Somehow I just can't get it through my mind
But my mem'ry gets much clearer when I look into a mirror
After huggin' that cold porcelain oh so tight
Prayin' Jesus just get me through the night

[Chorus]",Hair of the Dog,1997
Dale Watson,"Misery and gin
Here I am drunk again
And gone gone gone
Man I hate these songs

Silver wings
And old lonesome memory
The music plays on
I hate these songs

[Chorus]
Cause I sit in my car
And I bathe in their sorrow
Try to wash away my pain
Just to get through tomorrow
Note by note
Line by line
It cuts to the bone
Man I hate these songs

Crazy four walls
He stopped loving her today
And old lonely street
Ain't it funny how time slips away

And born to loose
Am I losing you
I'm just hanging on
Man I hate these songs

Man I hate these songs",I Hate These Songs,1997
Dale Watson,"Drinking weren't allowed in the barn where we danced
But you could buy a coke at the store up front
The old man wore a path in that dirt road parking lot
From the back door of that barn to their trunk

That's the way it was on a Tennessee Saturday night
Just shooting the bull and dancing the night away
We sure had fun on a Tennessee Saturday night
Down at Jack's truck stop and cafe

It sure got hot in the sleepy southern town 
The night got as thick as the day
We'd open up them garage doors and we'd plug the shop fan in 
You could hear that band pickin' thirty blocks away

Come on, come on, come back

Now don't tell me that you're my child

Are your cute little ears turned down too quiet
I can see your smile's got a little bit wider

Babe, have you got it on?
Babe, have you got it on?
Come on, come on, come back
Babe, have you got it on?

I can see you heading for the north exchange
And I got to move to a south bound lane

Before I go ten ten let me tell you something

Dale Watson,"Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be,
Here is what Christmas time means to me.

City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
dressed in holiday style.
In the air there's
a feeling of Christmas.

Children laughing, people passing,
meeting smile after smile,
And on every street corner you'll hear:

Silver bells, silver bells,
It's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
soon it will be Christmas day.

City street lights,
even stop lights,
blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home
with their treasures.

Hear the snow crunch,
see the kids bunch,
This is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you'll hear:

Silver bells, silver bells,
It's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
soon it will be Christmas day.

At least now and then I get to hold you again

Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
They said the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
Tell me did you feel that?

Don't slow down
Even if it's only to escape
Just down, low down
Before somebody steals your place man

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out

When you love somebody

These fantasies are losing their grip
Between lips and close pressed finger tips
The song we sing is so nostalgic
Take me back to a time when I knew a little less,

But when your pride has all been spent
It's the beginning of the end
And it's sad but it is true
You put your own head in a noose

Se ti ho cercato per una vita senza trovarti
Senza nemmeno avere la soddisfazione di averti
Per vederti andare via

Quale allegria
Se non riesco neanche più a immaginarti
Senza sapere se strisciare se volare
Insomma, non so più dove cercarti

Quale allegria
Senza far finta di dormire
Con la tua guancia sulla mia
Saper invece che domani ciao come stai
Una pacca sulla spalla e via
Quale allegria

Quale allegria
Cambiar faccia cento volte per far finta di essere un bambino
Con un sorriso ospitale ridere cantare far casino
Insomma far finta che sia sempre un carnevale

Uscire presto la mattina
La testa piena di pensieri
Scansare macchine, giornali
Tornare in fretta a casa
Tanto oggi è come ieri

Anche sui treni e gli aeroplani
O sopra un palco illuminato
Fare un inchino a quelli che ti son davanti
E son in tanti e ti battono le mani

Senza allegria
A letto insieme senza pace
Senza più niente da inventare
Esser costretti a farsi anche del male
Per potersi con dolcezza perdonare
E continuare

Con allegria
Far finta che in fondo in tutto il mondo
C'è gente con gli stessi tuoi problemi
Per poi fondare un circolo serale
Per pazzi sprasolati e un poco scemi

Facendo finta che la gara sia
Arrivare in salute al gran finale
Mentre è già pronto Andrea
Con un bastone e cento denti
Che ti chiede di pagare

Anna permalosa
Anna bello sguardo
Sguardo che ogni giorno perde qualcosa
Se chiude gli occhi lei lo sa
Stella di periferia
Anna con le amiche
Anna che vorrebbe andar via

Marco grosse scarpe e poca carne
Marco cuore in allarme
Con sua madre e una sorella
Poca vita, sempre quella
Se chiude gli occhi lui lo sa
Lupo di periferia
Marco col branco

E la luna è una palla ed il cielo è un biliardo
Quante stelle nei flipper sono più di un miliardo
Marco è dentro a un bar
Non sa cosa farà
Poi c'è qualcuno che trova una moto, si può andare in cità

Anna bello sguardo non perde un ballo
Marco che a ballare sembra un cavallo
In un locale che è uno schifo
Poca gente che li guarda
C'è una checca che fa il tifo
Ma dimmi tu dove sarà
Dov'è la strada per le stelle
Mentre ballano si guardano e si scambiano la pelle
E cominciano a volare

Con tre salti sono fuori dal locale
Con un'aria da commedia americana
Sta finendo anche questa settimana
Ma l'America è lontana
Dall'altra parte della luna
Che li guarda e anche se ride
A vederla mette quasi paura

E la luna in silenzio ora si avvicina
Con un mucchio di stelle cade per strada
Luna che cammina
Luna di città
Poi passa un cane che sente qualcosa
Li guarda, abbaia e se ne va

E siccome sei molto lontano 
Più forte ti scriverò 

Da quando sei partito 
C'è una grossa novità
L'anno vecchio è finito ormai 
Ma qualcosa ancora qui non va

Si esce poco la sera 
Compreso quando è festa 
E c'è chi ha messo dei sacchi di sabbia vicino alla finestra
E si sta senza parlare per intere settimane 
E a quelli che hanno niente da dire del tempo ne rimane

Ma la televisione ha detto che il nuovo anno 
Porterà una trasformazione 
E tutti quanti stiamo già aspettando
Sarà tre volte Natale e festa tutto il giorno 
Ogni Cristo scenderà dalla croce 
E anche gli uccelli faranno ritorno

Ci sarà da mangiare e luce tutto l'anno 
Anche i muti potranno parlare 
Mentre i sordi già lo fanno

E si farà l'amore ognuno come gli va 
Anche i preti potranno sposarsi 
Ma soltanto a un a certa età
E senza grandi disturbi qualcuno sparirà
Saranno forse i troppi furbi 
E i cretini di ogni età

Vedi caro amico cosa ti scrivo e ti dico 
E come sono contento di essere qui in questo momento
Vedi, vedi, vedi, vedi
Vedi caro amico cosa si deve inventare

Dalia,"La settima luna
Era quella del luna-park
Lo scimmione si aggirava
Dalla giostra al bar
Mentre l'angelo di Dio bestemmiava
Facendo sforzi di petto
Grandi muscoli e poca carne
Povero angelo benedetto

La sesta luna
Era il cuore di un disgraziato
Che, maledetto il giorno che era nato
Ma rideva sempre
Da anni non vedeva le lenzuola
Con le mani sporche di carbone
Toccava il culo a una signora
E rideva e toccava
Sembrava lui il padrone

La quinta luna
Fece paura a tutti
Era la testa di un signore
Che con la morte vicino giocava a biliardino
Era grande ed elegante
Né giovane né vecchio
Forse malato
Sicuramente era malato
Perché perdeva sangue da un orecchio

La quarta luna
Era una fila di prigionieri
Che camminando
Seguivano le rotaie del treno
Avevano i piedi insanguinati
E le mani senza guanti
Ma non preoccupatevi
Il cielo è sereno
Oggi non ce ne sono più tanti

La terza luna
Uscirono tutti per guardarla
Era così grande
Che più di uno pensò al Padre Eterno
Sospesero i giochi e si spensero le luci
Cominciò l'inferno
La gente corse a casa perché per quella notte
Ritornò l'inverno

La seconda luna
Portò la disperazione tra gli zingari
Qualcuno addirittura si amputò un dito
Andarono in banca a fare qualche operazione
Ma che confusione
La maggior parte prese cani e figli
E corse alla stazione

L'ultima luna
La vide solo un bimbo appena nato
Aveva occhi tondi e neri e fondi
E non piangeva
Con grandi ali prese la luna tra le mani
E volò via e volò via
Era l'uomo di domani l'uomo di domani",L'Ultima Luna,1998

Io alle dieci avevo lezione di tango
Quanta brillantina e coraggio mi mettevo
Guarda oggi come piango

Hai più preso il treno
Quella donna che tangava con furore
Nei locali della croce rossa
Fuori era la guerra nel suo cuore
Nel suo cuore tanto tango
Da unire il cielo con la terra

Hai più preso il treno
Mi son guardato intorno
Ho viaggiato cento notti
Per arrivare di giorno
Ho letto libri antichi e preoccupanti
Poi arrivati a Torino
Ci siamo commossi in tanti
Per quel tango
Ballato dal bambino

Coltello fra i denti
Fiori in mano
Ballava con aria di questura
E l’occhio lontano
Stava per accadere il miracolo
Il cielo da nero a rosso
Ma il treno si è fermato lì
E non si è piu’ mosso

Hai più preso il treno
Ci siamo spinti senza avere fretta
Ci siamo urlati nell’orecchio
Senza darci retta
Mentre il tango si perdeva
In un mare lontano
Dov’è la tua testa da accarezzare
Dov’è la tua mano

Ora ci mostrano i denti e i coltelli
Ci bucano gli occhi
Non ci sono tanghi da ballare
Bisogna fare in fretta per ricominciare
Tutte le stelle del mondo
Per un pezzo di pane
Per la tua donna
Da portare in campagna a ballare
Per un treno con tanta gente
Che parte davvero
Per un tango da ballare tutti insieme
Ad occhi aperti senza mistero

Suona il suo violino ed è felice

Veniva dal mare
Parlava un'altra lingua
Però sapeva amare
E quel giorno lui prese a mia madre
Sopra un bel prato
L'ora più dolce prima di essere ammazzato

Così lei restò sola nella stanza
La stanza sul porto
Con l'unico vestito ogni giorno più corto
E benché non sapesse il nome
E neppure il paese
Mi aspettò come un dono d'amore fin dal primo mese

Compiva sedici anni quel giorno la mia mamma
Le strofe di taverna
Le cantò a ninna nanna
E stringendomi al petto che sapeva
Sapeva di mare
Giocava a fare la donna con il bimbo da fasciare

E forse fu per gioco o forse per amore
Che mi volle chiamare come nostro Signore
Della sua breve vita è il ricordo più grosso
È tutto in questo nome
Che io mi porto addosso

E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù bambino

Ogni minuto mi dà
L'istinto di cucire il tempo
Di portarti di qua

Un materasso di parole
Scritto apposta per te
E ti direi spegni la luce
Che il cielo c'è.

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
Stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Testa dura, testa di rapa
Vorrei amarti anche qua
Nel cesso di una discoteca
Sopra al tavolo di un bar

Lostare nudi in mezzo a un campo
A sentirsi addosso il vento
Io mi chiedo più di tanto
Che se muoio son contento

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
E stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Canzone cercala se vuoi
Dille, che non mi perda mai
Va, per le strade tra la gente
Diglielo veramente

Lo i miei occhi dai tuoi occhi
Non li staccherei mai
Adesso anzi me li mangio
Tanto tu non lo sai

Occhi di mare e sensa scogli
Il mare sbatte su di me
Che ho sempre fatto solo sbagli
Ma uno sbaglio che cos'è?

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
E stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Canzone trovala se vuooi
Dille che l'aaaamo, se lo vuoi

Vaaa per le strade tra la gente

Non può restare indifferente
E se rimane indifferente non è lei

E stare senza di lei

Non si vive
E stare senza di lei

Dalia,"Qui dove il mare luccica,
e tira forte il vento
su una vecchia terrazza
davanti al golfo di Surriento
un uomo abbraccia una ragazza,
dopo che aveva pianto
poi si schiarisce la voce,
e ricomincia il canto.

Te voglio bene assaje,
ma tanto tanto bene sai
Ã¨ una catena ormai,
che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai.

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare,
pensÃ² alle notti lÃ  in America
ma erano solo le lampare
nella bianca scia di un'elica
sentÃ¬ il dolore nella musica,
si alzÃ² dal pianoforte
ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
gli sembrÃ² piÃ¹ dolce anche la morte
guardÃ² negli occhi la ragazza,
quelli occhi verdi come il mare
poi all'improvviso uscÃ¬ una lacrima,
e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje,
ma tanto tanto bene sai
Ã¨ una catena ormai,
che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Potenza della lirica,
dove ogni dramma Ã¨ un falso
che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
puoi diventare un altro
ma due occhi che ti guardano
cosÃ¬ vicini e veri
ti fan scordare le parole,
confondono i pensieri
cosÃ¬ diventa tutto piccolo,
anche le notti lÃ  in America
ti volti e vedi la tua vita
come la scia di un'elica
ma sÃ¬, Ã¨ la vita che finisce,
ma lui non ci pensÃ² poi tanto
anzi si sentiva giÃ  felice,
e ricominciÃ² il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje,
ma tanto tanto bene sai
Ã¨ una catena ormai,
che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai",Caruso,2002
Dalia,"Chissà chissà domani
Su che cosa metteremo le mani
Se si potrà contare ancora le onde del mare
E alzare la testa
Non esser così seria, rimani

I russi, i russi, gli americani
No lacrime non fermarti fino a domani
Sarà stato forse un tuono
Non mi meraviglio
È una notte di fuoco
Dove sono le tue mani
Nascerà e non avrà paura nostro figlio

E chissà come sarà lui domani
Su quali strade camminerà
Cosa avrà nelle sue mani, le sue mani
Si muoverà e potrà volare
Nuoterà su una stella
Come sei bella
E se è una femmina si chiamerà Futura

Il suo nome detto questa notte
Mette già paura
Sarà diversa bella come una stella
Sarai tu in miniatura
Ma non fermarti voglio ancora baciarti
Chiudi i tuoi occhi non voltarti indietro
Qui tutto il mondo sembra fatto di vetro
E sta cadendo a pezzi come un vecchio presepio

Di più, muoviti più fretta di più, benedetta
Più su, nel silenzio tra le nuvole, più su
Che si arriva alla luna, sì la luna
Ma non è bella come te questa luna
È una sottana americana
Allora su mettendoci di fianco, più su
Guida tu che sono stanco, più su
In mezzo ai razzi e a un batticuore, più su
Son sicuro che c'è il sole
Ma che sole è un cappello di ghiaccio
Questo sole è una catena di ferro
Senza amore
Amore
Amore
Amore

Lento lento adesso batte più lento
Ciao, come stai
Il tuo cuore lo sento
I tuoi occhi così belli non li ho visti mai
Ma adesso non voltarti
Voglio ancora guardarti
Non girare la testa
Dove sono le tue mani
Aspettiamo che ritorni la luce
Di sentire una voce
Aspettiamo senza avere paura, domani",Futura,2002
Dalia,"Santi che pagano il mio pranzo non ce n'è
Sulle panchine in Piazza Grande
Ma quando ho fame di mercanti come me qui non ce n'è

Dormo sull'erba e ho molti amici intorno a me
Gli innamorati in Piazza Grande
Dei loro guai dei loro amori tutto so, sbagliati e no

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
A modo mio avrei bisogno di sognare anch'io

Una famiglia vera e propria non ce l'ho
E la mia casa è Piazza Grande
A chi mi crede prendo amore e amore do, quanto ne ho

Con me di donne generose non ce n'è
Rubo l'amore in Piazza Grande
E meno male che briganti come me qui non ce n'è

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
Avrei bisogno di pregare Dio
Ma la mia vita non la cambierò mai mai
A modo mio quel che sono l'ho voluto io

Lenzuola bianche per coprirci non ne ho
Sotto le stelle in Piazza Grande
E se la vita non ha sogni io li ho e te li do

E se non ci sarà più gente come me
Voglio morire in Piazza Grande
Tra i gatti che non han padrone come me attorno a me

",Piazza Grande,2002
Dalia,"Vorrei essere il vestito che porterai 
Il rossetto che userai 
Vorrei sognarti come non ti ho sognato mai 
Ti incontro per strada e divento triste 
Perchè poi penso che te ne andrai

Vorrei essere l'acqua della doccia che fai 
Le lenzuola del letto dove dormirai 
L'hamburger di sabato sera che mangerai, che mangerai
Vorrei essere il motore della tua macchina 
Così di colpo mi accenderai 

Tu, tu non mi basti mai 
Davvero non mi basti mai 
Tu, tu dolce terra mia 
Dove non sono stato mai

Debbo parlarti come non faccio mai 
Voglio sognarti come non ti sogno mai 
Essere l'anello che porterai 
La spiaggia dove camminerai 
Lo specchio che ti guarda se lo guarderai, lo gurderai

Vorrei essere l'uccello che accarezzerai 
E dalle tue mani non volerei mai
Vorrei esser la tomba quando morirai 
E dove abiterai 

Il cielo sotto il quale dormirai 
Così non ci lasceremo mai 
Neanche se muoio e lo sai

Tu, tu non mi basti mai 
Davvero non mi basti mai 
Io, i,o io ci provo sai 
Non mi dimenticare mai",Tu Non Mi Basti Mai,2002
Dalia,"Sto andando a Washington, ma cosa vado a fare non lo so
Sono molto in alto, non vedo niente
Non si vede un accidente da qui
Lei ha gli occhi a mandorla e una faccina piccola così
È con i suoi fratelli, piccolina come quelli
Vuoi vedere la foto che ho con me
Ma cos'è che sta volando, sembra una bandiera
Che cosa sta ancora volando, lentamente si avvicina

Ogni piccolo movimento spara, prima che l'altro faccia lo stesso con te
Ogni piccolo sentimento spara, è meglio non chiedersi niente
Ma stavolta voglio vedere chi è

Son partito da London City dove c'erano i Beatles e il Rock & Roll
Ero una macchina negra, ma adesso mi chiamano Zebra
Da quando mi han messo le braccia di un bianco di nome John
Vuoi andare a Washington: ma cosa vai a fare laggiù?
Qui c'è solo un sasso non si vede un casso
Non è rimasto niente nemmeno là
Chissà se mi sta ascoltando, è una bella mattina
Chissà se anche lui sta pensando
Eccolo lì che si avvicina

Ogni piccolo movimento spara, prima che l'altro faccia lo stesso con te
Ma qui non si muove niente, non è rimasto nessuno
Siamo solo io e te",Washington,2002

Look, what they've done to my song
When it's the only thing that I could you
Half light and the storming got how long mama
Look, what they've done to my song

Ils ont traduit ma chanson, ma
Ils ont trahi ma chanson, ma
Ce n'était rien qu'une chanson
Mais c'était ma chanson, ma
Ils ont changé ma chanson

Sachant comme personne parler d’amour aux femmes
Il offrit à Marie une bague de pacotille
Prit sa jeunesse et repartit sur les vagues

Sans comprendre elle resta dans la chambre d’avril à décembre
Avec sa robe courte de jour en jour plus courte
La fille ne savait pas grand-chose des gens et des usages
Elle n’avait connu qu’un homme, l’homme des lointains rivages

Elle n’avait que seize ans quand l’enfant vint au monde
De taverne en taverne elle chantait à la ronde
Des refrains de bastringues en croyant que c’était des berceuses
Elle jouait à la Madone, elle n’était pas malheureuse

Elle passait comme une ombre dans les faubourgs de Rome
Se prenant pour la Vierge, que le Ciel lui pardonne
De sa vie brève, il n’est rien resté que l’enfant de la chance
Et que ce nom qu’il porte comme une croix immense

Comme un fardeau aussi lourd que le monde posé sur son dos
Ce drôle de nom de baptême Jésus Bambino

Sur un vieux quai de gare j'avais le cœur dans l'eau

Salut Salaud
Ce soir t'es pas bavard t'es pas bien dans ta peau
T'as une guerre de retard ou une victoire en trop
T'as perdu la mémoire mais ce serait trop beau

Salut Salaud
T'as toujours une belle gueule mêm’ quand tu en fais trop
On n'peut pas t'laisser seul t'es comme un gosse idiot
T'as des yeux d'épagneul et ça m'fait froid dans l'dos

Salut Salaud
T'as pas changé d'adresse j'connais ton numéro
Le comique la tendresse la violence et les mots
Bravo, bravo

Salut Salaud
C'est vrai t'as fait fortune dans tous les casinos
T'aurais donné la lune pour un jeton de trop
Y a des blondes moitié brunes qui voulaient t'faire la peau

Salut Salaud
Il te manqu’ la guitare pour jouer du Flamenco
Autrefois dans les bars on t'app’lait Idalgo
Ce soir t'as pas envie de parler des tarots

Salut Salaud
T'as toujours une belle gueule même quand tu en fais trop
On n'peut pas t'laisser seul t'es comme un gosse idiot
T'as des yeux d'épagneul et ça m'fait froid dans l'dos

Salut Salaud
T'as pas changé d'adresse j'connais ton numéro
Le comique la tendresse la violence et les mots
Bravo, bravo

De partir mais je m'en vais
Cette fois je te jure que c'est vrai
Je ne veux plus rester

Cent fois j'ai voulu te quitter
Et puis cent fois
Je n'ai pas eu la force de partir
J'avais trop peur de voir
La vie sans toi c'est fini

Vado via, vado via je n'en vais
Je dois m'en aller vivre je veux vivre etre libre
Et poursuivre tous mes rêves
Comme au temps où je croyais encor
A l'arc en ciel qui vient après la pluie, c'est fini

Vado via, vado via
Je n'en vais
Je dois m'en aller

Donne, donne moi le courage qui pardonne
Tout le mal que l'on a pu se faire
Et laisse moi vivre ma vie sans toi c'est fini

Vado via, vado via

Je dois m'en aller

Vado, vado via adesso
Che posso ti lascio adesso
Che posso ti lascio, ti lascio
Vado via

Dalida,"LE VENITIEN DE LEVALLOIS 
Auteur : Didier BARBELIVIEN
Compositeur : Eric CHARDEN

Il y a vingt ans il passait la frontière
Avec une guitare et ses frères
Paris, brouillard arrivé gare de Lyon
Le café français sentait bon
Hôtel des voyageurs ils étaient quelques uns
A parler Arabe ou Italien
Vingt ans après quelque chose a changé
Dans son cœur Méditerranée
Ses trois grands frères ont grandi par ici
La France est devenu son pays
Quand on dit de lui que c'est un étranger
Il dit qu'on est tous des immigrés

Refrain:
C'est un vénitien de Levallois
Un Français de cœur comme il y en a
Aventurier de l'aventura
C'est un baladin comme vous et moi
C'est un Portugais de Courbevoie
Avec le soleil au bout des doigts
Et on l'appelle ainsi Piero Pietro qui est pour moi
Fils de Joseph et de Santa Maria

D'autres après lui ont brisé la frontière
De tous les ghettos de la terre
Ils sont venus d'Afrique ou de Pologne
Le ciel n'appartient à personne
Il porte un drapeau couleur de liberté
Nouvel homme nouvelle identité

Refrain:
C'est un vénitiens de Levallois
Un Français de cœur comme il y en a
Aventurier de l'aventura
C'est un baladin comme vous et moi
C'est un Portugais de Courbevoie
Avec le soleil au bout des doigts

Dalida,"Une vie c'est un instant c'est une éternité
Une vie c'est minuscule et c'est illimité
Une vie c'est un mensonge et une vérité
Une vie c'est fait de rêves et de réalités

Une vie c'est un frisson qui vient dont ne sait où
Une vie une étincelle sur un peu de boue
Une vie c'est une flamme qui nous tient debout
Une vie c'est toi, c'est moi, c'est vous, c'est nous

Mon amour, que c'est beau
Les oiseaux du matin sur tes lèvres
Mon amour, que c'est chaud
Ce ruisseau dans nos mains cette fièvre

Notre vie c'est toi, c'est moi
C'est nos doigts enlacés
Notre vie c'est le printemps toujours recommencé
Notre vie c'est mon bonheur de pouvoir t'embrasser
Notre envie de vivre ensemble et de nous caresser
Notre vie dans chaque instant est une éternité
Notre vie faite de rêves et de réalités
Notre vie c'est une étoile en moi qui va briller
Notre vie c'est un enfant qui va crier",Une Vie,
Dalida,"Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Never on Sunday [Les Enfants du Pirée] [*],1960
Dalida,"Dis-moi des mots 
Dis-moi des mots 
De ta musique de poète 
Dis-moi des mots

Tes mots sont seuls amis qui restent 
Bien plus beaux que les souvenirs 

Des chansons de soleil 
Avec des bruits de mer 
Pour les amants du ciel 
Les amants de la terre 
Mon coeur les a chantés 
Mes yeux en ont pleuré 
Elles font comme une ronde 
Une ronde éperdue

Sans cesse ils tournent dans ma tête

Avec des bruits de mer 
Pour les amants du ciel 
Les amants de la terre 
Mon coeur veut les offrir 
A ceux dont le désir 
Dans leurs yeux 
Fait la ronde 
Une ronde d'amour 
Dans leurs yeux 
Font une ronde 
De mots de tous les jours 

Ceux que tu m'as offerts 
Doux comme une prière 
Et qui sont la lumière 
Qui peut effacer l'ombre

Que je pourrais chanter aux autres 
Pour les empêcher de mourir",Dis-Moi des Mots,1968
Dalida,"Something is going wrong
With the singer and the song
And the music isn't gentle anymore
there's a mist across the moon
And the sun's too hot at noon
And the house is dark behind the broken door
Where the flowers used to grow
With their leaves are hanging low
And the constant shadow lies across the floor
there's a strange and empty sky
Where the wild birds used to fly
And I never tasted bitter rain before
And will the grass be gone from underneath the sky
Will the golden flower wither soon and die
Will the fire burn out the land
And the sea fill-up with sand
Will the last word ever spoken be why?
Will the last word ever spoken be why?
Someone's lost the plan 
For the brotherhood of man
And no one's trying to find it anymore
And the winds become a sigh
For those who hate and those who die
And the waves are black and slow along the shore
And will the grass be gone from underneath the sky
Will the golden flower wither soon and die
Will the fire burn out the land
And the sea fill-up with sand
Will the last word ever spoken be why?
Will the last word ever spoken be why, why, why?
Will the last word ever spoken be ?.WHY?",Non,1971
Dalida,"Avec le temps
Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va
On oublie le visage
Et l'on oublie la voix
Le cœur quand ça bat plus
C'est pas la peine d'aller chercher plus loin
Faut laisser faire, c'est très bien

Avec le temps
Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va
L'autre qu'on adorait
Qu'on cherchait sous la pluie
L'autre qu'on devinait au détour d'un regard entre les lignes
Entre les mots et sous le fard d'un serment maquillé
Qui s'en va faire sa nuit

Avec le temps tout s'évanouit...
Avec le temps, avec le temps, va, tout s'en va
Même les plus chouettes souvenirs
Ça t'a une de ces gueules
À la galerie ""J'farfouille"" dans les rayons de la mort
Le samedi soir quand la tendresse s'en va toute seule

Avec le temps
Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va
L'autre à qui l'on croyait, pour un rhume, pour un rien
L'autre à qui l'on donnait du vent et des bijoux 
Pour qui l'on eût vendu son âme pour quelques sous
Devant quoi l'on s'traînait comme traînent les chiens

Avec le temps, avec le temps, va
Tout s'en va
On oublie les passions et l'on oublie les voix
Qui vous disaient tout bas, les mots des pauvres gens 
""Ne rentre pas trop tard, surtout ne prends pas froid""

Avec le temps
Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va et l'on se sent blanchi
Comme un cheval fourbu et l'on se sent glacé
Dans un lit de hasard et l'on se sent tout seul
Peut-être, mais peinard
Et l'on se sent floué par les années perdues
Alors vraiment, avec le temps
On n'aime plus",Avec le Temps,1992
Dalida,"Besame besame mucho
Cette chanson d'autrefois je la chante pour toi
Besame besame mucho
Comme une histoire d'amour qui ne finirait pas
On l'a chantée dans les rues
Sous des ciels inconnus et dans toute la France
On la croyait oubliée
Et pour mieux nous aimer voilà qu'elle recommence
Besame besame mucho
Si dans un autre pays ça veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi

On ne demande à l'amour
Ni serment de toujours ni décor fantastique
Pour nous aimer il nous faut
Simplement quelque mots qui vont sur la musique

Si dans un autre pays ça veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi

Moi, tout ce que je veux
See'est que l'on m'aime un peu
Et je l'avoue je suis comblée
Depuis que je suis née depuis que j'ai chanté
J'ai des amoureux par milliers
On dit de moi que certains soir
Je joue Sarah Bernhardt
See'est vrai, see'est vrai
On dit que mon meilleur copain
See'est Teilhard de Chardin
See'est vrai, see'est vrai
Moi, j'aime les ritournelles intellectuelles

Je suis comme le Bon Dieu m'a faite
Et see'est très bien comme ça

Que je ne passerai pas le printemps

J'attendrai toujours ton retour
J'attendrai car l'oiseau qui s'enfuit
Vient chercher l'oubli dans son nid
Le temps passe et court en battant tristement
Dans mon see?you're si lourd
Et pourtant j'attendrai ton retour
J'attendrai le jour et la nuit
J'attendrai toujours ton retour
J'attendrai car l'oiseau qui s'enfuit
Vient chercher l'oubli dans son nid
Le temps passe et court en battant tristement
Dans mon see?you're si lourd
Et pourtant j'attendrai ton retour
Le vent m'apporte de bruits lointains
Guettant ma porte j'écoute en vain
Hélas, plus rien plus rien ne vient
J'attendrai le jour et la nuit
J'attendrai toujours ton retour
J'attendrai car l'oiseau qui s'enfuit
Vient chercher l'oubli dans son nid
Le temps passe et court en battant tristement

Ma vie cesse quand tu pars
Je n'ais plus de vie et même mon lit
Ce transforme en quai de gare
Quand tu t'en vas

Complètement malade
Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir
Et qu'elle me laissait seul avec mon désespoir

Je suis malade parfaitement malade
T'arrive on ne sait jamais quand
Tu repars on ne sait jamais où
Et ça va faire bientôt deux ans
Que tu t'en fous

Comme à un rocher
Comme à un péché
Je suis accroché à toi
Je suis fatigué je suis épuisé
De faire semblant d'être heureuse quand ils sont là

Je bois toutes les nuits
Mais tous les whiskies
Pour moi on le même goût
Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau
Je ne sais plus où aller tu es partout

Je suis malade
Complètement malade
Je verse mon sang dans ton corps
Et je suis comme un oiseau mort quand toi tu dors

Je suis malade
Parfaitement malade
Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants
Tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots
Pourtant moi j'avais du talent avant ta peau

Cet amour me tue
Si ça continue je crèverai seul avec moi
Près de ma radio comme un gosse idiot
Écoutant ma propre voix qui chantera

Complètement malade
Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir
Et qu'elle me laissait seul avec mon désespoir

Tu es mon rêve défendu
Oui tellement faux
Mon seul tourment et mon unique espérance
Rien ne t'arrêtes quand tu commences
Si tu savais comme j'ai envie d'un peu de silence
Tu es pour moi la seule musique

Dalida,"Je vais vous raconter
Avant de vous quitter
L'histoire d'un p'tit village près de Napoli
Nous étions quatre amis
Au bal tous les samedis
A jouer, à chanter toute la nuit
Giorgio à la guitare
Sandro à la mandoline
Moi je dansais en frappant du tambourin
Mais tous ceux qui venaient
C'était pour écouter
Celui qui faisait battre tous les cœurs
Et quand il arrivait
La foule s'écriait
Arriva, Gigi l'Amoroso
Croqueur d'amour, l'œil de velours comme une caresse
Gigi l'Amoroso
Toujours vainqueur, parfois sans cœur
Mais jamais sans tendresse
Partout, c'était la fête quand il chantait
Zaza, luna caprese o sole mio
Gigi Giuseppe
Mais tout le monde l'appelait Gigi l'Amour
Et les femmes étaient folles de lui, toutes
La femme du boulanger, qui fermait sa boutique tous les mardis pour aller
La femme du notaire qui était une sainte et qui n'avait jamais tromper son
Mari auparavant
Et la veuve du colonel
La veuve du colonel qui ne porta plus le deuil parce qu'il n'aimait pas le
Noir
Toutes, je vous dis
Même moi, mais moi, Gigi aimait trop sa liberté, jusqu'au jour où
Une riche Américaine
A grands coups de ""Je t'aime""
Lui proposa d'aller jusqu'à Hollywood
Tu seras le plus beau
De tous les Caruzos
Lui disait-elle jusqu'à en perdre haleine
Nous voilà à la gare
Avec tous nos mouchoirs
Le cœur serré, émus par ce grand départ
Pourtant on était fier
Qu'il dépasse nos frontières
Gigi partait conquérir l'Amérique
Et quand il arriva
Le village était là
Arriva, Gigi l'Amoroso
Croqueur d'amour, l'oœil de velours comme une caresse
Gigi l'Amoroso
Toujours vainqueur, parfois sans cœur
Mais jamais sans tendresse
Et là, devant la foule, il a chanté
Zaza, luna caprese, o sole mio
Gigi, quand le train est disparu, nous sommes tous rentrés chez nous
Et le lendemain, le village n'était plus le même
La femme du boulanger refusa d'allumer son four
La femme du notaire, par désespoir, pris plusieurs amants
Et la veuve du colonel ferma ses persiennes et reprit le deuil pour la
Seconde fois
Oui, le village avait bien changé
Et moi
Les années ont passé
Cinq hivers, cinq étés
""No news"" c'était ""good news"", on nous avait dit
Il a fallu du temps
Du courage et du temps
Pour arriver à continuer sans lui
Et malgré son absence
La nuit dans le silence
En pliant nos costumes et nos instruments
On entendait venir
Comme une larme un soupir
Du fond de la salle cette mélodie
Croqueur d'amour, l'œil de velours comme une caresse
Gigi, Gigi, c'est toi là-bas dans le noir
Attends, laisse-moi te regarder
Mais tu pleures
Tu pleures Gigi
Ca n'a pas été là-bas, hein
Et alors, et alors qu'est-ce qu'ils comprennent ces Américains à part le rock
Et le twist, hein
Ma Gigi, qu'est-ce que tu croyais devenir comme ça, Gigi l'Americano?
E invece no, tu sei Giuseppe Frabrizio Luca Santini
Et tu es napolitain
Ecoute, Giorgio s'est mis à la guitare
Attends, Sandro est là aussi
Mais, mais tu ne peux pas t'en aller comme ça
Ici, tu es chez toi
Ici, tu es le roi
Tu entends, tu les entends, Gigi
Ils sont tous là
Ils ont dû te reconnaître à la gare
Chante Gigi, chante, c'est ton public
Chante pour eux, chante pour moi qui n'ai jamais su te parler
Oui, vas-y, bravo Gigi, chante

Que le jour se lèvera

Des notes qui flottent au ciel d'été
Déjà je sens que cet air là
Va soulever nos pas

Les jours sont courts pour les amants
L'été va bientôt nous quitter
Il faut en profiter

Si tu es celui qui vole
Au temps des instants d'oubli
Qui se méfie des paroles
Vient danser le Sirtaki

Au milieu de ses tracas
Aux bateaux qui se balancent
Viens danser avec Zorba

Si tu es celui qui vide
Le bonheur jusqu'à la lie
En se moquant bien des rides

Toi qui pars à Bahia
Va danser dans les bras d’Helena !...
On est vite amoureux
Quand on voit les beaux yeux d’Helena !...
Que le ciel te sourit

Et bon voyage !

Mais la fill’ l’est aussi
Tu verras…

On oublie « ma nana » 
Quand on est dans les bras D’Helena !...
La chaleur de son corps
Vous rend fou, plus encor que sa voix !...
Mais au jeu de l’amour, c’est toujours
La plus sage :
Tu n’auras que le droit
De danser dans les bras d’Helena

Quittant le bateau, 
Après vingt jours sur l’eau
Tu auras, devant toi, Bahia !...
Pourtant, les rues ne s’animent 
Qu’a la fin du jour, là-bas…
Tu verras alors, 
En t’éloignant du port
La Plaza Cordoba
Et là…
Un cabaret qu’on appelle
L’EstréLlita de Bahia !...

Toi qui pars à Bahia
Va danser dans les bras d’Helena !...
Son regard en dit long
On en perd la raison quelque fois !...
Mais n’ai pas d’illusions,
Mon garçon
Après la danse, 
Elle oubliera l’élan
De ton cœur trop galant
Tu verras…

Plus d’un homme avant toi, 
A dansé dans les bras d’Helena !...
Mais aucun d’eux, je crois, 
N’a connu les baisers d’Helena !...
Si tu peux la troubler, 
L’embrasser,
Quelle chance !...
Car c’est elle, après ça 
Qui toujours restera
Dans tes bras
Car c’est elle, après ça,
Qui toujours restera
Dans tes bras !...",Héléna,1998

Sous le ciel rose de juillet,
Cachés dans l'ombre des colines
De San Cristina ils m'attendaient

Dans ces yeux là j'ai vu d'avance
Que le bonheur me disait : viens?

On a pu voir sous le ciel bleu,
Bercés par la brise marine
De San Cristina, deux amoureux !

De ne sonner que les mâtines
Quand San Cristina se réveillait

On l'entendit sonner un jour

Et le petit chalet de bois
Dont je lui fais franchir la porte
En la tenant entre mes bras?

And I am a big lady

Then I didn't know love could hurt me so
Slowly she replied, tears had filled her eyes
Baby not so fast let your young life last

My age was not the same still we played the game
Her eyes were filled with pride and slowly she replied
Soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride

Mama, will the hurt go away deep inside

Et l'on ose à peine, rompre les silences
Mieux vaudrait la haine, que l'indifférence
Mais je veux vivre, vivre, vivre, je veux qu'on m'aime

Ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao
Ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao

Nous vivons dans du rose
Dans du gris monotone
J'ai besoin d'autre chose
Que d'un chat qui ronronne

Je veux voir le monde, qu'il soit gai ou triste
Qu'il chante ou qu'il gronde, pourvu qu'il existe
Je veux voir des villes, qu'elles soient blanches ou rouges
Et des yeux qui brillent, et des gens qui bougent
Moi je veux vivre, vivre, vivre, comme ceux qui s'aiment

Ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao
Ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao

Je te laisse tes livres
La cloche de l'église
La tiédeur de vivre
Dans cette maison grise

Ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao
Ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao amore, ciao
Ciao amore, ciao

Dalida,"D'où viens-tu, gitan ?
Je viens de Bohème.
D'où viens-tu, gitan ?
Je viens d'Italie,
Et toi, beau gitan ?
De l'Andalousie,
Et toi, vieux gitan, d'où viens-tu ?
Je viens d'un pays qui n'existe plus...

REFRAIN
Les chevaux rassemblés le long de la barrière
Le flanc gris de poussière
Le naseau écumant,
Les gitans sont assis près de la flamme claire.
Qui jette à la clairière
Leurs ombres de géants,
Et dans la nuit
Monte un refrain bizarre,
Et dans la nuit
Bat le coeur des guitares.
C'est le chant des errants qui n'ont pas de frontière,
C'est l'ardente prière
De la nuit des gitans.

Où vas-tu gitan ?
Je vais en Bohème.
Où vas-tu, gitan ?
Revoir l'Italie,
Et toi, beau gitan ?
En Andalousie.
Et toi, vieux gitan, mon ami ?
Je suis bien trop vieux, moi je reste ici...

REFRAIN
Avant de repartir pour un nouveau voyage
Vers d'autres paysages
Sur des chemins mouvants,
Laisse encore un instant vagabonder ton rêve
Avant que la nuit brève
Le réduise à néant.
Chante, gitan,
Ton pays de Cocagne ;
Chante gitan,
Ton château en Espagne.
C'est le chant des errants qui n'ont pas de frontière,
C'est l'ardente prière
De la nuit des gitans.

De la nuit des gitans.",Les Gitans,2000
Dalida,"Il a suffit qu'un beau matin
Un tambourin suive le refrain d'une guitare
Pour que partout de Tahiti à la Volga
Aussitôt ce soit la même histoire

Et vole les jolies demoiselles
Comme des tourterelles pour s'en aller danser
En ribambelle comme des hirondelles
S'en vont à tire d'ailes au soleil de l'été

Il a suffit qu'un beau matin
Un tambourin suive le refrain des Balalaï-aïka
Pour qu'aussitôt la fille en pleurs
Oublie son cœur dans les coquelicots
Le long de la Volga

Et danse, danse sous les tonnelles
La pauvre demoiselle qui avait tant pleuré
Et recommence avant les fiançailles
Les baisers dans la paille derrière les moulins

Il a suffit qu'un beau matin
Un tambourin suive le refrain d'une guitare
Pour qu'aussitôt à Tahiti, la Vahiné
Parte dans les flots larguer l'amarre

Et vole la jolie demoiselle
Comme une tourterelle pour s'en aller danser
Vogue la belle, vogue sur la lagune
Les vagues sous la lune ont le goût des baisers

À Tahiti ou à Capri
Comme là-bas sur la Volga

Pour aller loin au-delà des nuages

Sont dérisoires

Et pendant qu'il se rhabillait

Un po d'amore, un po d'amore 

Sopra la pietra 
Che il sole ha bruciato 
Ora è nato 
Un piccolo fiore 
Questo vuol dire 
Che ancora una volta
Il cielo ha sentito
Una voce che prega 

E che chiede, e che chiede 
Un po d'amore, un po d'amore per sè 

Sopra la pietra 
Ho seritto il mio nome 
Un'ombra è venuta 
E mi ha preso per man 

Sembra che ora 
Una voce lontana 
Ripeta ancora 
Queste brevi parole 

Io ti prego, io ti chiedo 
Un po d'amore, un po d'amore per me 
Io ti prego, io ti chiedo 
Un po d'amore, un po d'amore per me",Un Po' d'Amore [Night in White Satin],2008
Dalida,"Oh! Vive le vent, vive le vent
Vive le vent d'hiver
Boule de neige et jour de l'an
Et bonne année grand-mère

Sur le long chemin
Tout blanc de neige blanche
Un vieux monsieur s'avance
Avec sa canne dans la main
Et tout là-haut le vent
Qui siffle dans les branches
Lui souffle la romance
Qu'il chantait petit enfant

Oh, Vive le vent, vive le vent
Vive le vent d'hiver
Qui s'en va sifflant, soufflant
Dans les grands sapins verts
Oh! Vive le temps, vive le temps
Vive le temps d'hiver
Boule de neige et jour de l'an
Et bonne année grand-mère
Joyeux, joyeux Noël
Aux mille bougies
Quand chantent vers le ciel
Les cloches de la nuit,
Oh! Vive le vent, vive le vent
Vive le vent d'hiver
Qui rapporte aux vieux enfants
Leurs souvenirs d'hier

Et le vieux monsieur
Descend vers le village,
C'est l'heure où tout est sage
Et l'ombre danse au coin du feu
Mais dans chaque maison
Il flotte un air de fête
Partout la table est prête",Vive Le Vent,2012

Dalida,"Ay mourir pour toi
A l’instant où ta main me frôle
Laisser ma vie sur ton épaule
Bercé par le son de ta voix

Ay mourir d’amour
T’offrir ma dernière seconde
Et sans regret quitter le monde
En emportant mon plus beau jour

Pour garder notre bonheur
Comme il est là
Ne pas connaître la douleur
Par toi
Et la terrible certitude
De la solitude

Ay mourir pour toi
Prendre le meilleur de nous-mêmes
Dans le souffle de ton je t’aime
Et m’endormir avec mes joies

Parle moi
Console-moi
J’ai peur du jour qui va naître
Il sera le dernier peut-être
Que notre bonheur va connaître

Serre-moi
Apaise-moi
Quand j’ai l’angoisse du pire
Ne ris pas quand tu m’entends dire
Qu’au fond mourir
Pour mourir

Ay mourir d’amour
A l’instant où ta main me frôle
Laisser ma vie sur ton épaule
Bercé par le son de ta voix

Ay mourir d’amour
T’offrir ma dernière seconde
Et sans regret quitter le monde
En Emportant mon plus beau jour

Pour garder notre bonheur
Comme il est là
Ne pas connaître la douleur
Par toi
Et la terrible certitude
De la solitude

Ay mourir pour toi
Prendre le meilleur de nous-mêmes
Dans le souffle de ton je t’aime
Et m’endormir avec mes joies
Mourir pour toi",Ay ! mourir pour toi,
Dalila,"Shattered dreams, worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well 
The many sounds that meet our ears 
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you 
Will echo in your mind 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered by prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer
Thank you God 
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on, let's fall in love",I Believe,1999
Dalima,"Ad nanus tundet. 
Ad magus carminibus. 
In aliam naturam convertet.
Donum a dei qui ad domini draci dareti fuerimus. 
Maleus, arcus, ascia et gladius",Intro,2000
Dalima,"In a world of misery
Within this, three planets collide
Brotha Lynch, Dalima, Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride

Wait a minute, I’m from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it, I’ll spit enough, aim sturdy
Cut it up, gut it up, with colds cuts
And in a oven I’ll heat it up, came dirty
I be off’a that Crip tonight
Turn ‘em into liquid ice, paint his jersey
Leave ‘em in the back of the alcove
Like Helter Skelt’, stick it to ‘em like velcro
Nigga, I’m a bitch killer
I’m a dig a ditch, quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture wit'cha
I’m a jack knife, strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
But them quick into rippin’ your guts
Deep heat, deplete you with the meat cleaver
That I didn’t see you either
Phone call or receiver, court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat, I’m bringin’ the seasonage
And a suicide note, do-or-die Loc
Keys in the backseat, cut necks
Some sexist ‘bout to kidnap Brotha Lynch
I’m neckless, expect this

[Chorus: x2]
(Welcome to my world)
Where hearts are broken, and bars
Are open, potions pullin’ me closer
(Welcome to my world)
Dark’s my ocean, my Ark is floatin’
But not livin’ like I’m supposed to

(Lyrical asylum)
‘Cause I be Dalima, motherfuckers hatin’ me for the longest
Could it be critical ‘cause I’m lyrically flawless?
And if I’m heated I cannot be mentally cautious?
(Diggin' the pain) I get deep peepin’ the flame
Only can I be held accountable for makin’ the change
To whatever regards are gonna be (Insane)
In the middle of a stage, I’m bustin’ like a 12-Gauge
You can never bring it to a nigga that’ll hang you up
Slip a couple millions up in your drink for you
Homicidal with the fully-loaded rifle
An undecided of whether or not I can peel brains or guts
(I get spaced out sometimes)
And it’s like I’m a heathen, whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap a motherfucker stop breathin’
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason? (Nah)
Well, let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin’ future (Indeed)
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of (My friends' souls)
Nigga you better get ready ‘cause
We done put together the fettiest chemical frame
Energetic when I let it, embed it in your brain
Tech N9ne, Dalima, Brotha Lynch like

[Chorus: x2]

(Dlrow ym ot emocleW)
(World)

Fight this phantom, your freakin’ family will fall flat
Bunk Bianca's beat ‘em black and blue with a baseball bat
I might be a small cat, but I won’t use discretion
Hit ‘em with a weapon, if he steppin’ with a mall rat
20 minus 11, I make ‘em all scat!
Not prosperous now, Tech’s not with his crowd
He’s lost in his clouds
Rather be off’ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I’ve been broke, so I might swipe your chedder
You better get ready to give me, I got a vendetta
Comin’ to get it, whether weed or money, whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon' see on me TV, you better believe me
Takin’ over this and never the opposite
Rewrite my life, gimme light, inner fight for what’s right
Allah Liberate, Cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim sums, then comes Diablo
I need a medic ‘cause I murder energetic
In the cerebellum never tell ‘em I got
One of the worst problems in the Medulla Oblongata
And you ought to go in one hell of a shot!
No more darkness, how did I start this?
Feelin' bizarre shit, like kickin’ your carcass
I am the ruler in my kingdom and my Dark Seas hot
Step into My World and your heartbeat stop!

[Chorus: x2]",My World,2006
Dalimas,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stay there too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh! Oh! Sweet child o' mine
Oh! Oh! Sweet love of' mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide

And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh! Oh! Sweet child o' mine
Oh! Oh! Sweet love of mine

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go (sweet child)
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now

Sweet child o' mine",Sweet Child O' Mine,2006
Dalimas,"Josie's on a vacation far away, 
Come around and talk it over 
So many things that I want to say 
You know I like my girls a little bit older 
I just want to use your love tonight 
I don't want to lose your love tonight 
I ain't got many friends left to talk to 
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble 
You know I'd do anything for you 
Stay the night but keep it under cover 
I just want to use your love tonight 
I don't want to lose your love tonight 
Try to stop my hands from shaking 
but something in my mind's not making sense 
It's been a while since we were all alone 
but I can't hide the way I'm feeling 
As you're leaving please would you close the 
door 
and don't forget what I told ya 
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong 
Another shoulder to cry upon 
I just want to use your love tonight 
I don't want to lose your love tonight 
Use your love 
Lose your love 
Your love

				",Your Love,2006
Dalimas,"Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day working for her man
She brings home her pay, for love, for love
 
She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
 
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
 
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
Baby, it's okay, someday
 
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
 
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
 
Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
 
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
 
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer",Livin' on a Prayer [DJ Tom Hopkins Remix],2006
Daline Jones,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2008
Daline Jones,"The dark is filled with dreams
So many dreams, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of
Oh, so many stars, so many stars?

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of
Oh, so many stars, so many stars?
So many stars, so many stars, so many stars",So Many Stars,2008
Dalla,"Vita in te ci credo
Le nebbie si diradano 
E ormai ti vedo
Non è stato facile 
Uscire da un passato 
Che mi ha lavato l'anima 
Fino a quasi renderla un po' sdrucita

Vita io ti credo 
Tu così purissima
Da non sapere il modo
L'arte di difendermi
E così ho vissuto quasi rotolandomi
Per non dover ammetter d'aver perduto

Anche gli angeli capita a volte sai si sporcano
Ma la sofferenza tocca il limite
E cosi cancella tutto e rinasce un fiore sopra un fatto brutto
Siamo angeli con le rughe un po' feroci sugli zigomi
Forse un po' più stanchi ma più liberi
Urgenti di un amore, che raggiunge chi lo vuole respirare
Vita io ti credo

Dopo che ho guardato a lungo, adesso io mi siedonon ci son rivincite 
Nè dubbi nè incertezze
Ora il fondo è limpido, ora ascolto immobile le tue carezze
Anche gli angeli capita a volte sai si sporcano
Ma la sofferenza tocca il limite
E cosi cancella tutto e rinasce un fiore sopra un fatto brutto
 
Siamo angeli con le rughe un po' feroci sugli zigomi
Forse un po' più stanchi ma più liberi
Urgenti di un amore, che raggiunge chi lo vuole respirare

Dallaman,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star

I believe I can fly fly fly 
I believe I can fly fly fly 
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I believe I can fly fly fly 
I believe I can fly fly fly 
I'm so high
I'm so high

I Believe I can fly

Aye Aye Aye
Bitch I'm sittin' so high, I believe I can fly
The coupe looks delicious the rims are waving bye
? long like Diddy, I put on for my city
Cologne Kush and Henny, I'm gone in that Hemi
I'm gold but you don't hear me, four to the dome if you can hear me
They say I need a pull-up when I pull up I'm the shit man
When I grow up I wanna be like t-pain a hit man
But do yourself a favor partna don't be talkin' shit man
Your broad done up and broke your heart my whole squad hit man
Hold up I see dead people, its just the dead white guys on my bread people

[Chorus]

I'm high as the moon and I'm flyer than a mosquito
Stacking my chips I got a bank full of Doritos
I'm too cool for school so I'm teaching a class
Chiefin' on that purple rain partna puff puff pass
See im higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream
Rolling off of mac Dre leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh so clean exhale sticky green
I got the top steady droppin' like record sales
Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite
I'm so high

[Chorus]

I believe I can lean spite and codeine
Someones sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt fire it up lets get high
You can call me g5 cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile cuz I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin' with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? dont you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

Dallas Christian Jazz Band,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Or little darlin' do you want me to leave you alone
You got your head in your hands and I don't know why

Is that your dirty heart
Is that your dirty heart

The sky's turning little darling, a storm's on the way
Nobody's gonna hear you cry at the end of the day
The rains are comin to wash down the filth and the grime

Off the dirty hearts, off the dirty

Dallas Crane,"Well the ocean spreads out the front of my house
If you come from north start heading down south
I watch the fast cars go past
While sipping gin from my glass
And bring a smoke to the lips of my mouth

'Cause I'm really fond of where I live
In the suicidal part of the town
I can always get a grip if my mind permits
Otherwise I go and lay down

Lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down

What's that who's smashing bottles out the front of my house?
It's morning and I'm trying to sleep
Well a nine to five life is what my being's avoiding
But I gotta work 'cause nothin's free or cheap
Now I'm getting used to the football
And the control it's gotten over the town
'Cause I like to scream at shit when my throat permits
Otherwise I go and lay down

[Chorus]
Well lay down everything
Take it off in front of me
Lay down next to me
For Christ's sakes let me breathe

Well god I dunno what'll make me happy
Is it something good or evil and bad
And if I look the other way will my thoughts decay?
'Cause I don't want to bury my head deep in the sand
This tied knot you can never undo
You can call but don't make a sound
'Cause I can always drink and shit when my funds permit
Otherwise I'm just gonna go and lay down

[Chorus]",Lay Down,2000
Dallas Crane,"Just in time my love
Made a wish tonight
This old daddy's gonna
Keep you away from nasty Satan

Kiss this on the lips
And leave a swig for me
I'm so glad you could 
Come on over and

Sit on my knee
And fall in love with me
Hey it's alright
I can sit here all night

I'm the araldite 
On your broken dream
I'm the green percent 
In your nicotine

I twisted my ankle walking to the stand

DNR predicted deer season was doomed
Well me and my buddies we got to thinking
Sitting around one night drinking
How we gunna fill up our deer tags
Then a light went off and I started to grin
I remembered about my big grain bin
We started fillin' up 50 pound bags
Of them yellow acorns
They were fare weight in gold

I'm gonna have more meat than my deep freeze can hold
With all them yellow acorns

Yea we filled us up a dump truck load
And the farm looked like the yellow brick road

Then a monster buck came sniffing round
I was bout to lay to old hammer down
When I heard a voice say
Get down from there boy

Well I showed the warden my wanted sign
That I posted up on my property line
It said this here corn is to feed the birds and squirrels aright
Well let me just make one thing clear
Any deer caught feeding here is trespassing
And will be shot on sight

And then he slipped them cuffs around my arms
Took all I had cept the farm
He took my truck my gun
Took my cold beer

Is on TV and in a magazine

My daddy plowed the ground and prayed that some day we could leave
This run down mortaged Oklahoma farm
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my mama
That he finally saved enough for us to go
California was his dream a paradise wall he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so
California cottonfields
Where labor camps were full of worried men with broken dreams
California cottonfields was as close to wealth as daddy ever came

Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From daddy's plow and the fruit that mama canned
Some folks came to say farewell and see what all we had to sell
But some just came to shake my daddy's hand

O.C. Smith

Oh the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

Well the weeds were high, the corn was dry when daddy took to drinking
Him and Sally Walker they up and they ran away
Then Mama shed a silent tear and then she promised fourteen children
I swear you'll never see a hungry day
When mama sacrificed her pride the neighbours started talking
But we was much too young to understand the things they said
All we really cared about was mama's chicken dumplings
And the goodnight kiss before we went to bed

Oh the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

When daddy left then destitution came upon our family
Not one neighbour volunteered to lend us a helping hand
So just let them gossip all they want she loved us and she raised us
The proof is standing here a full grown man
Last summer mama passed away and left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is more than grateful for their birth
Each Sunday she receives a big bouquet of fourteen roses
And the card that reads the greatest mom on earth

Well the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger

With everybody backing down

And all at once you forget to try

I'd go there if you let me,
They're never gonna find me now

And in and out of doubt

Your not coming back for me, these things they will never be
I'm so used to being wrong, so put me where I belong

I'll get back to you,
God knows I try,
But I still lose
And I get back to you,
These days run by,
But I still lose

They give and take like a vicious lover

When all this loses meaning,
You'll never want it back somehow
Awake but still I'm dreaming
And never waking up

More lost without you and so it goes

Dallas Smith,"In a cloud of dust, I picked you up off your front porch
My old truck was lifted
That summer dress messing with my head
Caught the wind just a little bit and lifted
And it sure felt good (it sure felt good)
You were holding my hand (you were holding my hand)
Looking out over that hood (looking out over that hood)
Singing John Mellencamp

And we were high on nothing but living and loving
Running down something called a dirt road dream
Our own little world, one boy, one girl
Seventeen and riding that sweet southern breeze
Lifted, like a song from a choir
Lifted, like a flame from a raging fire
Lifted

First kiss out under the stars
I’ve kissed before but that ol’ bar was lifted
New spot, we found my old guitar
You’re dancing around with your arms lifted
And you sang along like you’d never be gone

And we were high on nothing but living and loving
Running down something called a dirt road dream
Our own little world, one boy, one girl
Seventeen and riding that sweet southern breeze

Lifted, like a prayer from a sinner
Lifted, checkered flag, finish line for the winner

And we were high on nothing but living and loving
Running down something called a dirt road dream
Our own little world, one boy, one girl

Lifted, like a sail in the wind
Lifted, girl let’s go back again

Come on before the thrill is gone
Can taste the sunlight on your lips

Goosebumps on our suntanned skin
Ran full speed and jumped right in

Nothing to lose except our clothes
And we didn't know any better back then
We just closed our eyes and we jumped right in

Blue up above us, and blue all around
I don't know what song it was, but I know it was Jackson Brown
And there in the twilight, we held each other close
I don't think anyone saw but if they did they sure got a show

Dallas Wayne,"Raeleen wheeler was the first girl I loved
Through the last year of high school, we were thicker than blood
Holed up in Mississippi, and starvin' for fun
We made love and dreamed up places to run
I was burnin' that summer with the big dreams I had
And the songs I'd written, well, the world needed bad
But a pretty girl needs more comfort and gold
Than a beat-up black notebook is likely to hold

Hey, Raelene, it's a wide world between pearl river and the bright L.A. lights
And if I'd done it all without dreamin' I'd still be in Jackson tonight

Hollywood hopefuls ain't an endangered breed
But luck is like lightnin', and it sure struck me
The hit songs, the women, the standing-room halls
And twenty years of hard labor, holdin' on to it all
Louisiana i-20 headed east from Monroe
A bus bound for Jackson and a homecoming show
Staring through the dark glass at the flat miles beyond
Tryin' not to look at a face that is gone

Hey, Raelene, a wife at 19, but I heard you made out all right
And every now and again, I wonder are you somewhere in Jackson tonight

Well, we killed 'em, we crushed 'em, burned the place to the ground
And in the dressing room quiet, I was still coming down
When in the doorway appeared an old flame, full-grown
Looking pretty as ever, and entirely alone
She said the divorce nearly broke her, she was learning to stand
And as she talked it came clearer that she wanted a hand
So I drew her close to me, and I kissed my sweet rae
And the miles and the memories just melted away

Then I glanced in the mirror, and in a split second's time
Just before recognizing that old face as mine
I saw a strange, sad man in a cheap rhinestone shirt
And a woman he held onto like his last hope on earth
He was worn and trod down as the road he'd been on
And his eyes were half-dead, lookin' too hard, too long
His life measured in nights that flashed and grew dim
Leaving no one really happy, least of all him

Then the loading gate slammed, and I let my arms fall
We traded numbers, small talk, promised to call
And as she faded from me, and the night closed around
I picked up a black notebook and I let it spill down

Hey, Raelene, it's a long way between the wantin' and the makin' it right
And if I was the one that you needed I'd never leave Jackson tonight
(Tag) yeah, if I had it all to do over I'd still be in Jackson tonight",Raelene Wheeler,2000
Dallas Wayne,"You can tell that I'm a big man in this town
And I'm the king of every street that I walk down
It ain't much to brag about, but it's all mine
From main street to the city limits sign.

Welcome to rock bottom, population 1
Just over by the mountain where a fool fell from
And if you're looking for heartaches, stop and get you some
Down in rock bottom, population 1.

When I said goodbye to her I felt so strong
I thought I knew my way but somewhere I went wrong
Now I'd trade this lonesome world to hold her near
But I don't think she could reach me way down here.","Rock Bottom, Pop. 1",2000

Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away,
And if you hear a song today.
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
 
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low,
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe;
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travlin' alone down that last long mile
They're sighin'
With all their trouble and woes
They're cryin' 'cause they all loved

Tenemos que recordar que no existe eternidad. 
Como el campeon mundial dio su vida por llegar 
Y perder lo mas querido en nada mas otro mas,

Si no me quieres dimelo ahora,coro, 
A mi velorio no venga a llorar no no,coro, 
Hay mamita rica,coro, 
Yo sabia que un dia tenia que acabar,coro, 
Punto final todo se acabo,coro,echa pa lante mama. 

Yo perdi lo mas querido cuando perdi a mi mama, 
Coro, pero segui pa lante y pa lante,coro,

Dalmata,"Si eva no se hubiera comido la manzana 
La vida fuera sin malicia y mucho mas sana 
Pero como esa cabrona se comio la fruta 
Por eso es que hoy en dia hay mujeres tan putas

Se visten enseñando los muslos y las tetas 
Se tiran de espalda y se les ven las nalgas 
Entonces dicen que uno es un bellaco y no respeta (seguro) 
Puñeta, pues a la calle asi no salgas (puta!) 

El hombre llega hasta donde la mujer lo deje 
Pero algunas se guillan cuando visten como fleje 
Y si tu les pitas o les piropeas 
Se encojonan pero como quiera coquetean (arroz!) 

Yo no sabia el talento que tenia 
Ella el microfono agarro 
Improvisao cantó flauta soplo 
Y hasta la melodia se trago

Quien lo dira que asi seria

Hey! pana mia usted si que sabe 
Y yo pa esa cerradura aqui tengo la llave 
Yo te lo entro como juan por su casa 
Y tu le das la bienvenida, eso duda no cabe 

Toda la noche tu lo sabe 
Sin perder el ritmo, sin perder la clave 
Te dejo loopiao el beat en repeat 
Y antes que el sol se asome 
Convertir en un exito mi nuevo hit! 

Vamo a bacilar dale mami no te enzorres 
Bellaquear contigo por las venas me corre 
No te quite dale dale fuego pa rompelo 
Dejame meterlo despues de conocernos

Subirte a la cima y las nalgas guallarte

Por encima, partiendo la tarima 
Partiendo a las gatas que se suben arriba 
Dentro e' la cabina ñengo los domina 
Agarrate los tobillos que te voy a inyectar morfina 

Secret weapon shh shh callaito que es secreto 
Apaga la luz que lo voy a meter completo 
Me dejas contento vuelvo y te lo meto 
Si tu me dejaras yo te lo dejara adentro 

Va a pasar el macho que yo rapido me empacho 
Y tu que que tienes cara que me vas a pegar los cachos 
Que me vas a dejar quidandote a los muchachos 
Despues le doy un jamakeon y me vas a llamar los guachos 

No quiero que cocines quiero bacalao gaspacho 
Vuelvo y me escracho, hize mal la tacho 
Si hay miedo me embacho nah de novio chacho 
Yo no te llamo nah por que estoy bien borracho

Yo se porque tu anda con la chocha apreta 
Yo la miraba y ella mas lucia, se ponia 
Quiere bellaqueo, ella quiere figa 

No te guilles fina rompe la rutina 
Y deja que el dembow explote las bocinas

Y que si quiere saranana aqui hay lana 
Y no va a faltar la marihuana

Y un g string azul 
Loca por montarse al audi hasta en el baul 
Me vio flaco y dijo que hasta le paresco cool

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

O meu medo é uma coisa assim
Que corre por fora
Entra, vai e volta sem sair
Não
Não tente me fazer feliz
Eu sei que o amor é bom demais
Mas dói demais sentir
Você
E não querer
É porque eu não quero que nada aconteça
Deve ser porque
Eu não ando bem da cabeça
Ou eu já cansei de acreditar
Ou eu já cansei de acreditar
Ou eu já dancei

O meu medo é uma coisa assim
Que corre por fora
Entra, vai e volta sem sair

Where the reefer at, where the reefer at?
Run me in the dime, not trying to bust my head
Cause I stays on top of mine (top on mine)
Cause I been ballin' since the days of back when
Niggas wasn't be thinkin' about drink no juice and gin (alright brother)
Niggas be drinkin' the Thunderbird or Night train
Lookin' for the right frame, breakin' like a dice game
Stackin' skrilla so I'm sippin' Hennessy
Lickin' shot after shot at my enemies
Boom boom recognize all pursuers been in the game for years
Cause I'm a sure connoisseur
Consume the blocks, drop off my rocks, the quicker a nigga play me
The quicker a nigga who drops, pops of the glocks
Not trippin' facial experessions, be shittin'
Niggas don't be hearin' all that in every city
Take a nigga out if you gotta on the day to day
Then parlay, ate a gator, parlay, to God nigga

It ain't hare to see, when niggas try to be like me
A true O.G., why y'all why y'all, gotta take you underground
Parlay all day with the niggas from the basement sound [Repeat: x2]

[Mr. Dalvin]
Watch out for I blow, swing low
Forget it, why y'all don't hear me though, I'm hittin' switches
Hoppin' like a 64, and I, thought you knew, what I can do
Able to leap tall building and run up to your crew (oh)
The underground stylistical, got more flavors than mystics
So lay back and watch this nigga kick it
Wicked without thinkin' of funky
But I ain't stinkin', I know I got you open cause I got why y'all niggas
Blinkin'
Check it out, you watch me devastate this track
I make stacks and stacks and leave niggas on they backs
Cause I, be a sharp shooter, intruder
Rugged and rough, poppin' off just like a lueger
Now how many niggas, want to get down, while I say
With Jodeci or the basement sound, around
I don't want to see, handin', my crew is deep and you know that we be bangin'
So give me a bottle of Boons so watch me load my gat
Start a war like Tom Barringer in Platoon
So, don't mess with this flow, Mr. Dalvin is gone like 19 nigga fiz-o, oh

[Chorus]

Come on get down [Repeats]
This goin' out to all the players
Shoot outs to the ballers
Much love to the hustlers (all around the world)

Looking nowadays, looking like it's gonna fade
See me, will you see here G soul
If he lose baby he gonna gain another dough
What a brother know, keep it on the low
That's what my grandma said it suppose to go
Feel the same, we toast and post it
And if it all work soft then we casper the ghost
Me and damn phone we capture the phone
Collusion, illusion, set it all foe
Plan with me, for your best, let it all go
The beach and the wind you blow

When I come through slow
In a six-four hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement
When I fall through the club
Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavement

If you don't work then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement
Real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me
Real niggas hit the pavement

I'm in a coke white BM, just clocked in at eleven PM
Uh, while I'm blowin' my millions
Most of y'all niggas probably going to bed
The molly red, coming back home with the bread
Handle my metal, Hansel & Gretel
Cheese, keys, breeze, it's settled
This shit hot like a pot

Yea, I'm searchin' through time and space
To find the funk
And reconnect the middle ship
Yea, and now this is quite some journey
Seven days of funk, baby

Me and Dane spittin' game, doin' shows overseas
Forty years old, have no fuckin' enemies
Check checker bo readear letter mo wetter
If you knew better then you'd probably do better
Act like you know
Know not, better know better

I won't be happy 'til my whole team paid
From my mama to my daddy, to my kids, to my wife
