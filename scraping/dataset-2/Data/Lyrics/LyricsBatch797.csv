OK Go,"So you were born in an electrical storm
Took a bite out the sun
And saw your future in a machine built for two.
Now your rays make me kind of go crazy
Shock and awe and amaze me
Just a ticker tape parade and me

But something was wrong,
Till you tap-danced on the air, in the night,
Screaming at the top of your lungs,
You said,
""Come on, come on.
Do what you want.
What could go wrong?
Oh come on come on come on,
Do what you want. 
What could go wrong?
Do do do do what you want, yeah.""

Me I was raised,
Amid the trickle down days,
I woke up numb in the haze,
And saw my future in a machine built for two.
Now your light,
Give me some kind of fright,
How did wrong get so right, 
And lead me stumbling through the dark of night?

Oh something was wrong,
But you tapdanced on the air,
In the night,
Screaming at the top of your lungs,
You said,
""Come on come on,
Do what you want.
What could go wrong?
Come on come on come on, come on,
Do what you want. 
Oh come on come on.
What could go wrong?
Do do do do what you want
Yeah""",Do What You Want,2005
OK Go,"True about my taste; true about my wealth.
The thing about St. Petersburg: 
I was never there myself, so come on.
Anastasia might have cried all night, I couldn't say myself, 
So come on, yeah, come on.

I appreciate your courtesy,
Your well-learned politesse, 
But you got yourself into your own mess.
You know the demon's in the design:

A good idea at the time.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at the time.

Now how it all went down, only Pilate knows.
All I ever asked of him is when the bars would close, so come on.
Yeah, come on.

Oh, I appreciate your courtesy,
Your well-learned politesse, 
But you got yourself into your own mess.
You know the demon's in the design:

A good idea at the time.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at the time.
Now what you gonna do about it?

Now, it's true about my wealth, and true about my taste,
But you don't need no help from me, 
You'll lay yourself to waste.
So come on.

OK Go,"Fingers blistered from the nightly scratching at the window
Which won't open far enough to let air in
The house wins, oh, the house always wins

Feral cats are screaming at the clouds beneath the window
With the cracks so small that nothing gets within
The house wins, oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

Telephones are howling at the cats out in the alley
And the window offers nothing in the din
The house wins, oh, the house always wins

Clouds uncage the car alarms to chase the cats and telephones
Fingers rake and rasp away their skin
The house wins, oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in
Yeah, you don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

Ice age upon catastrophic ice age of selection
And only one result has trickled in
The house wins, oh, the house always wins

If evil were a lesser breed then justice after all these years
The righteous would have freed the world of sin
The house wins, oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in
You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

You don't have to be sick to be dying
You might as well give in
You don't have to have lost to be lost
Oh, give in

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

Thousand Fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes

Invincible
You're invincible
That crushing crashing atom-smashing white hot thing,
It's invincible

When they finally come, what'll you do to them
Gonna decimate them like you did to me?
Will you leave them stunned and stuttering
When they finally come how will you handle them?
Will you devastate them deliberately?

Ob das Leben eine Scheibe ist,

Lieber voll verkacken als schon im Ansatz scheiße.

And I told to him all things intended to help him,
Especially that, simply because it was ending,
That that didn't mean she was always pretending.
Real happiness was there.

It was real love that they felt.

And she's got a smile on her face
And she's got a story you can't see

Driving us back from the Crystal Corner bar

On a therapist couch with his face to the ground

Close-up cameras were showing him crying
His red head and his red eyes

?Bout a boy being buried alive
From his head to his toes by a criminal
But with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyes

And there's this scene in the show

And they're dancing in front of my eyes
Is the queen informed of the flaws

Like a claw splits apart like a jaw, like an eye
And she asks me with a sigh

We were so far from right
We were using the fight
We were letting the light weaken it's beam
Oh, oh, is there a hand to take hold of the scene?

I wanted to smile like a glistening shot of a kiss
That's as sharp as a knife, the day expires
In the dry, cracked, trembling lips [Incomprehensible]

I lift them up to you, I'd like to bear witness to

And is filling the cryingest eyes
Gracing each face that is making the waste
That is broken as one's fairly fly

Love that is in us
Of that ol' cynical covetest, cancerous vibe
And a beauty that annihilates all life

Like it's lived in these nights, holding your hatred tight
Like a sign that should [Incomprehensible] you strong
When the doors are shut tight, I will dream you tonight
And my dream will just sweep you along

My head will burst, my life will end
So I'd like to start this one off by saying
Live and love

I was young and at home in bed
And I was hanging on the words some poem said
And thirty-one
I was impressionable, I was upsettable

I tried to make my breathing stop, my heart beat slow
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold

From a bridge on Washington Avenue
The year of 1972
Broke my bones and skull
And it was memorable

It was half a second and I was halfway down
Do you think I wanted to turn back around
And teach a class
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you

And at the funeral the university
Cried at three poems they'd present in place of a broken me

I was breaking in a case of suds
At the brass rail, a fall-down drunk
With his tongue torn out
And his balls removed

And I knew that my last lines were gone
While stupidly I lingered on
Other wise men know
When it's time to go and so I should too

And so I fly into the brightest winter sun
Of this frozen town
I'm stripped down to move on
My friends, I'm gone

Well, I hear my father fall and I hear my mother call
And I hear the others all whispering, come home
I'm sorry to go, I loved you all so

I'll feel your feelings crackling

With every single cell of me, I'm going to make you mean the words you sigh

That smile that shines from the glossy magazine that's stuck inside the Sunday times

On Christmas eve
With the snow set deep when we went walking through the pines
I had just been fired and her first offer had arrived
And the new year would see her flying far away from me

What's making all my tears 
Is taking all my fears away.

A creature crashing from a cage.
A shadow vaporized by a new sun ray.

As she's almost asleep on one side,
And I lie back on my pillow and ask what her husband is like.

And she says, ""I smile polite,
And I tip and tithe,
And I see the sights with a well-trained eye.
But I softly sigh,
Because I'm too much mine without him.

And I lie, reclined where the room is quiet,
And it's quiet at night.
The soft silk is fine
And the waves are white,
But the wind has died without him.

And I scream my smiles,
And I want my wires and I need my stripes.
And I read the lines until I lid my eyes,
And I'm losing time without him.
And I ignite inside
And I flash with fire
And I limp from life
And I'm blazing blind
And I'm surging live
And give up my mind
When with him.

Fades to grey, and is dying.

It's real and it will go away? Do you?

Do you fall short of all that's in your heart?

Do you watch the world get cold and crushed and small?

Okkervil River,"I'm trying to transmute tap water into wine
Out here, somewhere in this Las Cruces motel room
The floor and ceiling vibrate so I can barely stand
""Calm down"", says the Sky Man, ""you're injured""
I dreamt last night I was halfway up the ladder to heaven
And I shot up this morning with an attitude

I charged through the city and I wandered the streets
Trying to get answers with just my irresistible smile
Shouting ""who will provide the celestial blueprint we need?""

Echoing voices zigzag in the night
In and around forest-view apartments
To crack a bay window and feel the fair winds
She throws back her head and she lifts up her hands
She drives herself into an amphetamine madness
She says ""Tell me, just tell me I was right""
And she's taken all the wrong pills
Her voice begins cracking
Her eyes open, staring at nothing

Do you get what I'm saying?

I feel my heart beating
I wonder how I couldn't keep it from coming on
I want you so much in this wild desert heat that it's scary
But I know I have done so much that could be construed as damage
And there's something bad within me that makes me want to take advantage

When you're tripped up, slipped up
Blonde hair and black-lipped up
With all those silk straps round your ankles
I feel myself convinced we could do whatever all night
It's high time we broke completely free of all control

Hi there! How are you?
Well I feel like my brain just exploded

Tell all your girlfriends
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm someone
Tell them it's breezy and warm down here in this strange place
I will wake in the morning displaying the mark of a new man
Whose whole world has altered in front of his stupefied face

I recall when things were way more fun around here
But the Sky Man reminds me I'm almost a ghost of myself
It seems to me everything fine fell away
I've seen the forests burn and learned you have to arm yourself
It's gonna be a funky fresh Christmas and I dont think I can handle it
When there's so little dignity in anything

Do you feel what I feel?

And Christ, will you watch my back where I do roam?
To a room full of murderous boys with no songs of their own

I feel sick, I feel compromised all the way down
Like an eagle with all of its feathers plucked out

Can you see it in your mind?

I was inconsiderate and cold
But I can change if it's such a big deal to you
I watch the dying sun sink on those jerk-offs in their convertibles
I went a little out of control, oh, with the boys out in the parking lot
Loneliness blinded me, down in the peanut-shell bars

Wild wild nights, heavy romance
There was Percodan spilled on the dancefloor
There were corpses in plain sight and they were just walking around

And the good old boys on their leatherette
Want a woman who was down for whatever
I learned to be compassionate by watching those working girls smile
Heaven was lying 'neath my feet like some wall-to-wall carpeting
And sometimes I believe that there's actually no such thing as love
And one of these days I might not be so good to you

Can you see what I'm saying?

Come and sit where I'm sitting, oh darling
Because now I understand that it wasn't you who held me back
There were forces beyond my control and maybe I held myself down
All of that money it gets so hard to stay yourself around

But girl, give me just one little chance
Well, show me some trust again
I will sing your soul far away, up to a sparkling star

Where all our old frends will be waiting
Hold my hand and sigh in a soft whisper
That you don't just care about getting what you paid for

And on the day that I finally die
Well I just might start screaming
In the one private instant I cross over that unseen line

The last remaining species of birds will be singing away
Singing goodbye to my tastes, and my face, and LA
Goodbye to New Mexico and Texas
When I'm gone, I know there will be some things I miss
Hold me and help me remember

Cause it's almost time

We are born wired-up and our heads are all flooded with messages
That get harder to pick out, except at the start and the end

And you, my weeping friend
I can't wait to describe to you what I'll see up there
Though I'm sure it will be an adjustment
There are voices calling me from down the hallway
There are voices that filter up through the silence
And ""Calm down,"" says the Sky Man, ""you're raving""

Rain hit my windshield like an open hand
I headed north in a haze of speed
I knew exactly what we need
I stood in a church with a shield on the sign
The smell of incense in the aisles
I felt like a giant spinning wheel
And I know how the minister must feel
And when his wife takes off her gown
And then she lets her long hair down
Lit by the world that's going round

Okkervil River,"It's hard to be a human being
Just seeking, needing, feeling pain
From things you can't articulate
And dodging blame
And measuring
And hiding shame
It's hard

It's hard to open up your heart
And face the fact that you could fail
And show the world what you don't know
And let your long-held high ground go
So you get cold
And act a part
I get it, though
It's hard

A human being was shaped by God
It's just an ape with changes made
It crawls the Earth
It takes and takes
Just like a plague
But still there's good
Or even great
Can we escape?
Is it too late?

And I've got nothing smart to say
To wrap it up, to come to close
I hardly see beyond my nose
And I've got no idea of
What you've been through
Or had to do
Or rose above

I crawled up on the stage and felt so sleazy
But when I saw their faces it came easy
It freed me

You gotta lose some pride
But you can't be part of somebody else
Didn't they tell you, honey?
Alright

Just like you said about your old boyfriend
And how he screamed his wasted song to the wind

And also, you were talking about the teenage mom
The cellar stairs that she was crying upon

Said you could tell me about a pissed-off kid
Oh and I'm sure he'll be ashamed what he did

I'm even feeling for his desperate and doped-out dad
So dumb he doesn't know when he's feeling bad

My friend he told me that I can't depend
On anything that doesn't come from within
Oh but my God, how am I ever gonna help the world
When I can't even heal the heart of my girl?

I got a need that I just can't see through
I gotta guess that I'm exactly like you
And more and more I get a tightness 'bout right here in my chest
You lie in bed all day just getting depressed

Oh it's so bad I wanna break that wall
That always seems to cut me off from you all
Oh but I guess I should accept the way the world, as it stands
It's spinning totally outside of my hands
Lost in the stars, that are singing their light
Across a hundred million miles

In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born

Many mile's I am away
From the place I rode my pony
Through the draw

Where the oak and black-jack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze

He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart her love was as lasting as gold
As he drew near her window a shadow he saw in the shade

The night was as still as the desert the moon hanging high overhead

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile

Were at the best place around

Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

Pulling kids out the ground

It's the wind that slowly carries
Colored autumn leaves.

We practiced in a subway,in a lobby or a hall
Crowded in a doorway singing ""do waps"" to the wall
And if we went to a party and they wouldn't let us sing
We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom and nobody could get in
'Cause we were looking for an echo an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony a place we almost found ooooh
And the girls would gather 'round us and our heads would really swell
We'd sing songs by the moonglows, the harptones and the dells
And when we sang sincerely, we really sang it high
And even though it was falsetto we almost reached the sky
We've sung a lot of changes since 1955
And a lot of bad arrangements we've tried to harmonise
Now they've turned into oldies but they were newies then

Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testin the murderous master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin for a serum, to cure em

Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin

I'll grab and the mic and now I damage you  cut your whole stamina 

Here comes the medical examiner 

One verse then you're out for the count 

[Bring the ammonia] make sure he sniffs the right amount 

Wake him up and then I ask him 

Why did he intend this -- 

competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous 

Boy you shouldn't bother this 

Leave me alone like the [son said G or he'll be fatherless!] 

I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco 

Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco 

and MC's start to vanish 

[I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin spanish! 

Yo he wasn't from Panama 

I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntama! 

He responded so fast, you made me laugh] 

Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH [then I scared-his ass!] 

[Kick the hundred strongest rhymes 

I brought out the punk in him 

Caught him with a strong five deadly venom 

Told him enter the Wu-Tang 

Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring] 

I watch your ass take a big fall, why?! 

My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball 

And as you step up to bat man [I play the riddler] 

You try to do me for a rhyme [then I'll change to Hitler] 

Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin your fuckin ass stayed 

home and played [Yahtzee!] 

Or watchin Happy Days sweatin [Poxie] 

with Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and [Chachi] 

Wu, who? Me gettin wreck so I'm through 

Like a ten and a half foot, gettin in a seven [shoe] 

[Now picture THAT with a Minolta] 

Have your ass doin some Night Fever shit like John Travolta

Pass the Hammer you're broke down, niggaz grab my what what 

Can't understand it here's the panaroma 

[A complete view of how I defeat you] 

Should of stepped to those fuckin kids who tried to [beat you] 

Yeah I bust that ass before 

[You ran to Texas and came back but forgot the chainsaw!] 

And want to perform a massacre 

Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular 

Crush the person who did em, well you just better 

So I'm stepping to your [raggedy ass jetta] 

Put the pedal to the metal 

You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle 

as I [pass the bone, kicks your every measure] 

It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure 

[C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli 

Rolled up in a] Motown Philly 

[I used to write all the time when I smoked 

Grab the mic, then I kinda like went for broke 

With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps 

Lyrically speakin, three to four rhymes then choke 

Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this] 

But they still remains a-nom-ynous 

I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix 

Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks 

I teach the truth to the youth, I say [hey youth] 

Here's the truth, better start wearing [bullet proof] 

Arm yourself with a shield 

[Before you get trapped up] just like the Children in the Cornfield",Damage,1995

And used to dip your head in the water? 
Everybody thought you had it in you, you know 
You used to jump out the water

see'mon baby baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, baby, see'mon! 

Verse One: 
Superlogical this, superlogical that 
I detect a nigga dialect by the way he rap 
I elect myself President MC

Then with mathematics, not democratic 
static, topic, Asiatic

Superlogical this, superlogical that

You are getting sleeeeeepyyyyyy 
You are now getting sleeeepyyyyy

And sleepy, and sleepy 

Verse Three: Method Man 
This one here's for my people, my people 
Enter the 36 chambers, the sequel 
Part two, for me and the cipher troop 
With the Teflon lyrics that you can't get through 
With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what? 
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin 
Straight from the beginning, of the game 
All the way to the ninth inning, I bring the pain 
Dark like the midnight train on the track by the RZA 
Diesel like Arnold Schwarzanegger 

Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard 
The hardware, choose the hardware 
Ask you a question, test the Ason 
Extra extra, read the drama and thennn another one 
which you intrigue, do your rap fatigue in the...

[Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Approach the school nine thirty, you're late
This time happy the solution was my date.
Get in your class, walk to your chair
Pop is all you see and then occasionally stare
At the teacher, more, tune in to we're clocking ya.
Lean back at this girl kept clockin' ya hood
Simulated from a (sensimilia) blonde,
Tell the young girl ""Baby, you're the one I want.""
She doesn't respond, pretends to ignore
So you say to yourself, it be her old and sore mentally
Pitchin' lies, the aim on the board as hot and wild pussy
You cannot afford this
Oooh, what slim and trim was my inner friend
Dear, quietly I want him to know my boots,
To rap out loose in my class,
But I kept sayin' the size of my dick and that ass.
So I turned around to arrange a date.
Swinging episode, baby number one's gotta say it
She popped a gum, cold twist to come
I said ""Baby, how you feel?""
She said ""Sure""
Then I said ""sure"", I just found my thrill
Wear it in the classroom, know I'm Blueberry Hill
Cause what I said just bottled her hate.
She put her face on the chest, this is what the bitch said:
""Because of you I ain't hurting, but then my within my heart
Cause no, I'm not right to be flirtin, but our relationship has to start.
You're the one that I'm clocking, stop or you could stop mockin'
Don't want you to see me cry, this is why, this is why, this is why!""

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I met a girl named Chandra, from way down yonder
The apple of my eye had a Snapple and some fries
Forgot the catsup, that's when I pressed up
""I've been watching you mowing your lawn""
The thoughts were flowin, while I'm holding the palm
""Hey what's that on your menu?"", from there we continued
And talk about this and that we chit and chat
Sipped on the Coke then I stroked the back
As she giggled and I wiggled to the bra
She said ""nah!"", that's when I noticed her pah
Big Tank, who did nothing but the spank
At parties, drink Bacardi and didn't think
Just act silly, with his brother Willy
Another hillbilly gettin ill with the Philly
And moonshine, but it's a new time of day
On the stoop doing the Patty Duke
OK, it's like that old flip flaps through the shower caps
The platform shoes to Apple Jacks
Chub chub!!

[Interlude: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Yo, you niggaz, niggaz be actin like
They be lovin them, them them fancy bitches
I, I likes me a nasty bitch
Bitch that's willing to do anything at any given time
Bitch gotta be nasty 'cause I'm a nasty nigga
I do anything baby, I wouldn't give a fuck what it was
I'll, ah, anything - I'm a nasty motherfucker girl

[Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard]
I'm just sittin' right, in my class at a quarter to ten right?
Waiting patiently for the class to begin right?
Teacher says ""open up your texts, you! read the first paragraph on
Oral sex!""
I said ""Oral sex!, what kind of class is this?!""
Yo, next to me said ""what's wrong with you man?, this is a lesson that
Makes you feel fine, kinda ease your nerves and relax your mind!""
I said ""Don't try to use no hypnotic spell!""
She said ""Be my assistant, I'd show rather tell!""
My knees buckled heart started to drop
My dick grew to a size that my nerve couldnt stop
I tried to run! She yelled out ""freeze!""
Pulled down my draws, dropped to her knees
Ripped of my draws as if she had claws
Broke the rules that defined sex laws
She responded quick, with a slick, welcoming kiss and a ice cream lick
Oooh I begged, I begged, ""Easy on my balls, they're fragile as eggs.""

Where bluebirds fly 
Somewhere over the rainbow 
Why oh why 

Hear me now! 

Style funky, you know dat's me

Motherfuckers acting all rowdy 
I'm saying though

The whole trip that was never shown 
I'm saying though

as I detect what I wrote with my 
through the time that I spent, money that I lent 
rap records went up just to bounce 
then became a new way to get paid 
they said ""Rhyming on the mic is the number one"" 
Then a brother get the feeling that he want to play cool 
you discombumberated diabolical fool 
Hog-flesh MC, go play in the mud 
Another 20th century, modern day 
Cannibal, humanoid, underground 
chud broke loose from the god damn 
dope-fiend addict why you walk with 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
when the MC's came, to live out their name 
roast rocking rhymes that was always 
when I elevated, and mastered the time 
You was stimulated from the high post 
You got shot cause you knew you were rot 

Verse Two: 
You're not the king of the diss 
Youse a queen of a bitch 
And like a homosexual 
Your ass always switch 
Niggaz wake up in the morning 
You're ugly-ass Gods 
Got slob around your mouth 
Blue code in your eye 
You can't smile your teeth too gritty 
Can't even move, drawers too shitty 
(you know what else) You're shaped like a thistle 
The holes in your drawers when you fuck been there since 
YOU DUCKING SUCKING MOTHERFUCKING COLD-HEARTED FAGGOT 
Sperm germs on your worm DISINTEGRATED MAGGOTS 
Repeat your rhymes all the time like a FUCKING parrot 
Phony gold chains only rated two carats 
You tell your friends that your home is like heaven 
Living in the gutter sewer seven pipe eleven 
You wear your socks twelve days in a row 
Turn them on the other side so the dirt won't show 
Go to school, take a shit, don't wipe your ass 
Claiming on another sucka nigga in your class 
YOU want to BATTLE? 
Is it the pork on your fork, or the swine on your mind 
Make you rap against a brother with a weak-ass rhyme 
Swine on your mind, pork on your fork 
Make you imitate the brother in the state of New York 
Chain on your BRAIN, that drove you inSANE 
When you tried to CLAIM, for the talent and the FAME 
Not in the GAME, yet and still you CAME 
Suffer the PAIN, as I demolish your NAME 
Not like Betty Crocker, baking cake in the OV 
Saying this is dedicated to the one I love 
Not a swine or dove, from the heaven's up above 
When I rap, people CLAP, so the pushers they shove 
When I rhyme I get LOOSE, better than Mother Goose 
Rock the mic day and NIGHT, so you see I'm the JUICE 
Like the two-six-EIGHT, politicians demonstrate 

Outro: 
Now hold up hold up hold up hold up 
What y'all niggaz don't seem to hear 
Is y'all can not FUCK with me 
I saiiiiiiiiiid 
ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 
Can't fuck with me 

I want to give a shout out to my nigga Door, Door, Door 
Buddah Monk, Buddah Monk, Buddah Monk 
Yo, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack 
For the niggaz who's here 
And the girls who's out there 
Throw your hands in the air 
Cause this one is more fly 
Fly, fly 
Flyyyyy, flyyyy

BZZZZT 
Wooo! 

Get your ass in the house boy, I told you 
Get your ass in the house! Get, get, in the god damn house boy!

I didn't mean nothing by it 
But when it come to... Fucking with you MC's",Harlem World [*],1995
Ol' Dirty Bastard,"My beats are slammin...  

My beats are slammin' from the rugged programming 
My man Bob Marley hey my man I'm Jammin' 
You could never touch the stamina, while I'm rammin' the 
hip-hop crowd makes me rrrah rrrah rrrah 
Other MC's got flipped with the ease 
Beggin' me for burnt cigar, stop the music please 
No, cause I'm a PRO, rap to the convo 
Make a crowd say HOE, at a strip show 
Represent, my name is Ason, keep calm 
Rhyme's too smoky, funky like a stink bomb 
Boom! Blowin' up niggaz better than pullin' the trigger 
So you betta run for covah! 
Niggaz better loosen they ass, felt the glass 
A forty ounce bottle, yo yo yo yo money yo pass! 
Woooh-woooh-woooh! I sweat it live 
MC gonna live God? No, the nigga die 
The maximum of MC's are populating 
The minimum of those MC's are dominating 
Now all and together now, to what what who?

Hippa to da hoppa and you just don't stoppa 
Hippa to da hoppa and you just don't stoppa 

Ah shit, here I go once again 
Rhymes get shitty from the time that I spend 
I come old like toe fungus mold 
Ask my grand-pop pop duke gave my soul 
Then I came with that old Al Green shit 
Saaa-die, taught me the ballisitc 
I get you blurry in your eye with a high note 
down, to the Brownsville, oops you got smoked

So I didn't get burnt one time I got burnt actually two times 
When you really look at it 
Yeah, I love the girl but I had to cut the bitch off 
Yeah the bitch died, I killed the bitch

By Blowfly, and I want all y'all to hear this shit 
It's just a poem that I writ for you girl

See them knows that this is something you can't fuck
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan

His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like, mail, pre hands that be the move

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it
Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant

Relaxin sittin back sellin good tracks and
Again and again when I rock the jam

Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?

	He was known as the snake spirit
	He had the speed of a snake

[Intro/Verse One: Killah Priest]
Niggaz is like serpents out there
[snake style, no one could compete]
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo

It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He was just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standin when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors, by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we plan to make grands of our home
[Number two]

[Verse Two: The RZA]
Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manor
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggaz he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggaz be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot

[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S.
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
in his country, even though he sold mad weed
for the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggaz actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
at the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the CREAM
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggaz I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
without a doubt, niggaz who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
and you don't know no fuckin lessons?

Ol' Dirty Bastard,"What's yo' name? 
What's yo' naaaaaame? 
My name is, Ol Dirty Bastard, and I'ma alkaholik 
Yeah me too nigga 

You're now rockin with Tha Liks so start reachin' for the ozone 
I see some girls I know but y'all look different with your clothes on 
What's up though, Tash came to steal it like the Grinch 
While I'm leavin' niggaz puzzled like I said my shit in French 
But it's all Olde English that I'm bringin' from beneath 
Try to bite my style on wax and watch these lyrics crack your teeth 
Cause I make words Connect like Westside when I test glide 
My drunken lyrical hanglider, nobody's tighter 
Than a ruff rap provider, with ninety ways to peel ya 
So I know the three words (Tash'll kill ya) sound familiar 
I filter out the weak every time I speak 
I drink to hit the peak to make my mind go (beep) 
I'm def-da-fyin, you rappin' like my client 
Tryin to scrape me for the style that slam harder than Kobe Bryant 
Be quiet! This is Likwidation from the West 
Motherfuck ya boozy show, I got my own special guest 

Yo, yo, breaker breaker breaker one-nine 
I bust this bitch in the behind with the silver shine 
Cause she thought she was fine 
She winked at me, I thought it was fine 
This nigga poutin', this hoe was mine 
I had the alcohol in me, took my time 
Let a nigga ro-tate turn on the table 
Put in the diamond needle, pull it to your ego 
What? You the king in the chair on my ground 
The Tyson of sound, it's twenty seconds to a round 
Scavenger nigga, youse a shrimp, a full line of shit 
My ear can't digest it 
Stop drinkin' all that motherfuckin' water, let's take it to the land 
So I can Godzilla up your sheeit, Mr. Tiny Tim man 
Niggaz be creepin' up my beanstalk 
When I start to come down on your fuckin asses 
Try to chip shit on up, get these nuts 
Motherfucker what!! 

The Ro pimped the flow like a hoe, so I should rap on the mack-raphone 
My rhymes hittin' hard enough to crack a bone 
I divide square MC's like math 
Bend you in half and drink a Genuine Draft 
I stop him, then I skied out with all wampum 
When he's layin on the ground, I let my Dog Scrilla chop him 
(Switch reels) I feels its all about skills 
The outcome's unbelievable like Tyson/Holyfield 
Your lyrics are loaners return em to they rightful owners 
My style is wild, like G's or the pistolas 
No need to ask, I put you on like a ski mask 
We can Fight the Power like this was P.E. class 
I Bomb Squads like Hank Shock 
Peace to my nigga Scott puttin' stickers on the block 
I drink more Brewsters than Punky 
It's the further adventures of the hip-hop drunkies 

You bithces are hoes 
Put it in ya like my motherfuckin hoe 
Or in your butthole/earhole 
Whever the fuck it goes 
(repeat 2X) 

Yeah, yo, yo, yo 
No disrespect to any architect 
Who tried to perfect, oh what the heck 
I'm a MC director, rhyme inspector 
Rated top ten, Brooklyn borough sector 

Its the Packtown original be-boy I'm rappin' 
What's happenin', so dope got the pope clappin' 
I'm smackin', on some chicken, what you kickin' 
You trickin', while I'm vickin' hoes you stick your dick in 

Step outta place, Tash'll smack your taste out your face 
Cause there's nowhere to hide unless you move to outer space 
Cause I waste motherfuckers like toxic fumes 
So you betta (make room) when you hear the (boom boom) 
 
Hey sugar plum, how can you assume 
That the pitch of the volume, doesn't have no tune 
I'm not your everyday, regular rap star peddler 
One on one at your rap seminar 
Beware of the hard way, three's the hard way 
At you fuckers 

So aiyyo, my name is J-Ro 
And my style is so dope they call it ya-yo 
I don't rap fast, I love green grass 
Nuttin' nice on the mic, call me a mean ass 

Extra da-llama, bring hahaha 
Extra extra bring the da-llama 
Verse a better one, then slice-a-versa 
God acre, massacre murdered 
Also known as a rap wrecka, not a rhyme rebel 
You're just rhyme to survive streets 
True beaters, minerals and rhymes survive lyrics 
Like the acre without the attic, but not the only Asiatic 
True God but my dick is my lightning rob 
Hoe don't kick that mumbo jumbo

See this the type of shit niggaz don't try at home 
I come funkin' up the spot like Micheal Jordan's cologne 
With the megadrunken, style to keep the crowd pumpin' 
Niggaz lookin' at me like, 'Tash is up to somethin' 
(Get drunk and I stumbled) but I didn't come to trip 
I came to bring it to ya humb-le 
Tumb-le all your plots and all your plans 
Ol Dirty's in the house and that's my motherfuckin' man!

King Mu'tazila  
Landed on a sick canvas  
now I roll his dead planet  head bandaged  
sent through the god's commandment  feel me.. 
I move through the dark rages  and won't stop until your ?  
until your bleedin'  until you stop breathin'  
giving careers a severe beatin'  for emceeing  
it's something that I don't take lightly  how the fuck you ever fight 
me, 
to a duel, I drool, before I break through, then I drag emcees, 
beat um' down to their knees, grab their necks and squeeze!, 
till there's no life left, they lifeless, they micless, 
what a crisis, I give them a good nights rest, 
I break they biceps, and triceps, thighs and necks, 
breast area, is the best area, before I bury ya, 
I make sure that you never, ever, ever, ever, try that shit no more, 
know what I'm sayin', (word is bond), no ambition, 
put you in that fucked up condition, leave you with your own 
conviction, 
shit was non-fiction, now you in a state of non-fiction, 
make you beg for mercy, if you ever approach me, I blow your head off, 
when I talk, chop off your arms, and bash your head in, 
you know where this shit is headin', for a dead-end, 
stop your sweatin', like Otis Reading, got your pants wettin', 
snuck up on ya a wedding, at your honeymoon, turn that shit into doom, 
turn your rap cassettes, into your a fucking caskets, you god damn 
bastards, 
lyrics I mastered, rhymes burns like acid.. 
[ODB] 
I'm a complete analyzer of your entire eye, 
gave ya the tone to tour, to walk on by, 
I'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie, 
so good to you why?, yo! question to you why? 
the wing to your fly, bone to your high, 
the dirt dog, I be the god, 
the tear to your cry, I drop in it, cleanse the Earth's, 
my place to burst from, gave me the eye.. 
[Killah Priest] 
They made a braid to grave, ceremonies, from religious cults, 
half man and half goat, tomorrow hopes, based on the horoscopes, 
we followed goats, our nose and hella smoke, 
fire breathin' dragons, I rubbed the gold lantern, 
to the see the future, through the crystal ball, 
the triple walls of fisher wants to miss the fall, 
offence, see the coffin, often, fell at the doorstop, 
coughin, I heard the pipe organ (cough), saw some men of a white 
origin, 
I saw Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush, 
bare foot, sucking from the titties of a wolf, 
upon the braisen altar, 6 men offer they only daughter, 
splashing holy water, I ran for the, camcorder, 
now I play with curses, I roam the Earth's surface, 
snatching purses, allergic to catholic churches, 
what's the purpose, religious worship, is worthless, 
I visit ancient sanctuaries, where the saints were married, 
but now they buried 'cause of Satan's fury, I faced the jury, 
held in court, like Christ nailed to a cross, confront my knowledge, 
like Christ in front of Pontius Pilot, days are violent, 
standing in a haunted palace, the government wants my wallet..

That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Some got hopes and dreams
We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'mma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

From one corner to another, uh-huh

One, two
And you don't stop
Yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets

Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
Kick your balls like Pele, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K. to Cali

Coming from afar

Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

Well I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, 
I'm hanging out partying with girls that never die
The C.O picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

Allah masters the beat back
The crowd look, while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed

Broke this rhymin' video
Verbal assassin, blastin'
Exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously

Game controlled, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable, long-life cover
Very similar to no other

I seen a million tryin' to set a flow, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual thing forgot the Fri show
Now his pursuit is not for digress

A special note, thanks for being flank
While journalist's stay runnin' in front of tanks
Blew out first class, came back close cash
Ruff class, surfaces with no math

Beat Crazy Eddie insane

Used to be a hon' until she started gettin' high 
The high school prom queen, now she prom fiend 
Her man was 85, so he sold her a dream 

Told her he was rich, so she sucked his dick 
Swallowed all his cum and she didn't even spit 
Suckin' him off in the whip, he loved that bitch 
He loved that bitch.. he loved that bitch 

[Chorus: x3] 

I know this nigga on the Hill who got mad mils 
Some masses, got credit cards, I mean this nigga got big bills 
Well, anyway, I'ma sick him 
'Cause his girl Dawn put me on to the whole ? 

She say he don't be home to caress her 
So I undressed her and made her feel better 
He got the safe in the basement under the cemented floor

Ol' Dirty Bastard,"[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This recording is Dirty and it's Stinking
Funkier than Peppi Le Pew so I was thinking, about
Dropping this single on the charts, letting ya know
Hey, the kid has heart, I never deny myself as being
Dope, but in my last jam, niggas slept on my notes
You thought that I was weak? Huh? Let me speak
My rhymes come funkier than ya grandfathers feet
So listen mister, don't you ever forget
The rhyme is dirty, you couldn't even clean it
With Comet, for even Wolrex, some tried Ajax
Only mix with the best, forty-eight tracks
Yo, I get down with the Ason sounds
Lyrics that be flowing from miles around
So let the music shut ya ass up, then feel the uppercut
Now I make ya fall to ya butt

[Master Fool]
Ho-ho-hold up, Master Fool
Takin' it on down, jugga-jugga-ju
Fall on ya butt, ya ass goin' hurt
They call us wingworm'cause we mastered this dirt
I act like a drunk but I'm out for the dough
I mastered the funk, Dirt mastered the ho's
Only Master play the Fool, I worked hard and paid my dues
Tony Snatcher played the fool
And man meater eater played the bone
I come in the club with no ID
They gon' have to close the club up messing with me
Up, Dirty and Stinking stuff
It's that Dirty dick NUH with the Stinking nuts
Last Call now drink it up
Me and Dirt want a pound for some Stinking stuff

[Chorus: x2 Master Fool]
Last Call for alcohol, everybody out the bar
Get ya back up off the wall
People, oh, oh, people oh oh

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, let me continue, verse number two
Style is wild, dirty and stinking like doo-doo
If ya hanging around, ya changed ya mind
It is a bad influence, but yo it's my rhyme
I sit down and I say to myself, 'Self
Yo, are you rated top the shelf?'
I drop the single for you to get a dose of
As I lay back like a pillow on a sofa
Getting paid? Yeah right, Willy
Why asking me, G? What? What? What? What? You know me
My mouth is sugar, sweet as a honey bee
Taste like a forty, Stinking like Old-E

[Master Fool]
Fool in this bitch, where the fuck is the drinks?
No open bar! Where the fuck is the drinks?
That bitch over there with her man tucking his link
All strip club bitches straight clutching his mink
Niggas official, big guns, waving the pistol
My dogs lookin for the brew now we biting the gristle
(Stop fucking with them guns son you playing too much)
Catch a charge drinking bro', I ain't playing too rough
Fucks! Lay in the cuts and hug the butts
Grab a big five whether you a scrub or not
Robbery, robbery, pop, pop, popping like a glock
Robbery, robbery, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner, to another, uh-huh

[Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The surpreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin on this cream
Who the hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic immunity, no time for a Visa
And just because, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin bygone be bygone, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the d-low

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes is sore, bein the senator
Behind closed doors hittin truth to the seafloor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open more and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets

[Pras]
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, dance around these fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater and make you do a pas de bourre
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, crowd yellin !Ole!
Who the hell want to see me, from B.K., to Cali
Come on

[Chorus]

[Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finances, losin bets in the horse race
Two faced, gettin defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin out
partyin with girls that never die, the C.O.'s
pickin on the small fries, my campaign tellin lies
Was just spreadin my love, didn't know my love
was the one holdin the gun in the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

Got two strike dog and five baby mamas
With new strain I maintain, I'm ready and willin'
to keep change on niggas brains to keep the blood spillin'
I hate it but it ain't complicated, it's real simple
Fuck with me and know you get a hole in your temple
I ain't gonna play you niggas, I'ma slay you niggas
Don't take but a few figures and a few new triggers
Mack 10 livin' legend, every West coast rhymin'
Straight hoo bangin' gangsta and all rhymin' sodom, it's bad

[Chorus x2]
[Royal Flush]
Shut up, let me talk for a minute, a lot of bull shit on my mind
Dealin' with crime, a lot of why'all dealin' wid rhymes
Stuck on the grind, crackheads cookin' my pies
Startin' off on the 1-2-5, the block's mine
Bucket the spine, DH tryna tap my line
Stop my producitons, want to know my money discussions
Who I roll wid, ""buy so many cars is he legitin' of my dick""
It didn't matter when I ain't have shit
They done watch me in helicopters, parklin' in my crib
All I want to feed is my kids, no time to do a bid
Feel me, I forced the whole guns a while for my ones
Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?
No school, no job, no bitch, no food, fuck that
Do what I do to make my shit true
And I make it hard on them boys who blew they cats charges
If I go to jail you know I'm blowin' on the Sergeants

Mama come to papa, don't it feel at home here?
All the comforts of it, you ain't got a care
Don't love me wit your heart, love me from a far
Now sit, look pretty like you came wit the car
Diamonds in the ear lobe, wrapped in the mink
Condo chillin, I be tickle pink
Not worrying bout the next bitch or what people think
If I say they don't exist, POOF the extinct
Mama - no! we don't need the drama
All we need is south beach, puffing on Habanas
You just strike a match girl, do your man a honors
Next week Cali, we up in Las Palmas

And put me on the stand
I deny everything
And lie as fast as I can

Ya ask me 21 questions
And I start to sweating

And I say I can't remember
Then you get mad at me

But you always talking
Boi, you always talking sounds like
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

Don't ask me where I'm going

You said you won't get mad
If I'm honest with you

'86 was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin'
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You be sitting in the country, with like 3 or 4 charges
Young when started, but I had a talent
To get this past and drunk, 'cause I took it as a challenge
The older niggas game me much as I can handle
Cop the eagle, started jackin' with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin' clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name's spelled right on my four finger ring

Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You'se a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real
That's a trick to try to keep you where you at
All content, while niggas ridin' Bentley's and Maybach
Think I'mma lay back, playa, forget it
First hundred G's, I see, nigga, I'm tryin' to flip it
And that's some real shit, not just a lyric
Drop a couple open cases, not too specific

From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme

Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties

Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on

Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screw face

Well, I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was

Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof
Cop searching the coup, I got some herb in my boot

When Wu is coming through, the outcome, critical
F***ing with this style, the outcome get physical
Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my g*******
Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins and minerals

Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team
Like Martin Luther King, taking one for a dream
I'm dope, too many fiends, live by many means
If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything

That's real s***, let's get this money real quick
Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this but I'd rather feel rich
I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now
Big Meth, the label's Def that's why I talk so loud, n****

Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit, yo
You don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing c****
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit

Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit, yo
You don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing c****
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit

F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f***
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you

Ol' Dirty Bastard,"[Intro] 
Dear Ol' Dirty Bastard, no no 
Dear, Baby Jesus, no that's not it 
Dear Dirt McGirt, aw yeah yeah yeah 
Look, man it's this girl that I really like man 
And, I want to get her to notice me 
So, I just wanted some advice on 
What should I do to like, get her to come my way 
Write back soon, your biggest fan, Rhyme-fest 

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard] 
Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup 
Baby just to let me down (just to let me down) 
Mess me around, and then worst of all (worst of all) 
You never call baby when you say you will (when you say you will) 
But I love you still, I need you! (I need you!) 
More than anyone darlin' you know that I have from the start 
Build me up (build me up) 
Buttercup, don't break my heart 

[Rhymefest] 
Look, c'mon 
Have you ever met a girl, come into your world 
Cat put your brain on sterile 
Activate and leave stains like curls 
Sophisticate, and make you feel so world 
Ah, there it is, so liberated 
Ridin' in a sports car, so ventilated 
Joggin' in a sports bra, so titillated 
Chick so cool, but not refrigerated 
Look McGirt, I don't wanna trouble ya 
But this chick on my block, I'm in love with her 
I wanna get up in her Bush like Dubya 
Tryin' to get up in her Bush like Dubya 
So write me back, let me know 
How I'm supposed to hit it when I got no dough 
How I'm supposed to spit it when I got no flow 
Shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy ya, shimmy yo 
Oh

[Chorus] 

[Rhymefest] 
I just wanna talk to her 
But I'm me and this girl is so popular 
It's a dirty game, me has binoculars 
From a distance I just started watchin' her 
Then I met her at Hills on the Southside 
Bought her chicken and fries, with coleslaw aside 
She ain't say thanks enough, that's all pride 
I don't care about her man, I just let it slide 
I just think about fuckin' you everyday 
And just sink in the back of my Chevrolet 
All that chicken you ate and you never paid 
Take my order, can I have a breast or leg? 
Would you fin' to say no, oh, how's that so? 
After I came here and spent all my dough? 
""Look boy it's chicken, what is you broke?"" 
Then I got scared and said it's a joke 
Gave her a hug and stole her coat 

[Chorus] 

[Rhymefest] 
Dear Dirty, thanks for the advice and everything man 
It didn't really work out with this chick this time 
She wasn't that buttercup, she was just another slut man 
But you know what? I'm just gonna say forget about it man 
I'ma go get a movie, you haven't seen ""Harry Met Sally"" yet? 
It's kinda like what I'm goin through, aww, whatever 
C'mon! 

Yeah 
This is for everybody lookin' for that perfect girl man 
Sometimes you ain't got all the money in the world 
And you ain't got all the looks in the world but 
You can still find that buttercup 
Don't let her build you up and break you down man 
You build it up, whatever, yo freak for me 
Make sure she like to fuck though, heh 
That's always important isn't it? 

[Ol' Dirty Bastard] 
Expect you're the one for me

[Rhymefest] 
Yo Dirt, pack your bags, let's go

Ol' Dirty Bastard,"Yeah, now we're gonna give a shout out, knowumsayin'? 
Def Jam, knowumsayin'?

Say all the artists here, knowumsayin'? 
Bacon Lot, knowumsayin'? 
I don't need no introductions, Cat 
Whuuuuut 

I'm sittin' in my west, I'm analyzin' thoughts 
I'm sippin' off a quart that I just had bought 
I'm thinkin' of the moment, things soar in that head 
I feel assurin' durin', also glad 
Yes, feel assured by knowin' I won 
'cause there's no one who can fuck wit A-Sun 
I'm not bein' pushy but I'm born to boss 
You need A-Sun, oh yes, well of course 
Don't see the riot, everyone keeps quiet 
If you don't believe nigga, get hyper and try it 
Yes it is me, a total fresh MC 
Yo, I'm born to be, MC history 
Rhyming on time because that's the deal 
You're only as fresh as your ass feel 
Other MC's, you are bound to fall 
'cause your real world is not a world at all 

1 - Drunken Master, styles causin' street disaster 
Blaze cut faster than a fairy slasher 
Tai-chi, Kung Fu fighting, ODB hands quick as lightenin' 
Techique too deadly 
Iron fist blew the pawn, switch styles like lay long 
Let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout 
Shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxegen, try again 
When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in 

Approach the mic slow, it's about to blow 
One foot crow crane, anti-chain movement 
Restore the ming, some take this thing for joke 
Serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork 
He's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene 
These cats over here got glock holdin' him down 
These niggas scheming, I'm seeing everything 
Ten steps ahead, on the wall smokin' my 
Agent high told best friend of the wine 

Still drunk offa cheap wine 
Holdin' front lines, niggas want to front, fine 
Fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine 
Swine nigga's come as hard as a pork rind 
Can you dig it? Only five percent live it 
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it 
Now fuck around 

Repeat 1 
Down wit the all and together down crew 
The jizza, the rizza, me of course too 
The thing I'm analyzing is strickly Hip Hop 
That's what's made, well made is on my workshop 
You was unable plus earn advance 
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance 
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost 
Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost 
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype 
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics 
I became a wrecker through my amplifier 
Break it down base, treble through my dancer 
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music 
It's not classic, arabic, or basic 
It's strickly thickly, dirty and districkly 
If not don't you pick me and forget me 

Repeat 1",And You Don't Stop,2007
Ol' Dirty Bastard,"I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MC's looking out
I drop science like Cosby dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
Ason, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastycake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit blaow
Not seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger
I said ""Get the fuck outta here!""
Nigga wanna get too close, to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing - yo fuck that nigga's name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MC's I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Blown to death
You got shot cause you knock knock knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hard rock
Slacking on your macking cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back

It's Ol' Dirty Bastard and shit, know I'm sayin?
I wanna give a big shout out to my nigga Luke
KnowI'msayin? You know, you know, know
I wanna lock all the bitches down
I wanna lock all the bitches down from the North,
To East, to West, to South

I wanna.. help me put these bitches in my trance
I want y'all to suck my lizard
You bitches wanna fuck me when you smell my under-arm

[ODB]
I make yo' dick disappear
I ain't hearin anymore weird sounds in the ear
PSSSSSSS... you can't purr no more
You wanna kneal and suck dick? I'ma keep your throat sore
Bitches got herpes in ya ass
Every time you fuck a nigga, he dies fast
And you won't last
The pussy break down from a rash
It's hard for you to walk, 'cause you stuck up in your ass
Don't ask me for no cash
You better not be tellin me to give them no cash
Ash, bash, crash, sad ass

[Chorus: ODB]
Give me a little of that Cracker Jack
You ain't caramel coated Cracker Jack
The surprise, bitch you gonna get waxed
This that shit, you can't do nothin about

Girls ain't pretty to me anymore
'cause you ain't bein a real whore
Ooh, you ain't a real whore
[yells some crazy shit]
You can't say, wear nails anymore
You ain't givin up, a manicure
Suckin my dick is gonna be your chore
If you don't, you're punishment
You can't get off until ya suck my dick
Physically I operate your brain to function
Give me anything, that I wantin
ALL GIRLS WANNA FUCK ME EVERYDAY
And give me that, the money
Don't even know what happens naturally
Especially when I'm playin with the chemistry
THE MONEY COMIN TO ME FIRST
You gonna keep dyin til you die from thirst
I WANT A DIFFERENT GIRL EVERYDAY
If you wanna die, you gotta drink my sperm
The other way to die, is eat a can of worms

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: ODB]
Give me a little...
Yo, I love you girls 'cause you wanna stick your tongue up in my ass
Or you can't taste, smell, touch or hear, or see
I got you in a smash, give me it!

Old & In the Gray,"When you're tryin' to make your livin' makin' rain
You got to put on a real good show, tell the people anything
You got to get the Lord's attention any old way you can
Maybe He'll show a little mercy and start cryin' for the lined

Rainmaker, rainmaker the land is parched and dry

Rainmaker, rainmaker make the Heaven's cry

Well, some say I work miracles, some say I'm just insane
Many a time I bet my life that I could make it rain
One time I had a whole town beatin' the drums
And singin' through the night
We watched the morning sun come up and not a raincloud in sight

I knew if I didn't make some weather and see them storm clouds gather
I'd be run out of town when the sun went down
Covered up in tar and feathers
I was on my knees and I raised my hands to the Heaven's high
I felt this rain like a sigh of relief come pourin' from the sky

Hey, hey, rainmaker, rainmaker the land is parched and dry

Rainmaker, rainmaker make the rain fall from the sky
(Ah, yes)
Rainmaker, rainmaker the crops are gonna die
(I'm a-talkin' 'bout)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the Heavens' cry

Let the cool rain follow on down
Let the cool rain follow on down

Sometimes I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse
Too little rain is not enough and too much just makes things worse
Well, the good Lord promised me a miracle in this life
With only one condition
He said, ""Take your money get out of town
Don't try and start another religion"", oh, oh

no different than you or I
He's catchin' catfish, and gettin' drunk
But Uncle Sam called, he called him up

Got his life turned upside down
Turned his smile into a frown
Robbed that king of his crown
For an ideal he didn't even know about

And he flashed that pen and paper
And ol' Flukie he signed up

Gonna be a rumble

you're in for a hell of a fight
Take it from the ones who know

Hurry up and wait, don't sleep late
And learn to hate your brother
Before you hate your foe

them choppers flew low
Glancing for the hand signal 
to tell you where to go

And they pounded his brain
And he thought about Eutaw and 
who was to blame
For sendin' him to Vietnam",Big Time in the Jungle,2004

How do you expect a man not to get lost
Every year I just keep getting deeper in debt
If there's a happy day, Lord, I haven't seen one yet

Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me

Land that I love is the land that I'm workin'
But it's hard to love it all the time when your back is a-hurtin'
Gettin' too old now to push this here plow
Please let me lay down so I can look at the clouds

Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me

Land that I know is where two rivers collide
The Brazos the Navaho and the big blue sky
Flood plains, freight trains, watermelon vines
Of any place on God's green earth, this is where I choose to die

Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me",Take 'Em Away,2004

To give advice at certain times
And tell folks what to do

What's the wisest plan

That you just don't understand, hmm

If it don't concern you, let it alone
Don't go around putting on airs
And meddling in other folks' affairs
If you don't know, say so
Mind your own business and let it alone

Them man and woman, say
You think that it's a crime for them
To carry on that way
Well, you think that you could stop that row
But just as you draw nigh
The lady with the poker
Strikes the gentleman across the eye

Let it alone, let it alone
If it don't concern you, let it alone
They know their business, all right, all right
They practice that way every night
If you go buttin' in, they'll break your chin
So mind your own business and let it alone

Well, you say that love's against you
And on your weary way
Well, lying in the gutter
A drunken man, we'll say
He's lying in the gutter
And you can tell that he's all in
But on his necktie plainly gleams
A great big diamond pin

Let it alone, let it alone
He's not your pal, so let it alone
The man is drunk, it may be true
But the diamond don't belong to you
So shut your eyes and eat some sighs
Turn around and beat it and leave it alone

Old Crow Medicine Show,"Well I come from the valley, I'm a rebel boy. 
Born on the banks of the Shenandoah. 
In sixty-one, I went to the war, 
To win one for Virginia! 
Ya my brother went first and they called me to. 
I was green as clover in the morning dew. 
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune. 
Carry me back to Virginia! 

Fire in the cannon, water in the well, 
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell. 
I learned right quick how to march like hell and affix that bayonet. 

Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 

With a sword and a saddle, 
Powder in the gun. 
We thought for a minute our fight was done. 
So they lined us up to the metals arm, 
And hammered us into the quicksand. 
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire, 
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron. 
Til the men took cover where the horses piled, 
Then we shivered and then hold against them. 

But the war raged on like flames of hell, 
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell, 
Dressed in rags and we ate that grass 
When they cut off our legs we cried! 

Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 

And they died in the valley, 
Died in the swamp, 
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped. 
Died in the ditches, 
Died in the fields, 
In the belly of a wagon for a woman's to heal 
Died in the war, 
Starved in the camps. 
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man. 
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend 
And to bury the tome of a-dixieland! 

Down in Alabama, 
Down in Caroline, 
Way down in Gerogie, on the Tennesee line. 
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee, 
Now we want to go home to Virginia. 
Say we want to go home to Virginia!

It was Gainsboro at the Glow Worm Bar
We were passin' around a jug and a guitar
Virgil picked it like an Opry star
I mean the boy was on fire
I said, ""Hey Virgil Lee, where'd you get that stuff?""
He said, ""I don't know, I guess I made it up?""
Well sometimes an empty cup
Just overflows

And all that summer was fire and rain
Virgil Lee started nursin' the pain
'Til every one of them songs he would play
Was twisted, falling down

Like a old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut old hickory

Laid him out in his overalls
'Cause when you get too big for your breeches well that's all
Hung his fiddle and his flat top guitar
Up in the high school gym
Nobody remembers his name
And I can't say anyone's to blame
One of these times you gotta hear him play
He was the greatest that's ever been

You can fool all the jokers with diamonds
You can playboy ramblin' roots
You can lie like a penny on the CNO line
But the good Lord knows the truth

Just like a old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut
Old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory

Blowin' like a gale full of rain clouds and thunder

Babe, it's been a whirlwind

There were babies died and babies born
Flood and drought and world war
We saw the worst years and the best
In every town another chance
Try and build a winning hand
Even when the cards were stacked against
Oh and I remember why we dance
Gentle as a passing glance
The warmth of your breath against my cheek
Then hearin' that loud thunder roll
Arm in arm we strolled
Went racin' home down rainy streets

Sometimes I think that I'll never, (Can't) go on alone.
An endless fight, to look normal, to be funny.
I can only paint deadly smiles on my poor face,
My poor face...

How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will we live?
How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will I live?

I'm so angry with you,
How could you
Hide your pain this way?

I'm so angry with myself,
How could I
Be so blind?

Every morning the same nightmare
Won't I wake up?
It's the worst pain I've ever felt:
You've given up, given up...

Because you hated life as life hated you.
Like a nameless disease, like an aimless torture.

I have searched for answers to explain your suicide.
I've preferred the version of an impulsive act.

But you knew all this time that you'd finally go.
You've prepared your own death with a smile on your lips.

We lost a friend,
(A) part of ourselves,
It will never be the same!

Something has died
With you this day
We're the orphans of your smiles!

When he takes it upon himself with a gun in his hand,
Blinded by rage, infected with hate,
Know's that he's right and he ain't got time to wait.

There's a prince in the pulpit and he never knew a rainy day.
He's gonna send you to die and you ain't got much to say.
Sometimes I wonder just what's in store.
Is a Armageddon knockin' at my door?

Take a look my brother, tell me what you see.
If everybody's fightin' then how can they be free?
Tell me what you aim to do when it comes down to you.
Will you stand up for what you know is true?

That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)

Stop, Hammer time!

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, 'cause you know you can't (You can't touch this)

Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin', and endin' up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin', girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like im throwin' gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposi''n the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ""O"" that I snifed off caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating

Ole-E,"Stay up Hold ya head up
It's hell in the streets boy
Hold your head young nigga
'Cause it's hell

I'm sittin' in the courtroom, stomach full of butterflies
Somebody help me, cause my life is in the Judge eyes
They got me for a Humbug, and that's some bullshit
I should've listened to them preachers in the pulpit

Stressin' to heaven, seemed like I was born by mistake
While the races dominate, got me victim to the Legislate'
I'm playin' for kicks, hustle and rob reefer, it medicated my mind,
Fuck the World, with crime

My mamma died in '92 so crazy, what the fuck to do?
Daddy smokin' hard, not knowin' that it corrupted two chillin'
I'm starin' at the ceilin', can't take too many blows
The pain be killin', got the sinus up in my nose, oh

These people want to hurt me, my momma dead, so fuck 'em
A small timer on the rise, so nothin' I feel
To my niggas in the county, I might do a bit with ya
Boy, in the streets I don't care with ya, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

Now I was born broke, but I'll be damned if I'm a die that way
Love my momma, can't deny that face and as a child
Everynight I prayed for a rap record deal, man sometimes
Twice I'd say, ""Lord save me, take me away from here""

Twenty now, and I've been sellin' yay' for years
But why we had a house, and couldn't keep it?
Why we evicted? Why we get more pink slips than Victorias Secret?
Why I gotta rob? Why my pappa ain't gotta job? Why I ain't graduate?

Why through high school I ain't have a date?
Why I had to masturbate? Why I'm wearing hand me downs?
Why I'm in and out of jail? Why I let my family down?
Why my uncle died? Wish it would've been me

He ain't rob, he ain't hustle, should've been me
Preacher man, could you pray for me, faithfully?
When God comes lay him his herbs, tell him wait for me

What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

He just keep layin' his hands on my momma again
Family ties, this is where the drama begins
Tellin' my momma on the floor, bitch this and bitch that
Locked in my prayin' to God, ""Please let me get back""

He's trippin' like he's outta control
So he had to of been smokin'I heard her croke
Through the wall, she was gaggin' and chokin'
Eleven years old, and I don't need to be seein' this shit

But in my tape deck, eight ball talkin' about beatin' a bitch
It got me confused, but damn, you shouldn't popp her that hard
And when them folks come , her stupid ass be droppin' the charge
Whippin' her ass like a man, right and left with his fists

Heavely blows to the dome, now she slicing her wrists
I'm hyped and I'm pissed, soaking wet with blood holdin' her limb
It's gonna be all right, she whispered with her bleedin' lip
She passed out, eyes rolled back, I'm tryin' not to panic

Step daddy walked in, saw my momma, then he went in a frantic
Blood leakin', non stop, permanent rush with the fever
She almost died, of loss of blood, I knew my momma wouldn't leave me
She don't deserve to live in pain, she just wanted to be happy

Feelin' like a puss, I didn't help her 'cause he ain't even my daddy
She's back at home, and he puttin' his hands on her again
Livin' in eternal fire, where drama doesn't end

It's hell

Nobody knows, the load, my soul tow

We played with our lives before they were spent
We were young and unafraid
So alive together

We gave ourselves to giving in
And separated from within
Our only fear was growing old
We swore that we would never

And I remember how it used to be
Oh, I remember you were here with me

Summer of love came and was gone
'Cause we lifted up and tried to hold on
To memories of what we were
The times we shared were golden

And I remember how it used to be
Oh, I remember you were here with me

I remember cold Novembers
And when we used to laugh together
And I remember you

Here in my life
You were always
Here in my arms
You were always
Here in my heart

Like a story returned everyday
And my heart gave a warning
And it stopped for a moment
And I thought I would never get well

but the poison and passion and action of love
Running away with me huhh
The fighting and hiding your hating and love
Until you could set me free

I was caught in the middle of a rock and a hard place and
I needed a soft place to fall
Then you showed me the reason to rely on my feelings
I had nothing to fear at all

That circle of loneliness yeahh
I'll never go back to that circle of one

To escape to a new life
Far away from this merry go round

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh baby, let it snow, let it snow
I really want it to let it snow

Oleta Adams,"Dont know why theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I aint together,
Keeps rainin all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misry everywhere
Stormy weather
Just cant get my poorself together,
Im weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin chair will get me.

All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Cant go on, evry thing I had is gone

You're the cause of all my trouble and pain
Unless you're mine don't explain

My love, my love, my love don't explain
There is nothing with me not to gain
You know that I love you

Look at what lovin' has done
All my thoughts were real and so sincere
I was so completely yours

You know, I hear folks cha-cha-chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong right now doesn't matter

You're here with me, sit down, have a seat
It's your time to feel the pain
It's your time to reel, don't explain

I'm gonna skip ?

Oleta Adams,"Let's just freeze the frame, savour the moment
Never let it fade away
Let's just pretend there's just you and me forever
If only for this one day
Sipping Mojitos and listening to Miles, playing our favorite games
And later we'll count all the stars in the sky; 
There's one I want to re-name

I want to feel every beat of heart
Losing myself in your arms
I'll hold on to every kiss that you give
And wear them like they're charms
There's nothing important or pressing to see
Outside of where you want to be
Settle back, relax my de----are
Let's just stay here

Let's just see if we have a flying dream
In the middle of the afternoon
You can hop aboard my shuttle, so I can take you to the moon
And we'll keep soaring around and round
To see how far we'll go
And it's time to be homeward bound, we'll come down really slow

You can tell me your favorite bedtime story 
And never even say a word
You can write a brand new song of love to a tune I've never heard
The fact of the matter just happens to be 
You're the only one that matters to me
Sit back, get closer de---are
Let's just stay here

Hab ein halbes Jahrzehnt hinter Gittern verbracht
Und wie war's so? Paar Besuche mit schweren Leuten
Nebenbei spuckt mein Double den Vers

Hoch bis nach Berlin, du doof sag mir wer

Durch Vocal-Sessions auf Reaf sein Beat
Zu Top-Adressen in Übersee, pöff

Der typische Sound vom Lackschuh, wenn er Visagen versaut
Ohrfeige deine Braut, wenn sie frech wird, geh dafür in den Bau
Hitzkopf, kann keinem vertrauen
Dreh dir den Hals um, wenn du böse schaust
Mein Anzug (Guck ma') ist mehr wert als dein Lambo
Heb deine Hand hoch, mach auch so
Rauchen Knollen mit den Jungs vom Barrio
Fick dein Cabrio, Bratuha, muss mit Suchkas mein Saft teilen
Zu Pacs Zeiten lief der Scheiß
Baller weiter alles weg wie 'ne Tec-9

Als Messer, die nur blenden, wer sagt
Dass Russen im Benz fahren, während ihr nur lügt, macht es selber
Ich bin Slave, du Ratte, entweder nix oder alles

Jeder schenkt mir Joints, 10er-Packs, ich hab 'n Haufen Fans
Bekommt 'n Fressflash während der Durchsuchung
Hände zittern, los geht's, der Beamte holt den Spürhund
Hoffentlich läuft es rund und die Behörde macht kein' Pfund
Lass mir bloß nix anmerken und halt immer schön mein' Mund
Immer winken sie zu uns, frag mich immer nur warum
Liegt es etwa an mein' Haar'n, ist euch der Boxerschnitt zu kurz?
Auf dem Teppich ist Schmutz, er sagt, hast du den Koffer?
Verstecken Sie etwas? Ich schüttle, nein, mit dem Kopf Bratan
hab nix zu verbergen, außer Haze knollen im Airbag
Ich riskier dafür mein' Arsch, weil die Ware es wert ist
Egal, was jetzt geschieht, koste es, was es wolle
Los, Augen zu und durch, willkommen zur Arschkontrolle

Er hat's mit Koksern zu tun, eine ganz miese Bagage
Er ist wütend und schreit, Jungs, ihr könnt mich nicht verarschen!
Wie Sie seh'n, wir sind die falschen,
was ich hab, sind höchstens Pfandflaschen

Sorry, Herr Kommissar, ich weiß es ist strafbar
Doch letzt Nacht war ich mit Marocs auf Beyda
Schweißtest durchgefallen, Kokain im Blut
Und ja, ich geb's zu, ich war mit Ramazan im Suff
Ich hab jetzt erstmal genug, wurd die ganze Nacht durchsucht
Verflucht, sei der Bulle, der auf mein' Vater tut
So langsam steigt meine Wut, wie gesagt, ich muss weg hier

Noch bin ich im Hauptquartier, Glück hatt' ich gestern

Hier spielt man Automat, Automat spielen ist leicht
Werf mal nen Zehner rein, vielleicht wirst du reich
Sizzling Hot, Supra Hot oder Book of Ra
Ist sicherer als bei Deutschland sucht den Superstar
Boah, ich hab fünf Siebener bekommen
Und genau wegen dem Flash schreib ich Automaten-Songs
Jetzt wird gezockt, wechsel alles was du hast
Auch der letzte Cent findet hier seinen Platz
Auf dem Club wird genatzt, ich brauch Adrenalin
Meine Jungs sind von der Straße und ich war niemals clean
Automat is wie Magie, manche sagen es wär Sucht
Von Gewinn zu Verlust, Schein für Schein wird versucht
Ich brauch diesen Schub, dazu ein paar Batzen
Ich hasse es wenn Leute meinen Automat anfassen
Es ist immer noch das gleiche Spiel
Ultra Hot ein Jackpot, rein muss er doch mein Job

Materielle Sachen machen dich nur unbeliebt
Das beste Beispiel dafür ist, wenn du Scheine siehst
Erfolg und Ruhm oder Hartz 4 und ausruhen
Bis ich verstand ich muss endlich was tun, also
Schrieb ich ein Album und setzte mir ein Ziel
Wenn man die Zeit zurückdreht wurde aus wenig viel
Daraufhin kam der Deal, 385i
Cem, Celo, Abdi holten mich ins Rapgebiet
Somit lernte ich mehr als nur Schwarzfahren
Jeden Tag der selbe Scheiß, ich war jung und unerfahren
Mit der Straßenbahn ging es Richtung Stadt
Treffen uns bei Johnny, weil er Papers dort einzelnd hat
Es ist ein Teufelskreis, raus kommst du schwer
Machst du durch und lässt los sagen andere du bist legendär
Doch was die ander'n sahen, hab ich schon längst gesehen
Und somit lernte ich den Sinn des Lebens zu verstehen

Ein assiger Kavalier muss 50 %
Kaputt sein und zu 50 % korrekt
Assiger Kavalier, assiger Kavalier

Ah, sie sagt zu mir ich sei ein assiger Kavalier
Weil ich benutz das Handtuch statt das Klopapier
Tut mir Leid, ich hab Manieren aus der Steinzeit
Und scheiß dir morgens in dein Sandwich rein, beiß mal!
Echte Kavaliere heiraten Nutten, erste Liebe aus dem Puff
Erst im Arsch dann Zungenkuss
Bist du sicher was du tust? Welche Schlucha du grad suchst?
Eine reiche, eine arme oder Sharmuts mit Stinkefuß
Bitterbös, lügen bis der Kragen platzt
Denn bis der Arzt kommt, ist noch für 'ne Lüge platz
Was für Schatz? Schlucha ich bin Straße!
Die Freiheit, das Geld, der Moment an der Kasse
Was ich ja meistens so hasse
Sind reiche Faces mit Klasse
Die sagen, sie sind ehrlich und Masse
Alles gut solang ich rate, flüster leise in dein Ohr
Versprech dir Autos doch spiel nur alles vor

Assige Kavaliere, Alkohol, Liebe
Filme schieben, versprechen vieles
Wie du siehst, nichts davon ist echt
Eine Blenderwelt, in der dein Kartenhaus zerfällt

Ich erinner mich an dich wie an ein Mückenstich
Also überhaupt nicht, falls du verstanden hast
Es war nur diese eine Nacht, an der ich hacke war
Wie zwei kleine Casanovas ging ich los mit Brat Seryoga
Hinter dem Truck verteilten wir n´ Paar Deep Trucker
Gib mir Milch und Angus Wopper
Ich XXL Corba
Los pack die Koffer auf der Jagd nach ein paar hübschen Schluchas
Ja Bruder, los komm tu was
Sie tut genau, was du sagst
Doch lass die Schuhe an, denn du hast Stinkefüße Sharmuta
“Вот, залупа, плачет ”?“, думал я о ней, но изо рта пахнет луком”
Klopf bei Veysel an der Tür denn die Nacht geht jetzt erst los
Pass auf! Schwanz raus, sonst bricht uns Liebe Kopf

Weil die Aussicht reicht, ein Blick und man rettet sich

Hoffentlich mach ich was und bin da wo's nicht pisst
Man is' was man isst, kommt drauf an wen man trifft
Ob im Restaurant oder Wellness Beach, ich war
niemals clean, smoke Green Medizin
Komm rollt mir den Scheiß ein, ich hab's mir verdient

Sieh zu wie das geht, sehen und verstehen, lass die anderen ruhig reden
Leute fragen, Olexesh, wo bunkerst du dein Ott?
Bratan gut unterm Sattel weil da keiner drauf kommt
Ich hab einen ganz klaren Kopf, mir kann so gut wie nichts passieren
Außer wenn der Bulle mein Bike mitnimmt aufs Revier

Nutz die Chance, Bruder, Take it yours, erinner' mich gut an Oldschool-Flows
Manche sind echt, manche nur Show, der eine zu laut, der andere zu low, wow
Alles nur Platzpatronen, Bruder, Chappell, ich krieg echte Songs
Verkommene Rapper, die Scheibe drei, Text, Flow, Technik alles auf eins
Ich rede die Wahrheit, solange du lügst, authentisch zu rappen ist schwer für dich, was? Ich bin die Neuzeit pass dich an, oder kack ab auf deinen Schmodder-Drums
Dein Album floppt, verlierst dein' Job, dein Label-Boss ist nur'n halber Mann

Ich kenn' paar Bratans, nur auf Patte fokussiert
Wir sind gleich verwirrt, aber mach' dich nicht verrückt

Ich liebe Rap, ich kann Brüder glücklich machen
Indem ich ihnen kauf', was sie niemals hatten

Lieber Knast oder arm - Entscheid' dich für 'ne Seite
Oder such lieber das Weite, Leute sterben für das Weiße
Das Leben hier ist ekelhaft, es ist alles scheiße
Bruder, meine Jungs haben Häuser verzockt
Mäuler gestopft wegen paar Dinger Ott
Miese Geldkrisen, weil wir Geld lieben
Werden wir zu Dieben, bis sie uns wegschließen
Auf der Jagd nach dem Glück von Montag bis Freitag
Jeder will ein Stück, nur der Tod macht uns frei, bra

Nein, ich bin kein Gangster, ich fick' dieses G-Ding
Doch bleibe ein Junge mit Prinzipien
Mois, das heißt, fickst du mein Stolz, ich fick' dein Blut
Ich fang' dich nachts vor der Tür ab, ein Stich und gut
Eigentlich will ich lieben, denn ich fick' den tosenden Applaus
Frieden im Kopf auf dem Schoß meiner Frau
Sie sagt: ""Manuel, bleib', wie du bist, ich lieb' dich noch so wie am ersten Tag""
Doch ihr macht aus mir 'ne Bestie, die nicht differenziert
Ob Reden am Tisch und Stichen ins Hirn
Ich weiß nicht, bis es aus mir ausbricht, schreib' ich's

Bruder, das ist garantiert nichts für die Kids
Ich hab nicht mal eintausend Klicks
Macht nichts, die Hauptsache ist, dass du dir das im Benz gibst

Leerlauf, bis jeder Michelin Reifen platzt

Bin ein richtiger Chiller, wenn es losgeht, Bra
Sis Kat will ich groß sehen, Bra
Zurück zum Thema, Party auf Beyda
Ich hab noch nie gezogen, sag' mal, was geht da?
Einer liegt schon auf den Boden, Sis Kat, neue Ära
Keine Ahnung von GEMA, was des?
Wir machen Party in der Hood, was für Eintritt?
Jiggo, wenn du muckst, kriegst du ein Tritt
Ich hasse Partys bei Brüdern, denn da kann man nichts klauen
Ich komm in den Raum, OL ist schon am bauen

? 90er Killerbands
Vesh, das James Brown und Ray Charles
Assiger Modus, bis es tief in dein Hirn knallt
Funkadelic - Bewegt, bewegt zu krass, ey
Ich brauch' mehr davon, tanz' zu dem Beat und schrei
""Hey, ey""
Geh' mir aus dem Weg und sag
""Ey, Frankfurt ist im Haus, 385, du verstehst""

Vesh, Vesh, Olexesh, aj

Funkadelic, gefährlich, respektvoll und ehrlich
Ab und zu muss ich üben, aber wer tut's nicht?
Du kennst mich, hin und wieder immer mal hektisch
Man rappt nicht, wenn Masta spricht ""S.."" und setzt sich
Hässlich, dummer Wichser machst gleich einen Backflip
Warum kommst du auf die Party mit deinen Stinker-O-Asics?
Jurassic Park oder was? Nein, echt nicht
Hier geht gar nichts, du bist gay, Bruder, rap nicht
Funkadelic - Sieh mal, technisch drück' ich dich weg, Trick
Auf Knopfdruck darfste hören, was echter Funk ist
Endlich eine ganz neue Klasse
Zurück zu dem, was früher lief auf der Straße
Funkadelic, Fahrräder, Cadillacs, Big Butts
Lackschuh, Smokings, Beats & Drugs
Cannabis, Snoop Style, Electric Bass
Papers, Filter, fehlt noch was?

Olexesh,"Wo ist mein verdammter Hund?
Die Dreckstöle, ich seh' den jeden Tag
Samir, hast du meinen Hund gesehen?
Samir? Wo ist mein Hund

Seitdem ich 16 bin, kenn' ich diesen Hund
Ich hab' ihn damals eingetauscht gegen Piece und zwei Pfund
Denn um wie ein Hund zu denken, musst du hungrig sein
Fleisch liegt verteilt in der Stadt, also schieb's dir rein
Mülltonnen durchwühlen auf der Suche nach
Fettigen Steaks, Restaurantfraß, USA
Es ist früh für den Hund, Schnappen muss jetzt sein
Unter den Brücken, Blocksiedlung Kranichstein
[?] gegen die Zeit, rap den Rhythm of the Night
Doggystyle, ich bin reif, und ich weiß jetzt, wie man beißt
Sieben Tage Hungern heißt, dass man durch die Gegend scheißt
Die Marke, die am Hals hängt, ist mein Ausweis
Und ich weiß, dass man Steaks teilt, sich beeilt
Weil jeder Zweite kann dein Feind sein
Denn der Hund schläft nie, ein Hund hat kein Ziel
Zum Überleben braucht er nicht viel

Mein Hund ist schon fort seit dreißig Tagen
Ich hoffe, jemand füllt da draußen seinen Magen
Rennen durch die Stadt, Leben in der Nacht
Schau, was sein muss, muss sein

Mein Hund ist schon fort seit dreißig Tagen
Ich hoffe, jemand füllt da draußen seinen Magen
Rennen durch die Stadt, Leben in der Nacht
Schau, was sein muss, muss sein

Begeb' mich auf die Straßen, ich such' nach ihm, seinen letzten Ort
California Love läuft in meinem Kopf
Ich steiger' mich, denk' nach, so wie'n Hund mach' ich meinen Job
Bruder, hör' mal, wer da klopft, bin nervös, darf nicht nachgeben
Es kann doch alles sein, vielleicht hat jemand seinen Hund gesehen
Muss meine Runden drehen, ich rieche seinen Duft
Die Luft riecht nach Pisse, da ist ein Abdruck von seinem Fuß
Schrei ""Rolex, Rolex"", sag mir, wo kannst du nur sein
Mein Homie, Homie, hörst du mich, ajajaj
Ich erkläre dir Detail für Detail, wir waren jeden Tag zu zweit
Und jetzt alles vorbei? Nein
Er jagte, die Bunnies, die Zwannis, die Crackmummies
Die Schulden hatten wegen Big Pappen bei Big Papi
Ich such' ihn und jag' ihn, verfolg' ihn tief in den Wald drin
Alles andere wär Schwachsinn, man, ich muss einfach nachsehen

Mein Hund ist schon fort seit dreißig Tagen
Ich hoffe, jemand füllt da draußen seinen Magen
Rennen durch die Stadt, Leben in der Nacht
Schau, was sein muss, muss sein

Ja, Bruder, ich hab' den letzte Woche gesehen in so 'ner Tonne, Alter
Meinst du so, das war mein Son?

Ja, Bruder, ich weiß, ich such' den schon seit dreißig Tagen, alter

Mach' dick schnapp für den AMG, AMG
Baller' dich weg, A zum J, A zum J
Inshallah, Bruder, holen wir den Jackpot
Rap oder Crack, Ott, Drecks- oder Bankjob
Mit dei'm Hartz-IV-Style, Bruder, kommst du nicht weit
Du musst salutieren, weil ich komm' und zerreiß'
Alles, was du von dir gibst
Pico, wenn du Kombi nimmst
Musst du auch gerade stehen
Wenn du Minus gehst in der Spielothek
Mit der Irokese, schiefe Zähne
Musst auch baden gehen
Mit Beton an deinen Füßen
Du musst für deine Schulden büßen
Box' in die Fresse, wenn du mich anschreist
Baller' den Text für die Jungs in Frankreich
Flow' zum Takt und gib' dir 'ne Punchline
Fick' deine Macht, hab' keine Angst, nein
Brech' deine Knochen so wie Bum Fights
Fick' deine Ochsen, du wirst nie ein Mann sein
Denn du wirst nie ein Mann sein

Authentic, Banlieue, ich schlaf mit meinen Nikes
Zeit ist, das was reif ist, ja ich reim es
Facebook Post ist scheiße, keiner liket es
Deine Frau ist grad mal 18 und steht wie ne Eins am Strich
Wieso gibt's keinen anderen Weg? Ich hab' gedacht, die Hood ist rich
Abgefuckt wie 'ne Snitch, Taschen leer, ach du bist sick
Deine Welt ist wie aus Plastik, ich dagegen Realist
Und wenn was ist greif ich zum Stift, und wenn du willst gib dir auch Sniff
Zeig die Eier kleine Pic, eine Gun macht auch nur Klick
Trag mein Leben auf dem Stick, dieser Weg gleicht einem Trip
An dieser Stelle gibt's 'n Schnitt, und Bruder ja, ich bin gefickt
Und wie du siehst ist alles echt, und deshalb heiß ich Olexesh
Denn jeder Satz ist wie ein Schuss, und jeder Takt geht mir ins Netz
Und wenn die Hoffnung dich verlässt, schalt ich ab und hör mein Rap
Drück auf Play, Hör auf mich, dieses Leben ist ein Test, schrei

Vergib mir Vater, ich hab' zu früh Musik gehört
Der Weg hat sich entschieden, ich denk noch an den ersten Verse
Azad, Savas, Samy, Curse, im Matrix hat man es gehört
Ich wollte auch und legte los, griff zum Mic und wurd nervös
Auf DMX Ruff Ryders Beats, auf Wheelies durch die Stadt fliegen
Ich lieb den Scheiß, ich hol die eins, ich darf von hier nicht wegzieh'n
Ob Sweet Dreams, schlechte Zeiten, gerade jetzt muss ich etwas beweisen
Muss alles auseinanderreißen, lass mich bitte dir was zeigen
Wie man sieht du spielst in Heißen, Olexesh mit Taktik
Von Flow zu Flow, von Show zu Show, das Mixtape wird mir viel zu assig
Mit Classics durch Oase, Spür den Sand an meinem Fuß
Jeder kriegt was er verdient, und mein Backup will sein Flus
Wie ein goldener Schuss, der dein Leben jetzt entscheidet
Tragen haufenweise Zeilen, Nase hoch bringt dich zum schreiben

Schmeiß' die Platte in die Presse, spring' zum Beat, demonstier' den Style
Es gibt keine Cowboys mehr, weil OL alle weggestompt hat
Wer von euch will kontern, Bomben fliegen, es gibt Backenfutter
Ach, du kleine Dreckssharmuta, du bist hier nicht bei Yakuza
Hier fliegen die Kugeln scharf, mitten durch deinen Papko, Loser

Ey, ist es wirklich auch so warm?
Wenn du zehn Jahre rappst, macht das Ghetto dich zum Star
Warum lachst du? Ich mein' es vollkommen ernst

Nein, kommt niemals in Frage, ehrlich

Verlange von dir, dass du machst, was ich will
Ach, alles gechillt, was fällt, wird spannend
In den Felgen spiegelt sich der Sonnenuntergang
Der Pitstop-Schmock poliert den ganzen Wagen
Mit der Zahnbürste, ganztags weiter, was für Feierabend
Dran bleiben, denn nur so machst du Taler a la casa de la plaza
Weedplantaga, die Sorte ist Ananas
Smoke Marihuana, smoke, smoke Marihuana
Viel rauchen, ja, das kann er, pures Cannabis, chaba
Stopfe alles in die Keule, im Aufzug hab' ich Platzangst
Wo bleiben Bratans, wenn man Deckung braucht?
Wo sonst läuft der Funk so oft und laut?

Schulden bis zum Abwinken, jetzt wird's ernst

Schwarzer Benz war ein Track aus der traurigen Nacht
Meine Augen sind hellwach, vertraue nicht dem Schatten
Es fickt tief in deinen Magen und stellt Nächte in Fragen
Dieser Beat, er begleitet mich
Und zeigt mir, dass alles, was nicht echt ist ein weißes Licht
Nutten reizen nicht ich weiß es nicht
Mein Gefühl sagt mach es! 
aber eigentlich bringt mir dieser Joint auch nix
Ich muss was bewegen
Denn dieses Leben hat mehr verdient als Münder, die reden
Mutters salzige Träne berührt den Asphalt
Und wenn ich ehrlich bin leben wir kein Thug Life
Wir sind Blocks und Hartz 4 ist das Schlimmste
Pfand sammeln oder warten bis zum Ersten

Chill mal jetzt dein Leben, Mann, erzähl mir keine Scheiße
Denn ich hab genug Probleme, die mich jeden Tag begleiten
Und morgens werde ich sauer, wenn die Sonne mir ins Face scheint
Tag für Tag jag ich den Cent, das ist alles für dich

Bring Papers, du regelst das, das ist alles für dich

Kauf dir draußen Liebe, können Bullen schmieren
Haben Zeit bis sieben, lass dich nicht abschieben

Hey, Barbie, hast du zufällig ein Navi
Kennst du den Weg, willst du mitfahren nach Paris
Mach kein yazik, sei nicht so asi
Benimm dich, schmink dich, hübsche Damen stinken nicht
Ich entführ dich, lass mal auf den Eifelturm
Mit Jacky-Dosen anstoßen, morgens Klinikum
Keine Risikos, lass lieber Restaurant
Teilen das Steak, spülen runter mit Bordeaux
Misses, pardon, pardon, erstmal hallo, hallo
Achso, okay, gehst du trotzdem mit mir hoch?
Belvedere to go, alles nur Show
Dre bleibt ein Klassiker, immer lay low
Ich gib dir mein Wort, trau dich ein Schritt nach vorn
Ergreife die Chance, Gallardos am Tor
Flüster, flüster in dein Ohr: Ich war noch niemals in Paris
Und alles war gelogen, willst du trotzdem mein Haze

Gut geschminkt, sweet eighteen, keine Falten
Doch ihre Augen sagen, sie musste schon öfters saugen
Nicht zu glauben, dass sowas Schönes so oft fickt
Hätt' ich nicht gedacht, bei so 'nem Kindsgesicht
Dazu kommt der Strich, von dem ich nichts erwähnt hab
Denn nachts, wenn ich schlafen ging klingelte ihr Wecker, ring, ring
Sie macht sich hübsch für LKW-Fahrer
Dummes Miststück, ich wusste, sie fickt ihr'n Vater
Umsonst gejault, die ganze Nacht, es ging so Stunden lang
Vor ihr'm Balkon verdammt, ich dachte, ich wär ihr einziger Mann
Doch ist es nicht, schämt sich nicht, kleine Schlucha
Fährt gern mit dem Jaguar und kaut's den Bratans, was 'ne suka
Billignummer, trotzdem reizt es, Hose runter, ja, sie weiß es
Stöhnt wie 'ne Jungfrau, weil sie dreist ist
Sie weiß, dass mein Herz weich ist

Ich hab gejault vor ihrem Balkon
Ich dachte sie tickt anders mit dem Kopf
Warum war sie so leicht zu bekommen
Alles umsonst, denn ihr Loch, heute passt da rein mein' Kopf

Ich kann nicht singen, ich kann nur jaulen, verdammte Hure, schau mal raus
Werf' ein' Blick aus deinem Fenster, ich wette, du ziehst dich grade aus
Ich hab Rasierklingen im Bauch, am liebsten würd' ich meine Faust
Durch ihre Tür bohren, doch zu laut, kann ja sein, dass sie mal kaut
Führ sie aus, knock sie aus, geb ihr das, was ich brauch
Ich fick sie, weil sie von alleine Filter baut
Wow, was 'n Traum, sieht gut aus, gut gebaut
Ab auf die Couch, blaue Flecken, sieht aus so wie missbraucht
Und sie traut sich nicht raus, denn ihr trauriger Hundeblick
Lockt Männer an, wenn sie klitschnass im Regen steht
Ich weiß, wie sie ist, deshalb bring ich morgens Gras
Und wir rauchen ein paar Keulen bevor sie atmet in den Tag
Wie ein Smaragd, der nur hell scheint bei Nacht
Und trotz ihrem Job mich zu ihrem Mann macht

Was hälst du davon, gutes Geld zu verdienen?
Also ab nach Berlin, denn der Laufsteg erwartet dich

Eine russische Schönheit mit dem Stolz ihrer Stadt
Nein, sie schminkt sich nicht ab und erkundet die Nacht
Heroin, Tillidin, Crystal Meth hält sie wach
Angel Dust, guck, was die Nacht aus dem Engel macht
Gestern noch gelacht, jetzt schläft sie im Sarg

Im Jahr 1-9-9-2 
Zog ich mit Mutter ins Asylantenheim
Vater brachte sie zum weinen, leider war ich noch zu klein
Um ihn zu klatschen wie ein Mann ich muss verteidigen, du weißt
Irgendwann wurd' ich dann acht, und sie schenkten mir ein Bike
Ich übte damit hinterm Hochhaus vom Heim
Das erste Shirt von Nike damals 90 Mark im Karstadt
Weil's jeder in der Schule hatte, holte Mutter mir dann auch eins
Meine Mutter war noch jung, sie war noch siebenundzwanzig
Sie wollte, dass ihr Junge gut aussieht vor reichen Spastis
Ich bettelte sie an um einen Walkman
Weil Amel einen hatte, wollt ich auch mit ihm im Hof chillen
Die Beats, die er mir zeigte, waren krass
Marshall Mathers LP, auf B-Serie Sony Bass
Du teilst, was du hast, ich dank dafür
Wo wär ich ohne Walkman, für mich gab's diese Tür

I do hear and see surely I should run far from Budapest

Cave-accordions, they taste my flesh
And in fast motion, men are mean, mean, mean, mean and mesh

I may have a few contacts but no peace I could find
And the burning synagogues are lighting up all

Nada tiene sentido
Me falta tu amor

Apagaste la luz
De mis sueños
Hay un grito de alerta
Por todo mi cuerpo

Le suplico a mi corazón
Que libere mis sentimientos
Yo no quiero decir adiós
Y yo se que con él no cuento

Te recuerdo, me estás diciendo
Que yo estoy perdiendo el tiempo
Es un hecho que sin ti, no se quien soy

El papel de malo no

No te queda nada bien
Ojála y tu orgullo
No acabe con todo

El papel de malo no

Puede resultar fatal
Te pido vuelve
Es urgente que sepas
Que aún me siento tuya

Cada vez cuesta más respirar
De mi suerte no puedo lograr escapar
Tu silencio me explota el cerebro
Amarte así ya se ha vuelo un infierno

Viendo la lluvia caer,
Sola tomando café,
Veo pasar los recuerdos
de tantos momentos
que aún llevo en la piel.

Recuerdo verte llegar,
bajo una lluvia infernal.
Corría el mes de diciembre,
Recuerdo era viernes.
No lo he de olvidar,
La primera noche juntos.

¿Cómo olvidar lo que vivimos?
¿Cómo expresar lo que sentimos?
Tantos besos compartidos,
Tantos sueños que ahora se han ido.

¿Cómo olvidar?
¿Cómo me quito este dolor?
¿Cómo te saco de mi mente y mi presente?
¿Cómo olvidar que te llevaste mi corazón?

En mi reloj son las diez,
y afuera nada se ve.
Sólo la luz de los autos
que alumbran los charcos
y un poco mi fe.

Quisiera verte llegar,
Bajo una lluvia infernal
Aunque no sea diciembre,
Tampoco sea viernes quiero celebrar,

Me aferro a ese monton de nada 
Que una vez me hizo tan feliz 

Pero despierto en medio del dolor

El volver con leyes y argumentos
Que me otorguen razones para poder
Abrir la boca y la puerta de mi portal

Aquí esperando tan torpe y necio
Con cuatro copas y sólo quiero
Que pasé el tiempo

Ay, qué pena de mí
Aquí esperando tan torpe y necio
Con cuatro copas y sólo quiero
Que pasé el tiempo

Le busqué piedad a las mentiras
Invente disculpas de comedia
Para disfrazar las culpas de mí pena
Para hacer que mi burla fuera más sincera

Me quedé soltero a los cuarenta
Endeudé las pagas que me quedan
Y hay quien dice que no hay mal
Que por bien no venga
Y heme aquí, con mi mal y mis maletas

Te juró que esto nunca me pasó
Si quieres ponte mi chaqueta por que yo
Me muero de calor
Que no me cabe dentro el corazón
Que se me parte en dos

Que no se pierda en un recuerdo
Que se aparte de mi vida

Es más hermoso de lo que soñé
Y venga un beso o más

Pero a quien puedo pedirle este favor
Que se me quede aquí
Que yo también aquí pienso morir
Y un último favor
Ay dime si es que piensa lo que estoy pensando yo
Ay dios, ay dios

Que no se valla nunca por favor
Que no se acabe este momento no
Que no se pierda en un recuerdo

Dime si has sentido que se rompe el suelo
Que caes a un vacio sin final
Que cuando él estaba tú no lo cuidaste

Y ahora que no está lo valoras más
Y que al despertar yo miro en el espejo
Una historia que no volverá

Si un día tu lo encuentras dile fue mi culpa
Mi lección ya la aprendí
Por no cuidar su amor

Cuando una misma se lastima
Al menos he reconocido un grave error
Primer paso al perdón

Que cuando él estaba tú no lo cuidaste

Y ahora que no está, lo valoras más
Y que al despertar yo miro en el espejo
Una historia que no volverá

Si un día tu lo encuentras dile fue mi culpa
Mi lección ya la aprendí
Por no cuidar su amor

Ahora me toca a mí recuperarme
Caminar y sin juzgarme, sanarme

Dime que puedo yo hacer, dime que puedo yo hacer
Dime, dime, dime, dime amiga mía
Cuando se acaba la vida, dime, dime, dime

Amiga deséame serte
(Deséame suerte)

Olga Tañón,"En el mundo hay cosas tan maravillosas
Como ángeles que caen del cielo
A mí me pasó yo te contaré
A ver si te pasa a ti también

Yo curé sus alas el curó mi alma
Me hizo ver la vida diferente
Me enseñó lo nuevo, me enseño lo bello
Y toda mi vida fue cambiando dulcemente de color

Lo que no puedes perder es lo que se llama fe
Un ángel siempre te rondará
Mira tu alrededor y te sentirás mejor
A mí me pasó y te contaré

Pinto de colores y dulzura
Con su amor llenó mi corazón de ilusión
Me hizo tocar las estrellas
Me hizo ser una de ellas
Si hasta de la luna me miró

En la vida siempre existirá
Un ángel que a ti te cuidará
Llámalo primero luego mira al cielo
A ti todo se te cumplirá si tienes la fe

Pinto de colores y dulzura
Con su amor llenó mi corazón de ilusión
Me hizo tocar las estrellas
Me hizo ser una de ellas

A ti todo se te cumplirá si tienes la fe

Ángel de la guarda dulce compañía
No me dejes sola ni de noche ni de día
Ángel de la guarda dulce compañía
No me dejes sola ni de noches ni de día

Si tú te escondes te voy a encontrar

Con un brinquito con un brinquito
Mira pa arriba esta sentadito

Ya no es el mismo, su indiferencia 
La siento por las noches, rechaza mi presencia

Quizás la casa, la rutina

Y un beso que duro
Que cuando quise darme cuenta de pronto amaneció

Te juró que esto nunca me pasó
Si quieres ponte mi chaqueta por que yo
Me muero de calor
Que no me cabe dentro el corazón
Que se me parte en dos
Y el cuerpo no resiste tanto amor de un sopetón

Ay dios, ay dios
Que no se valla nunca por favor
Que no se acabe este momento que no
Que no se pierda en un recuerdo
Que se aparte de mi vida

Como el sol nos sorprendió sin avisar
Y yo que todavía no lo podía creer
Esto no puede ser
Es más hermoso de lo que soñé
Y venga un beso o más
Volvimos a la carga una vez más, una vez más

Ay dios perdona que te meta entre los dos
Pero a quien puedo pedirle este favor
Que se me quede aquí
Que yo también aquí pienso morir
Y un último favor
Ay dime si es que piensa lo que estoy pensando yo
Ay dios, ay dios

Que no se valla nunca por favor
Que no se acabe este momento no
Que no se pierda en un recuerdo
Que se aparte de mi vida

Keep the cake for the family and off Sarah Lee

Madness wildin out like special ed classes

Straight out the gate, meet Tony

You're just a lonely star
I try to bring you down but
A level isn't good enough
You always do as you believe so
I'm gonna fall asleep
And take a seat
And watch you fall apart
'Cause in the end
What are you without me?
I slow this down 'cause I know that you can't keep up
Oh baby I, maybe I was alone from the start
I might be proud, but at least I'm proud of something
You've taken pride in becoming nothing

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me

I'm married to the music
For better or for worse
You say that I'm privileged but
Your gift is my curse
I can't recall the last time
Someone asked me how I was
Well deject I was a fucking wreck
But my help can only shoot us
I sit in the dirt

You keep me on the edge of my seat

I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

Just forget what you've learned
Just forget what you've heard
The truth just confirmed
I can't bare the sight of you anymore.
You've become what I hate
Sold yourself for a bit of fame
Now that the wolves have closed the door
You wanna drag me down some more
Fuck you
Fuck you

Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls
Together as one
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit, are we free?

Are we all alone?

If you're gonna accuse me of pouring too much salt in the wound
We have just proved that they can pollute our heads with the news
They will manipulate the masses again

If you're gonna accuse me of telling you what you already knew
It's the same song sung with a different truth
And all of us forget it cause our head's inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again
Yeah yeah yeah we won't forget it

You better pray for absolution
You can change but you can't deny
A new wave in a terror nation
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Board it up, the borders are shut
The blood of the innocent is under the rug
White lies in a world corrupt
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight

Are we all alone?

Hope widows, shattered windows
Restriction without effect
Dead lines in silhouettes
Why do we ignore the warning signs
Cold calls to derelict homes
Needles at the side of the road
Wires and liars like thorns that won't let go
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Tell me where is your heart?

I think the silence speaks volumes
Now we march to our own drums
They're only singing what they want to be sung
Hate's become the new anthem
How could you?
When did our veins run numb?
We treat our species like a fucking flood
Hate's becoming our new anthem

Des Alleinseins bin mir selber wieder treu

Den ganzen Tag gelacht und rumprobiert
So denk ich an dich und an den Sommer mit dir

I'm in love with you girl 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true

You're soft, succulent so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two

To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try to understand

I'm in so love girl 
I'm just in love girl

And stimulate my senses when you are near

These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you

No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are

I'm taking my time, 
I couldn't live another lie 

This time 
My eyes will look at you 
Searching for better ground 
This time 
The rules we make will be mine

Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time with you
Open your mind, baby there's time for me and you",You're Not Alone,1996
Olive,"In a way its all a matter of time
I will not worry for you you'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind
You will surely see, a face that you recognize

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close now so many miles apart
I will not falter though, I'll hold on to your home
Safely back where you belong
And see how our love has grown

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely its plain to see
Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, baby there's timeto be with me
Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time 
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

Your not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time with you
Open your mind, baby there's time for me and you",You're Not Alone [Album Version],1997
Olive,"Your not alone...

Open your mind...

Surely its time to be with me...

In a way its all a matter of time,
I will not worry for you you'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind
You will surely see, a face that you recognise

[Chorus]
Your not alone
I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, surely its plain to see
Your not alone
I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely its time to be with me

It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close now so many miles apart
I will not falter though, I hold on to your hope
Safely back where you belong
And see how our love has grown

Olive,"I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love
I'm not in love",I'm Not in Love [DJ Dan Space Dub Mix],2000
