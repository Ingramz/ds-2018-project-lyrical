George Shearing,"Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard
Isn't it romantic?
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love

Isn't it romantic?
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss
Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romantic?
Isn't it romance?",Isn't It Romantic?,1959
George Shearing,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Heigh-ho, who cares?
Nobody writes his songs to me
No one belongs to me
That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times and disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times to go your own sweet way
Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon
As a moon
Just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Ride, Amazon, ride
Hunt your stags and bears
Take life in its stride
Heigh-ho, who cares?
Go hunting with pride
Track bears to their lairs
Ride, Amazon, ride
Heigh-ho, who cares?

Nobody's heart belongs to me
Heigh-ho, that's bad
Love's never sung her songs to me
I have never been had
I've had no trial in the game of man and maid
I'm like a violin that no one's ever played
Words about love are Greek to me
Nice girls won't speak to me
I despise the moon
As a moon
It's a prune
Nobody's heart belongs to me today",Nobody's Heart [*],1959
George Shearing,"Don't cry, there'll be another spring
I know our hearts will dance again
And sing again, so wait for me till then

Be glad the bird is on the wing
Another time to love
And laugh with me, just wait and see

I love you now
And I'll love you forever
Oh don't be sad
We'll surely be together

For the sky is bluer overhead
If you will just believe in me
There'll be another spring",There'll Be Another Spring,1959
George Shearing,"You came a long way from St. Louis, you climbed the ladder of success,
I've seen the town and country cars that were parked out in front of your fancy address.
You came a long way from St. Louis, you broke a lotta hearts between,
I've seen a gang of gloomy gals who were doing alright till you came on the scene.
You came here from the middle west, and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.
Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.
So natcherly I got my doubts, you got `em dropping by the wayside,
A feeling I ain't gonna know.
You came a long way from St. Louis, but baby, you still got a long way to go.


",You Came a Long Way from St. Louis,1959
George Shearing,"Don't ever leave me, now that you're here
Here is where you belong
Everything seems so right, when you're near
When you're away, it's all wrong

I'm so dependent when I need comfort
I always run to you
Don't ever leave me, 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to

I'm so dependent when I need comfort
I always run to you
Don't ever leave me, 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to",Don't Ever Leave Me,1959
George Shearing,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1960
George Shearing,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day,1960
George Shearing,"If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in Maytime
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you",If I Should Lose You,1960
George Shearing,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss

George Shearing,"I laughed at sweethearts
I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland
Was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That un-felt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Through all my school days
I hated boys
Those April Fool days
Brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato
Love I thought a sin
But since your kiss
I'm reading Missus Glyn",My Heart Stood Still,1960
George Shearing,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1960
George Shearing,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here!  Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here!  Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear,  why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here!  Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me

Stars appear,  why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear",Spring Is Here,1960
George Shearing,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

George Shearing,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low

Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low

George Shearing,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found a world completely new

Look what I've found me,
I've got myself a gentleman friend.

I'm referring to my gentleman friend.

His kind of kissin' 
Suits me to a tee,
What I was missin'

George Shearing,"I make a date for golf,
You can bet you life it rains.
I try to give a party,
And the guy upstairs complains.
I guess I'll go through life,
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains,
Everything happens to me.

I never miss a thing,
I've had measles and the mumps.
And every time I play my ace,
My partner always trumps.
I guess I'm just a fool,
Who never looks before he jumps,
Everything happens to me.

At first my heart tho't,
You could break this jinx for me.
That love would turn the trick,
To end my despair.
But now, I just can't fool,
This head that thinks for me.
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air.

I've telegraphed and called,
I sent air mail special, too,
You answer was goodbye,
And there was even postage due.
I fell in love just once,
And then it had to be with you,
Everything happens to me.",Everything Happens to Me [#],1962

Should have gone there long ago

Fly sweet song over the highest hill
Go to my loved one, Serenata for me
Sing him my song, love's melody

Tonight, when we are so far apart
Bring him back, back to my lonely heart

When you're in love, love finds a way

It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh

Nobody writes his songs to me
No one belongs to me
That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times and disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times to go your own sweet way
Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon
As a moon
Just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Ride, Amazon, ride
Hunt your stags and bears
Take life in its stride
Heigh-ho, who cares?
Go hunting with pride
Track bears to their lairs
Ride, Amazon, ride
Heigh-ho, who cares?

Nobody's heart belongs to me
Heigh-ho, that's bad
Love's never sung her songs to me
I have never been had
I've had no trial in the game of man and maid
I'm like a violin that no one's ever played
Words about love are Greek to me
Nice girls won't speak to me
I despise the moon
As a moon
It's a prune
Nobody's heart belongs to me today",Nobody's Heart,1971
George Shearing,"Fairy tales can come true; it can happen to you
If you're young at heart (young at heart)
For it's hard, you will find to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart (young at heart)

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart (young at heart)?
For as rich as you are; it's much better by far
To be young at heart (young at heart)

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part: you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart

George Shearing,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Just thrill me through and through,

I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me

George Shearing,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

A Beautiful Friendship Lyrics

This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
It ended a moment ago.
This is the end of a beautiful friendship, 
I know, 
'Cause your eyes told me so.

We've always been 
Like sister and brother, 
Until tonight, 
When we looked at each other.

That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love.

That was the end of a beautiful friendship, 
And just the beginning of love!",A Beautiful Friendship,1974
George Shearing,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too

George Shearing,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1974

Ah look at all the lonely people

In the church where a wedding has been

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

You can bet you life it rains.
I try to give a party,
And the guy upstairs complains.
I guess I'll go through life,
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains,
Everything happens to me.

I never miss a thing,
I've had measles and the mumps.
And every time I play my ace,
My partner always trumps.
I guess I'm just a fool,
Who never looks before he jumps,

You could break this jinx for me.

This head that thinks for me.
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air.

George Shearing,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning' sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

George Shearing,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1985
George Shearing,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart!
There's a line between love and fascination,
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they give the very same sensation.
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start.
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart,
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!",My Foolish Heart,1985
George Shearing,"Somewhere, someday
Well be close together, wait and see

To keep your winters warm

To keep your winters warm

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

Azure-te Lyrics

Gone and got the blues in paris,
Paris blues called azure-te.
How can I be blue in paris? 
Easy, ?cause you?re far away.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

Moments, springtime, eiffel tower,
Funny taxes, kids at play.
Paris without you is lonesome,
Yearning more and more each day.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

~interlude~

If you knew how much I need you,
You?d come back to me to stay.
Having you with me in paris
Really is the only way
To lose this blues,
This azure-te.

Can?t lose this blues,

With my heart in my hand

Than anyone else I know in town

To hound you and swear

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

But they are such a chosen few
And clover being green
Is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue

When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view, I should view
But moonbeams being gold
Are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue

When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, well

Darling I remember the way you used to wait, 
'Twas there that you whispered tenderly, 
That you loved me, you'd always be, 
My Lili of the lamplight, 
My own Lili Marlene.

Time would come for roll call, time for us to part, 
Darling I'd caress you and press you to my heart, 
And there 'neath that far off lantern light, 
I'd hold you tight, we'd kiss ""good-night,""

Orders came for sailing somewhere over there, 
All confined to barracks was more than I could bear; 
I knew you were waiting in the street, 
I heard your feet, but could not meet, 
My Lili of the lamplight, 
My own Lili Marlene.

Resting in a billet just behind the line, 
Even tho'we're parted your lips are close to mine; 
You wait where that lantern softly gleams, 
Your sweet face seems to haunt my dreams, 
My Lili of the lamplight, 
My own Lili Marlene.

When we are marching in the mud and cold, 
And when my pack seems more than I can hold, 
My love for you renews my might,

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

George Shearing,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,2005
George Shearing,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

Memories always start 'round midnight

When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.

Does it mean that our love is ending.

You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather

Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story

A moment of bliss we spent

But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

All begin and end with me

In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake

George Shearing Quintet,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust,1993

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Gone and got the blues in paris,
Paris blues called azure-te.
How can I be blue in paris? 
Easy, ?cause you?re far away.
Can?t lose this blues,

Funny taxes, kids at play.
Paris without you is lonesome,
Yearning more and more each day.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

If you knew how much I need you,
You?d come back to me to stay.

Unto the land of perfect day

Oh Beautiful Star the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains till the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray

Oh Beautiful Star the hope of rest
For the redeemed the good and blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine

And the night changed to day (and the night, the nights changed to day)

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1980

I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.

He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet

I found myself not feeling any pain
I told a 'Frisco girl I'd come for freedom
She said she'd only come to catch a train

Traded all the troubles on our minds
One thing led to another in the evening
And I fell in love again for my last time

Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime 
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time

Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell
I felt all the pains of a morning after
And all alone as far as I could tell 

Why she left I have no way of knowing
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime

But the fool in me came out one night
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes

And you find yourself inclined to look around.

And not an empty house where love just has been.
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,
Now love comes from the other side of town.

The life I'm livin' now just don't seem right somehow,
But it's the best way to get by that I've found.

She'd make her threats, but her heart wasn't set on goodbye

Right when I knew you were gone

Nervous wreck
I can't believe you said goodbye

Sit and smoke
Cry and joke
About these tears in my eyes

How could you do what you've gone and done to me
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

A million times
A million lines
And I've bought 'em, every one

You don't care
You rip and tear
Every dream I've counted on

I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive and you're the way you are

How could you do what you've gone and done to me

But what the hell
It wouldn't do a bit a good

There won't be no more next time doing me wrong
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone

How moody I can be, all my insecurities
You've seen me lose all my charm
You know I was raised on a farm
Oh, she tells her friends I'm perfect
And that I love her cat 
But you know me better than that

I miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer
Now it's ballet and symphony hall
I'm into culture, clean up to my ears
It's like wearing a shoe that's too small
Oh, I caught her with an issue of Brides magazine
Starin' at dresses and pickin' out rings

And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do,
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue.

George Strait,"I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waitin' for the worst

And he said

Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen

When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him

I said

Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen

Last night I dreamed I'd died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again

And they said","Love Without End, Amen",1993

Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote

And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand

I think this is how love goes

Though you show me everyday
Your love in every way
I'm afraid it's all a dream
That'll favor your way

Sometimes I need insurance of your love
For you soft and gentle touch
All the kings are worthy none
And at these times you take me by the hand
And like a child you lead me through
A wonderland of love

Wonderland of love",Wonderland Of Love [Album Version],1995
George Strait,"You swear you've had enough, you're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love, then out of the blue clear sky
Fallin' right into your hands, like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned out of the blue clear sky.

Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky.

Ain't love a funny thing, one day you're givin' up the dream
And the next you're pickin' out a ring out of the blue clear sky.

Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky.",Blue Clear Sky,1996
George Strait,"I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasin' crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darlin' when you come around

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on
Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away

It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol' stars same ol' moon up high
But when I see you standin' at your door
Nothin's ordinary anymore

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on
Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on
Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away

Carried away",Carried Away,1996
George Strait,"Once you told me you were gonna love me
That it was meant to be and there's no other way
Then came someone showed you more fun
We've had a good run better think it over

Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing

He's got a good line, shows you a good time
Did he change your mind guess it's your move
I'll lose my pride I'd even step aside
Honey you really must decide who's best for you

Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing
Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing

You might chose me or chose to lose me
Someday you'll see the good thing you had

Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing
Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing",Do the Right Thing,1996
George Strait,"I've traveled through lots of places
Seen lots of folks and lots of faces
Even settled down a time or two
I've worked the farms, I've been to town
Guess you could say I've been around
But I ain't never seen no one like you

I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way
But girl I think it's far to warn ya
I've done been to California
I ain't never seen no one like you

I knew a girl in Mississippi
Had twenty different ways to kiss me
Never found a thing she couldn't do
Hey I even knew some twins in Denver
Stayed with them one cold December
I ain't never seen no one like you

I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way
But girl I think it's far to warn ya
I've done been to California
I ain't never seen no one like you

East to west north to south
You're the very best girl there ain't no doubt
I'm tellin' you you're really somethin'
The way you got my heart a jumpin'
I ain't never seen no one like you

I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way

George Strait,"Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything
And she always expected the worst
In the back of her mind

He said, it's cold out here and I'm all alone
Didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon
And honey is there somethin' wrong

She said, don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

She said, don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this

George Strait,"You say you want to talk it over
Want to try again
But there's no way of workin' out
This love that we're not in

We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'
We've tried it all before
It's time somebody did some walkin'
And I can see the door

So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die

And I'd just as soon stop
I'd just as soon end the madness
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go

It's not an easy thing to do
Leavin' seldom ever is
But stayin' just to see us through
Just ain't no way to live

It's hard for you to understand
But we're better off this way
I can't fake it one more night
Or take it one more day

So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die

I'd just as soon go
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go",I'd Just as Soon Go,1996
George Strait,"I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,
And I bought her a home with a view.
I took her to the end of the rainbow,
But all I left her was blue.
Seems I never had time to love her,
And now it seems time just stands still.

I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.

Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.
I thought I was king of the mountain,

But I was only a fool on the hill.
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely

Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.

I love you, need I say more
Now and ever, we'll be together
Of that you can be sure
I love you, need I say more

I don't know just what it is
That you're needing to hear me say
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe
All this discussion could never
Do justice to something so heavenly-made
I'd rather tell you
With touches how I feel inside

Let me hold you, let me show you
What true love's all about
In these arms of mine I know you will find
You won't do without anymore
I'll love you forever need I say more

George Strait,"The first time I saw you
You were waitin' tables at the corner diner
I said to myself
Never seen a woman look any finer

From that moment on
I was stone cold gone
You would be forever in my mind

Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight

It was San Francisco
Silly suits and white ties by the bay
You appeared with your papa
Tears were rollin' down your mama's face

Everyone was happy
Showered by well wishers as we drove away

Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight

I'm living but dying
I'm laughing but crying
Somebody tell me it will be alright

I bought it for your birthday
God you looked so lovely in that dress
I took you to a party
Or was it to a night club I forget

Been twenty years and counting
I'm drowning in your love a little more each day

Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight

Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
