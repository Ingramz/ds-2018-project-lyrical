Xororó,"Tranquei a porta do meu peito
Depois joguei a chave fora
E bem depressa eu mandei
A solidão embora

E nem dei o primeiro passo
Já dei de cara com você
Me olhando com aquele jeito
Que só você tem
Quando quer me vencer

Dona das minhas vontades
Com a chave da paixão
Tranquilamente vai e volta
Entra e abre a porta
Do meu coração

Já sabe do meu ponto fraco
Das minhas manhãs e desejos
Desliza sobre a minha pele
Põe na minha boca
O mel dos seus beijos

Como é que eu posso
Me livrar das garras
Desse amor gostoso
O jeito é relaxar
E começar tudo de novo

Como é que eu posso não querer
Se na verdade
Eu quero bis rolar com você
Nem que seja pra brincar
De ser feliz

Como é que eu posso não querer
Se na verdade
Eu quero bis rolar com você
Nem que seja pra brincar
De ser feliz

Dona das minhas vontades
Com a chave da paixão
Tranquilamente vai e volta
Entra e abre a porta
Do meu coração

Já sabe do meu ponto fraco
Das minhas manhas e desejos
Desliza sobre a minha pele
Põe na minha boca
O mel dos seus beijos

Como é que eu posso
Me livrar das garras
Desse amor gostoso
O jeito é relaxar
E começar tudo de novo

Como é que eu posso não querer
Se na verdade
Eu quero bis rolar com você
Nem que seja pra brincar
De ser feliz

Como é que eu posso não querer
Se na verdade
Eu quero bis rolar com você
Nem que seja pra brincar
De ser feliz",Brincar de Ser Feliz,2005
Xororó,"Cada vez que me alembro
Do amigo Chico Mineiro
Das viage que nois fazia
Era ele meu companheiro

Sinto uma tristeza
Uma vontade de chorar
Alembrando daqueles tempos
Que não mais há de voltar

Apesar de eu ser patrão
Eu tinha no coração
O amigo Chico Mineiro
Caboclo bom decidido
Na viola era dolorido e era o peão dos boiadeiro

Hoje porém com tristeza
Recordando das proeza
Da nossa viage motin

Viajemo mais de dez anos
Vendendo boiada e comprando
Por esse rincão sem fim

Caboclo de nada temia
Mas porém, chegou um dia
Que Chico apartou-se de mim

Fizemos a última viagem
Foi lá pro sertão de Goiás
Fui eu e o Chico Mineiro
Também foi o capataz

Viajamos muitos dias
Pra chegar em Ouro Fino
Aonde nós passemo a noite
Numa festa do Divino

A festa tava tão boa
Mas antes não tivesse ido
O Chico foi baleado
Por um homem desconhecido

Larguei de comprar boiada
Mataram meu companheiro
Acabou-se o som da viola
Acabou-se o Chico Mineiro

Despois daquela tragédia
Fiquei mais aborrecido
Não sabia da nossa amizade
Porque nois dois era unido

Quando vi seu documento
Me cortou meu coração
Vim saber que o Chico Mineiro
Era meu legítimo irmão",Chico Mineiro,2006
Xororó,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",A  Minha Vida (Comme D Habitude) (My Way),2006
Xororó,"Ouço comentário pelos bares
Ironia nos olhares
Sei que falam de nós dois
O medo me desperta, é madrugada
Você dorme sossegada

Eu não durmo mais, depois
Fico imaginando, na cidade
Quem terá a felicidade
De me substituir
Sinto um calafrio se imagino
Outro alguém te possuindo
Minha vida a me trair

Será que eu sou
Capaz de ver e suportar sua partida
Será que eu sou
Tão forte assim
Pra não morrer na despedida
Só sei que vou
Dizer te amo, a cada dia que amanheça
E vão passar, dez vidas mais
Antes amor, que eu te esqueça

Quanta chance, eu tive de falar
Todo o dia te lembrar
Quanto, quanto eu te queria
Mais a gente nunca sabe bem
A joia rara que se tem
Se é real ou fantasia

O amor, amor, é um canteiro
Cuide bem o ano inteiro
É preciso dar valor
Quem não dedicar muito carinho
Corre o risco de um vizinho
Vir colher a melhor flor
Será que eu sou",Será Que Eu Sou,2006
Xororó,"Lá vou eu de novo
Buscar o que é meu
Não vou deixar perdido
O que Deus me deu

Eu nunca tive mole nesta vida
E nem reclamo do que já passou
Você tá pronto pra partida
Se é pra seguir, eu vou

Quanto mais poeira melhor
Conheço a estrada
O caminho eu já sei de cór
Desta vida marvada

Eu sigo forte com o jogo
Eu vou em frente
Sem olhar pra trás
Eu quero tudo e mais um pouco
Daquilo tudo que eu for capaz

E quando o bicho tá pulando
Eu já montei na cela
E quando a sorte fecha a porta
Eu vou pela janela

Quanto mais poeira melhor
Conheço a estrada
O caminho eu já sei de cór
Desta vida marvada

Na zoeira vou levantar mais poeira
Sendo guiado por Deus
Nesta estrada traiçoeira
Tô chegando eu não tô de bobeira
Mulherada solteira
E eu não tô de coleira
Tô fazendo o meu com muito suor
Colocando o rap nacional no outdoor
E o melhor é
o caminho eu sei de cór
É ou não é
Diz ai Chitãozinho e Xororó

É, e cada dia um desafio, é
Eu sei que nada cai do céu, é
Eu levo a vida por um fio
Eu moro embaixo do chapéu

Quanto mais poeira melhor
Conheço a estrada
Tô ai queimando asfalto
Se você tá comigo
Então joga a mão pro alto

O caminho eu já sei de cór
Desta vida marvada

Você abusa do álcool
Da cidade pro campo
Agora eu tô no palco

Quanto mais poeira melhor
Conheço a estrada
Tô ai queimando asfalto
Se você tá comigo
Então joga a mão pro alto

O caminho eu já sei de cór
Desta vida marvada

Você abusa do álcool

Xororó,"Deixe tudo como está
Faz de conta que não vai embora
De nós dois quem vai chorar
Ninguém vai poder dizer agora
Amanhã é outro dia
E quem tem essa mania de amar igual a mim
Por maior que seja a queda
No amor jamais se entrega quando chega ao fim

Não vou dizer
Que a tua ausência não vai machucar
Que não vou morrer um pouco ao te perder
Que esse teu adeus não vai me derrubar
Prefiro assim do que ter você aqui nos braços meus
Sonhando com alguém que não sou eu
Amando o que não sou
Querendo outro em meu lugar

Deixe tudo como está
Não precisa arrumar a casa
Vai sem pressa de voltar
Tem espaço pra soltar as suas asas
Novamente a nossa vida
Se não foi tão colorida como a gente imaginou
Foi tão linda no começo
Mas depois virou do avesso e tudo terminou",Vida Pelo Avesso,2006

That little homie let me talk my truth
Made an Instagram for my cat
And my cat doesn't even rap
And got more followers than you
Hold up, let me get my cat a bar
She's filthy, hey Cairo come here baby
Now my cat's more famous than you ever will be
I been hustling, you can't tell me nothing
I'm Brad Pitt's Ugly Cousin
When you're drunk at the wedding, still gon' fuck him

When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
You got me fucked up
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Like you don't know what's up
Bradley, he's cuzo
All my Angelinas if you got it let me see it

You're embarrassed huh?
I'm in Paris bruh
You brought your whole crew
I brought my parents bruh
Every white dude in America went to the barber shop
""Give me the Macklemore haircut""
Australia they heard of me
Germany they heard of me
Japan they heard of me
It's a murder scene you gon' learn some thangs
My dick name Ron Burgendy
I'm bad news with the pen flute
In a plad suit no can do
No no, I don't work for free
I used to smoke that purple weed
Sip a bunch of purple drink
That shit did not work for me
And now I just sip herbal tea
I'm posted at the swap meet in a row
Eatin' churches wings so cold
So cold no emergency

When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
You got me fucked up
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Like you don't know what's up
Brad, Brad, Pitt
All my Angelinas if you got it let me see it

Did it by myself, not a little bit of help
Nobody, nobody did nothing I know
On my knees saying God please give me a deal
And God texted me back
Don't be dumb young man, gotta do it yourself
It's up to you to turn the pen into a machete
And make sure that every beat that you meet gets killed
I treat the beat just like a pussy 
And I eat it up and beat it up, and leave it fucked
And you cannot compete with us
I'm weaving in and out of traffic in a Cadillac 
And wait is that us on the radio
Wait, is that us on the radio?
It's what I always dreamed of
Back when I had peach fuzz
Shout out to the homie D
Um, who's D
Deez nuts
I'm eating chicken wings and onion rings
If you're wondering, yes I does my thing
And another thing, no puppet strings
Oh the company, we sucker free
I ain't trippin' on what the public think
Ten thousand we hustling
This shit didn't happen over night
This shit didn't happen suddenly

When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love

XP,"I woke up, threw some sweat pants on
Then I fed my cat and I walked to the mini mart
And I really want a donut, shouldn't get a donut
Bought a donut, fuck it man it's really hard
Supposed to be on a diet, I wanna be like Ryan
He lost thirty pounds on that paleo
But fuck it man I love fried shit
I was gonna get skinny for the summer
I was gonna start doing my crunches
But looking down at my stomach
I'mma go to the beach, but I'm not taking my shirt off in public
My girl shaped like a bottle of Coke
Me? I'm shaped like a bottle of nope
I'd like to order a hot dog, some bon bons
A large soda, and some tacos to go

I never knew what a carbohydrate was
Turns out that it's all the snacks I love

I wanna be like Hugh Jackman, you know jacked man
With a really huge package
I wanna be the 2015 Batman
And send Ben Affleck packing
If you ain't gonna treat Jennifer Garner right
You don't deserve to have that
You better pass that to the homie Matt Damon
He eat the booty like Pac Man

You know I feel good about this place
You know I feel good about this steak
You know I feel good about this shake
You know I feel good about these plates
You know I feel good about this crepes
You know I feel good about this cake
You know I just love how it tastes
I'm not gonna wait, I'm not tripping about my weight, no

Happy New Years
Everybody got a resolution
But the next day, we forget about it never do 'em
I went to the gym and got a membership
Five minutes on the treadmill and I never lift
That was four years ago I should probably cancel this
But they tell me I gotta do it in person, ain't that a bitch?
But tomorrow though, I'mma get fit
Get me a fuel band and a fit-bit
Get me some workout shoes, and a bench press
Some lulu lemons and a french press
I'mma finally focus do some private yoga
Exercise my shoulders, I'mma hide the donuts
Realign my posture, no time for sofas
I'm finally sober no lime Coronas
But again, that's tomorrow
And today man I gotta go big cause it's my last day
Before I lose that weight, I gotta get one last plate and go big
I ate all night, Kool-Aid on ice
I woke up and I felt like shit
And I said, ""you know what, man fuck it
I should probably start on Monday instead""
Motherfucker let's eat

Xperience,"Moms and pops, they used to take us to Church
Saying, ""If you don't believe, then the plan don't work""
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement, I burst
Music brought me to my knees, I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit, I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues, I got problems, gotta make amends
I watch my daughter gigging in the kitchen to ""The Safety Dance""
This shit right here, we call love
You can't put that into words, but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms, I watch the fallen sun
Kiss my daughter and say, ""thank God"" as I wake up
Oh, I know, yeah, I know now
And I'm up, but I'm aware that it goes down
Travelled 'round the globe, I needed to slow down (that's right)
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown

Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday morning
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah

Oh my God, oh my God
No other person on this Earth could ever take my job
This my life, it was planned, I can't take it off
Bruised elbows, knees scraped, I learned to take a fall
My mistake, my mistake, karma waits, karma waits
But I'll be brave, I'll be brave
The pain stings more than I could take, I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain, than the gain
New state of mind, I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines, still pushing that '85
Like windows down, city passing by, like a timelapse
The weatherman be tripping, so that ceiling got that white rag, ay
We came so far, just some kids in the city trying to make some art
Leave some change in the fountain, hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role, never played my part

Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday morning
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah

I can have a life to, I have life today
I rely on that constant communication with my higher power
More so than anybody these days
And I realized, that that's kinda all I need
And then, of course, y'all appear, right
Y'all appear, things appear, and situations appear
And I realize, that's God working through me

XRepresentX,"To you it's just the same old story,
nothing in your mind has changed.
Your sustained affinity for suicide,
makes me question your sense of reality.
After all the textbook cases,
the tried and true stories of, not life, but death,
you continue to use yourself up,
with no intentions of stopping until theres nothing left.

Who has to die for you to change your path?
What do you have to lose for you to contemplate your life?
Take a look at it now, because death is so final,
and it doesnt leave much room for alterations.

but sometimes you dont seem worthy of the word alive. ",Live It Up,2006

But I never found the stuff.
But then I met this boy that said
He had the perfect place,
That I would just love, yeah.

Nothing about the place seemed dull.
And the stuff I was looking for,
I found the stuff.

The bass was booming,
There were people all over the dance floor.
Then I met another guy,
And he asked me would I like to dance,
He showed me steps I never seen before.
I walked in,

I hear the sound of rain

I can't help it if you put me in a daze boy

As I kiss you in the places

Brother does mo right. 
Under the candlelight. 
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that? 
I guess I can. 
Can I, why not? 
If I want to guess I can. Can I? 
More honey than a bumble-bee hive.
Pulling 69 ways in my archive. 
Sweet like licorice. 
Sugar for my booga. 
Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee. 
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check. 
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat. 
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I proceed to  Open up and feed you. 
I got a longing to put you where you want to be. 
Been I can, I get rid of all company.

Many have tried strict regulation. 
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation. 
Those that didn't perform well. 
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell. 
You're playing with my time. 
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me. 
You better work me. 
While you got the oppurtunity. 
To be in the midst of the L-why-T-E. 
Only the strong survive. 
Only the wise excel. 
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly. 
Left all alone try to control me. 
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets. 
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute. 
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot. 
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it.

It's natural. Never be ashamed.

So how do you love someone,
Who's a friend so dear?

Feeling so alone,
Calling you, please be at home.
Baby where you go,
I wish that I knew, but I don't.
And there are feelings of love,
That I feel inside for you.

But what if you don't feel the way I do.
And I know what love can do,

Xscape,"But you been sleepin' and you're creepin', babe,
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin', baby.

It's Friday night and I've been freakin' out,
900 times, I know I called your house,
So many times your momma cursed me out,
But I'm not sorry.

Saturday morning, I ain't slept at all,
I smelled her perfume and your alcohol,
They say that you and her have had a ball,
Don't you dare lie to me.

[Chorus: x2]
I know I'm gettin' the runaround,
I know that you sleep around,
So don't try and play it down,
I know you're givin' it, I know she's gettin' it.

I grabbed my keys and I jumped in my ride,
I may be hurt but I ain't gonna cry,
Just want to find out what you did last night,
Before I leave you.

I found her number and I know her name,
I gotta front this girl, make her explain,
I can't believe she dipped into my thing,
Yet she's getting over.

[Chorus]

It took a lot for me to give you all my loving, yeah,
And just to think I gave you everything for nothing.
I tried my best to satisfy you,
All the times that I stood right by you,
I think that I'll be better on my own, baby.

Oh baby,
I know your givin' it, I know she's gettin' it.

But you been sleepin' and you're creepin' babe
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin' baby

[Chorus: x2]

Now I can't believe that you did this to me,
Well, you better leave.
You go tell what's her name that it isn't a game,
Boy you messed up your thang.",The Runaround,1998
Xscape,"It's a glowing little feeling,
Like a summer sun that slowly rises,
On a new horizon of love.
And it's more exotic than Jamaica,

Or the rain that falls in Costa Rica,
Like a waterfall to the sea,
So tell me baby...

Do you want to fly, I can take you high,
Come ride on these midnight skies.
If you're looking for Heaven's only door,
You've got the key baby open me.

[Chorus]
Baby won't you come inside,
I'll take you on a fantasy ride.
Take a journey through my universe,
My love's the softest place on earth.
You don't have to pull the blinds,
Let the neighbours lose their minds.
Baby you can be the first,
Inside the softest place on earth.

Overflowing with emotion,
I can will you feel so sensual,
When I touch you, you will lose all control.
Come on baby, kiss me all over,
From my mountains to my valley low,
There's an ocean of love just for you,
Just for you.

Do you want to fly, I can take you high,
Come ride on these midnight skies.
If you're looking for Heaven's only door,
You've got the key baby open me.

[Chorus]

So no more dreaming,
Your body's steaming,
You want it baby, this is your night.
I keep arising, I'm fantasizing,

I want it so bad I'll do what you like.
We can do it in the movies,
Or in my jacuzzi,
Or maybe Central Park.

So if there's any doubt,
To what I'm all about,
So tell your friends I'm turning you out.

[Chorus]",Softest Place on Earth,1998
Xscape,"You're not in control when there's demands put on your heart.
You don't even know, cause when it's real you fall too hard.
And yet even so, you try to play like nothing's wrong,
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,
'Cause you can't run from your heart.

[Chorus]
Your eyes they tell me secrets that you, you can't deny.
Your eyes they show me feelings that you hold deep inside.
How do I know the secrets that you try to hide?
'Cause when I look in your eyes, the truth is alive,
I knew you'd be mine.

So now that it's on, it's time to face reality,
It's time to be strong, take all your insecurities, baby.
Don't be afraid, you gotta let your feelings flow,
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,
You gotta be true to your heart.

[Chorus]

Now that you're all turned out,
Don't you just love the way that it feels?
Now you can't do without my love,
And you know that's for real.

Now why you deny yourself,
I will never never never understand,
Because I love you and you love me too,
And that's just the way that it is yeah.

Xscape,"As I stand here contemplating,
On the right thing to decide.
Will I take the wrong direction,
All my life, where will I go,
What lies ahead of me?

I have strong determination,
And I'm not afraid of change.
I have yet to find that someone,
Who would care to satisfy me,
To stay right by me.

Who can I run to,
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?
Who can I run to,
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?

And my mind is so confusing,
Who would be that special one?
Everyday I'm trying to find you,
All along, I've got to know,
Is there a place for me?

I know love has many names,
And a message very clear.
All it takes is time and patience,
To bring you near,
But look at me, tell me

Who can I run to,
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?
Who can I run to,
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?",Who Can I Run To,2000
Xscape,"Suddenly it happened so fast
I couldn't believe the news that I received
My heart stopped as I hit the floor
I fell to my knees crying, ""Lord help me""

No matter what time brings
All the changes we go through
In life there's some things
We just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love you
For the rest of my life

Don't they know
True love never dies
I promise to love you
For the rest of my life

Life goes on, that's what they say
Time will heal all your pain away
But I feel, feel so alone and
Now you're gone, how can I live on?

No matter what time brings
All the changes we go through
In life there's some things
That we just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love you
For the rest of my life

Don't they know
True love never dies
I promise to love you
For the rest of my life

Until I see you again
I'll hold on to sweet memories
I'll treasure the times we spent
I see I'd do anything
I see your face, I see your smile
Calling out my name

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love you
For the rest of my life

Don't they know
True love never dies?
I promise to love you
For the rest of my life

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love you

Well it started off on the avenue
When I came up with the name called the So Def crew
It was me, my big homie Eddie
Up late making tapes, putting them out on the streets
I used to rap scratch even try to sing
Now I'm the little cat pumping out the steam
I used to play with it, now I stay with it, Lay with it
And huh keep pumping out hits
Cause can't nobody do it like we does
This side, that side I gets nothing but love
And I keep it pumping up in the club
Big with all the pimps, the hustlas, ladies and thugs
That respect that knock, when they hear that knock

But you can catch me at a money machine, Ching Ching

Kris Kross was the begining of the linen and cars
Houses, hidden clubs, shutting down the bars
I was only 19 doing big big things
In the CP living the American dream
Then I signed Xscape, first album 1.8 (million)
New company, my shit looked great
But uh, me being the player that I am I couldn't stop
I just had to find me something else to take to the top
Something fly that'll catch your eye
Thats when I bumped into my little sister from the West side of Chi
Demo after demo we made
Got so funkdafied now we paid
Rap or R&B we ain't playing
We demand y'all respect this afroman
As the game gets bigger, and my dough gets longer
And me and my crew get stronger
The more you wanna

(Verse 3)
In every flight there's turbulance and I had some
But I remained focused and kept dropping the bomb
'What should I do next?' that was going through my head
Then Candy introduced me to a Jagged Edge
Three homies from the Dec, one from right around the corner
We went in, came out, now everybody on 'em
Three albums later, everyboby on 'em
Ain't a city you can go where the girls don't want 'em
Once again I was thinking 'whats next for me?'
Then I got a big call from my homie Steve
He said Hey, let throw something your way
It was none other than my brother they comparing to MJ
Girls can't stop screaming, three mill now
Everybody love him and his name is Bow Wow
As the game gets bigger, and my dough gets longer
And me and my crew get stronger
The more you wanna

I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer that's when you had enough-a

Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can, if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need
A boost of energy to enter me and get it on?

You're gettin' warm, I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played

Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body, who's body? You're body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leavin' time to take home the loot

Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah

Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes

I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to goin' home at night
Brother does mo right, under the candlelight

Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can, can I, why not?
If I wanna guess I can, can I?
More honey than a bumble-bee hive

Pulling 69 ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga.
Juicy like Hi-C. or an Ice
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check

'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah

Many have tried strict regulation
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell

You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me
You better work me, while you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L Y T E

Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell, only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it

Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it

Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame
Get the name, and kick the game

To tha back steady stacking papers smokin' on fat
Stacks of danks see to some
I'm a hero of this feel on file
But that's my style
And they don't pay me nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real
For my peeps in that street cause to them
I'ma always be their baby

May we always be together
In the sands of time

Boy don't you know you can't escape
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

Xscape,"Every man wants a woman,
Where him and her can just go hang.
Just the two of them along, kick back,
Doing their own thing.
And every man wants a woman,
That can always keep him in the mood.
And I'm that kind of girl,
So this is what I tell my dude.

[Chorus x2]
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Every man wants a woman,
That can cook him up a good meal.
A woman he can treat like his homie,
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill.
Every man wants a woman,
That ain't good for just laying on her back.
And I'm that kind of woman,
So before me and my man get in the sack

From the barrel of Brooklyn
Three ladies call XSO, cafe,let's go

Hold up, freeze
I just wanna get between your knees
That's too much to ask I'm in the breeze
Roof top gone
Gucci top on got hot like pop corn shit

Kinda lucky you got me
Look, ma you'd be nothing without me
Them debit cards easily revoke
Plus I'm from the hood I'm easily provoked

You won't get fresh on my account, no
Your name comes off of my account, oh
And don't think I won't make that red dot give you pink eye
Get outta here, pop

Now, that we split up
You want me to give up
All that you gave
But what about my love in time?
Can it be replaced?
You never thought about me, babe
I see you haven't changed a bit
'Cause you're still acting childish

Guess, you've forgotten
I never was a silly chick, chick
And you can never get back this
So you can stop all the callin', complainin'
Stressin' or somthin', or not gettin'

No, you can't

How can you blame me?
You took my love and ran away
Expecting me to feel guilty
But what about my pain and tears?
Can't be replaced it's all been erased
Want what you want back I see you think I'm crazy

Guess, you've forgotten
I never was a silly chick, chick
And you can never get back this

Now, all I need in this life of sin
Is a down ass chick and you ain't it, uh
Thought you was real but you ain't shit, no
You can ride in the truck but you can't sit, ha
See you must got me micro-screwed

But if I spend, I'm a really spend
I'll put you on an island next to Gilligan, uh

Hey, where the piano at shawty?
Y'all ain't never seen a dope boy play the piano and rap at the same time
Have you?
I'ma show you somethin', dig this

[Verse 1]
I'm 22 and a vet in the game
Say I'm, supercoo', still a threat at the same
Time, rhyme bout the times I invested in 'caine
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to yo prayers if you prayin' for change
So, I dare you compare us and say we the same
When I'm, climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same
Mind frame, they accomplishments are nothin' to gain
Eventually, see I'm outta yo range
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
I entertain young niggas who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain
My shit bang, spit flames, put niggas to shame
Flow so insane, lyrics sick and derranged
Now you can't, mention my city unless you mention my name
T-I-P-I-M-P, I'm the man

[Chorus]
Hey be easy, you don't want no trouble with me
Just be easy, the drama ain't nothin' to me
Hey be easy, before you have problems just breathe
Hey be easy, you ain't worth dyin', believe me
Just be easy, you don't want yo mama to grieve
Be easy, well mind yo bizness, don't bother the G
Be easy, swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
Be easy, behind the scenes or behind yo greasy
Hey, be easy

See y'all kissin' ass when I came to leave
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what the fuck is fame to me?
I been plottin' since kindergarten, you's a lame to me
I give the niggas what they came to see
A reflection of one self where they aim to be
As you can see it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yourself
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro smoked that, now I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga

Dear God don't know if you noticed but
Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book
And us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look
And all the people that you made in your image
Still believing that junk is true
Well I know it ain't, and so do you
Dear God
I can't believe in
I don't believe

I won't believe in heaven or hell
No saints, no sinners, no devil as well
No pearly gates, no thorny crown
You're always letting us humans down
The wars you bring, the babes you drown
Those lost at sea and never found
And it's the same the whole world 'round
The hurt I see helps to compound
The Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Is just somebody's unholy hoax
And if you're up there you'll perceive
That my heart's here upon my sleeve
If there's one thing I don't believe in

It's you

Oozing like napalm from the speakers and grill
Of your radio
Into the mouths of babes
And across the backs of its willing slaves

Funk pop a roll consumes you whole
Gulping in your opium so copiously from a disco
Everything you eat is waste
But swallowing is easy when it has no taste

They can fix you rabbits up
With your musical feed
They can fix you rabbits up
Big money selling you stuff that you do not need

Funk pop a roll for fish in shoals
Music by the yard for the children they keep
Like poseable dolls
The young to them are mistakes
Who only want bread but they're force-fed cake

Funk pop a roll the only goal
The music business is a hammer to keep
You pegs in your holes
But please don't listen to me
I've already been poisoned by this industry!

I need to know was it her lips, was it her smile
Or even the sexy ways that she looked at me
Ohh, so sweet I wish I that could have her next to me

If you see this girl, yeah
Beautiful smile, lovely style, wonderful
Kind, just about what I want
Ohh, way just changed my world
More than that, just be the last
Just the one that I want for me

Would you tell her
If you see her walking by, the way I feel
Would you tell her
If you see her at the mall, the way I feel

Would you tell her
If you see her looking lonely, the way I feel
Would you tell her
Even though you don't know her, the way I feel

I hope that I see her again
But this time I won't think twice I will say, hi
And also ask what's her name and how she's been
Ever since the sunny Friday afternoon

If I ever get the chance to talk to her
Let her know what's really going on
But the possibility seems so hard
There is almost nothing I can do but any ways

Would you tell her
If you see her walking by, the way I feel
Would you tell her
If you see her at the mall, the way I feel

Would you tell her
If you see her looking lonely, the way I feel
Would you tell her
Even though you don't know her, the way I feel

Can this be love at first sight?
Someone tell me why?

Would you tell her if you see her walking by

Would you tell her if you see her at the mall

Tercero, yo por ti no siento más amor
Y por eso me voy.

No me digas que no que ya no, jamás
Sé que fallé, pero no quiero que te vayas
No me digas que no que sin ti no soy nada

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Si pudiera yo volar
Estaría ahora contigo

Porque te amo demasiado
Es que te quiero a mi lado
Y solo tú tienes
La magia que me hace enloquecer

Quisiera ser en quien tú pienses noche y día
Quisiera ser la luz que alumbra tu mirada
Quisiera ser el aire cuando tú respiras
Cuando estés riendo yo seré esa alegría

Quisiera ser, en quien tú pienses noche y día
Quisiera ser, la luz que alumbra tu mirada
Quisiera ser, el aire cuando tú respiras
Cuando estés riendo yo es

Esta mañana a las nueve suena el reloj
Como amanecida y sin energía ella despertó
Rápidamente se prepara toma su café
Hay un examen en media hora tiene que correr

Ella es tranquila un poco timada nada fuera
De lo normal no es lo que piensan sus amigos
Equivocados están, porque cuando cayó la noche
Sabe lo que tiene que hacer, leda vergüenza
No lo piensa hay niños que mantener
Si hoy tiene suerte ganara más que ayer

Sus seguidores pagan buen dinero
Siguen sus pasos y el resto de su cuerpo
Su último error
Su último error
Ooh, ooh

Ella es la Reyna de la pista cuando escucha su canción
Satisface a otro cliente sliding down that hobb
Solo un poquito de plata garantiza diversión
Pero solo un poco más you can probably take at home
Que es tranquila un poco tímida nada fuera de lo normal

No es lo que piensan sus amigos que equivocados que están
Puede que sea la más querida de la universidad
Siempre demuestra un buen ejemplo si supieran la verdad
Todo fue a cambiar al caer la noche

Siguen sus pasos y el resto de su cuerpo

Xtreme,"Te recuerdas la noche en que me diste el primer beso
Even though que tu corazón tenia dueño
Como un tonto a tus labios me entregue

Te recuerdas, cuando te cantaba en el teléfono
And you always used to tell me te quiero
Pero nunca pensé que te iba a perder

Por mi madre te lo juro que te amaba
Mi propia vida, mi amor te lo donaba
Por qué te llevaste mis besos
Sabiendo que era sincero
Cómo te pudiste ir

Por mi madre te lo juro que te amaba
A cual donaste el amor que te entregaba
Por qué te llevaste mis besos
Sabiendo que era sincero
Cómo te pudiste ir

Do you remember the day that you told me that you love me
I was lonely, I believed it and now it's hard to me
Now I can't believe that love went away

Te recuerdas, cuando dejaste de buscarme
Y me di cuenta que ya era muy tarde
Que ese niña a otro hombre regreso

Que não fede nem cheira
Que é um monte de nada

Adoro quando namoro

Por que se não eu choro
Me dá que eu nunca mais choro

Xuxa,"O segredo dessa vida é alegria
Que uma simples gargalhada pode dar
Rir é o melhor remédio
Pra acabar com o tédio
Quem não vai gostar

A tristeza vai ficar lá fora
E você levanta o seu astral
Dando uma gargalhada
Que não custa nada 
É sensacional

Não tá com nada quem só sabe resmungar
Vive feliz quem faz sorrir a criançada
Com bom humor o mundo pode até mudar

Viva o bom-humor

And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
It's suicide or it's do or die
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I'll give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry), I fuckin' love you
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you (don't cry)

The whole club was filled with the indo smoke
E-Swift was scratchin', Tash was hoe catchin'
I had the latest fashion but my shit wasn't matchin'
So King Tee was baggin', the nigga Threat was braggin'
Bout his brand new, baby boo, fiendin' with the rag in

Here's a dollar ten rum and coke, heavy on the alcohol

Yo shortay, you're lookin' kinda nice
Stick around and watch us rock the mic device

It was this fly ass freak, I didn't sleep, I got the digits, laid back

I think I'll call her, we're talkin' on thephone for half an hour
I finally ask her can a nigga come through
She talkin' bout she ain't dressed I said ""Cool, I'm still comin' over""
I get there, she's chillin' in some undies and a robe
Ice cold, forty down in the freezer
And roll up blunts at my leisure, I play like I believe her
How she tellin' me she ain't no skeezer
An hour later I was breakin' her off
In each and every position that you can ever put a bitch in
I got up and then I washed my shit
Alright bitch, word got her rings then I split

The club reminded me of whylin' at the Bush back in the day
That's when I seen her, the freak from the diner
Her name was Nina, or Tina, or was it Regina
Fuck it, the bitch with the tipple bitties and the boomin bass
I said my name is big game all in her face
I said for what it's worth, I'm the best on earth
Kickin folls off my turf since the day of my birth
I got a pocket full of money do you wanna help me spend it
Can I get in your backfield like Cornelius Bennet

Just let me know the time and I'll be there""

I left my money in the truck so won't you pick up the check""
And the next move, you might think it's tasteless
But I gave her a tip and got ghost with the waitress

We rip shows, and hoes drop clothes backstage it's funny
The shit bitches do for money
Only jockin on a nigga with his name in lights
I'd rather kickback relax and play the shades real tight
Yo last time, caught it with this fresh-ass hooker
Kept runnin' her mouth about what it last meant to her
I said, ""Look hon, all I gots is blunts, forties
A couple of brothers cause I don't know the kids before me
You're trippin."" Dip into the streets to chill
Nigga these days, I'm gettin PJ's, on the freeways
It's lovely, I get home, blaze up another drink
Of somethin' kinda stronger, to make the funk last longer
Yo, it's the one and only who welp the bitches
Thinkin' they got me but yo they gettin' they-self
I'm a bomb like the stealth, and hit way up above your wealth
You felt the vibe when I tapped that ass

When it comes to shit like this 
I always get it right the first time

But that's the breaks the highs and lows 
Of the industry

Bringin' it live 
Get it crackin' to the third degree

Is the place to be, Catashtrophy... 

Tash: 
The Alkaholiks is back to fry you 
Xtra crispy 
With the skills that make the plots 
to dis me Xtra risky 
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate 
And stop my forward motion 
California will have broken off 
And fell into the ocean 
Cause i rocked around the world 
With my ill type skill 
Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal 
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks 
Is gettin blended 
Certifed bartender 
So catch the 40 
When I send it your way 

Xzibit: 
Niggas that hustle 
Till the day light break 
Go to county 20 times 
Still can't go straight 
Don't nothin in the mothafuckin'

I'll never see a nine to five 
Cause it just ain't me 
(It's like this) 
Xzibit shall hustle, lift build muscle 
And think like Russell 
Survive and bring it live and direct 
To any crowd through out the world 
Like this come home 
And smoke a spliff in the benz

So what nigga is it you want to do

My flow is metaphorical 
Historicly correct 
What do you expect from a nigga 
With my intellect 
East coast representing West coast gangsta 
New I ain't trippin' 
I call up King Tee we go dippin' 
Through the streets 
Pumpin' hard core Likwit beats 
Flowin' air blowin' loungin' 
Inn them leather seats 
Think gback how we used to rock the house party 
Now we just fuckin' it up for everybody

How dare you try to compare 
Yourself to the original 
Professional Xzibit break you down

From beneath the Earth's surface 
Where I write rhymes so fresh 
I try to bite my own verses 
Cause the purpose of my flow 
Is to let you know

Xzibit,"Intro: Xzibit, [J-Ro] 

I really wish I could you know at twenty-one 
youknowhatI'msayin',he he, yo yo 
[I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things 
I do, youknowhatI'm sayin'] 
Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin' 
Go ahead 
Yeah! I break it down like this 

Verse One: 

You see I don't like to remenisce about the past 
The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth 
Each and every wrong move the police keep count 
make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out 
I was at the funeral when it all began 
You know the painful transition from a boy to men 
I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine 
didn't understand death nearly lost my mind 
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it 
Age ten, new step family arrangement 
at thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick 
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit 
I would forever be hit with anything in reach 
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach 
about forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked 
Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked 
physical contact was in form of a slap 
at the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back 
courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap 
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black 
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate 
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate 
I don't remember the date of the judicial debate 
but legally I was now in custody of the state 

Chorus: 

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink 
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak 
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make 
Gotta find some way to release this hate 

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink 
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak 
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make 
Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight 

Interlude: Xzibit, [J-Ro] 

[Yeah it's fucked up though man] 
[YouknowhatI'msayin'] 
Yo 
[The fuck you doin' in jail] 
Insane man, I don't know man, he he he 
[Yeah wats goin' on down there, gotta get out dude] 
Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man 
YouknowI'msayin' 
[It's popin' man] 
It's cool yo fuck that 
[It's popin' out here] 
They can go on and on for that 
[I'm tellin' you it's popin' man come home] 

Verse Two: 

And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home 
but only now I was fucked up plus all alone 
My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone 
Turned age sixteen now on my own 
Started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too 
with no hesitation lock load then blast you 
Without a hastle we in a town of hicks 
fuckin' all these chicks 
Sellin' rock by the bricks 
so we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown 
At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down 
Screamin' demands ""Let me see your goddamn hands (now)"" 
A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban 
we never kept it in the house 
So of course we clounded 
Only found one pistol took us all down town 
We be out by the end of the afternoon 
gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM! 
Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife 
Ty and Matt caught bodies 
Now they spend there life behind bars 
catchin' scars that will not heal 
niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real 

Chorus 1 1/2 

outro: 

Like this 
Like this, like that 
Yeah! gotta carry the weight 
Like this euh! 
Bringin live 
Yeah! yeah! like this 
It's Xzibit 
Gotta carry the weight 
Like that yo!

Xzibit,"Rule Number One 
Always be aware of your surroundings 
And peep all exits 
Stay and move to the next shit 
Rule Number Two 
Love no one that don't love you 
And if the shit come down 
Then you know your way around 
Rule Number Three 
Realize it ain't about size 
Or havin' gats and guns 
Because it only takes one 
Handle your business 
Don't let your business handle you 
It's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do 
What you're doin' right here, right now 
Same color, same style 
Tryin' to claim worldwide 
And ain't traveled but one mile 
In these shoes, I paid dues 
With nothin' to lose 
Live by the rhyme 
But I'ma die by the booze 
Xzibit breakin' down niggas 
Who got somethin' to prove 
Here we are face to face 
Nigga make your move 
You're in the wrong place 
But at the right situation 
Cause I was waitin 
Hotter than Satan, never perpetratin 

[Chorus:] 

I treat my enemies like friends 
So I can reach out and touch 
Leave'em in the dust at the very end 
You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin 
Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins 
Animosity you can reach out and touch 
Heavy right handed 
Teeth grind like a clutch 
And plus you ain't never had this much 
Too many friends too close 
You might collapse from an overdose 

I was raised to never follow after no man 
To be my own man 
So I can die by my own hand 
And never knowin' what the next day can bring 
So I gotta make the ends 
Justify the means 
Yo, I'm on the scene, here to do my own thing 
Can't never spend a lifetime 
Chasin' after dreams 
I got the right shit 
For all the wrong reasons 
As long as I breathin' 
Niggas change like seasons 
Never trust a man 
Who can't look you in your eyes 
Only the strong survive 
And that's word to the wise 
Yo, when dead bodies get outlined in chalk 
Everybody should walk 
Cause real killers don't talk 
I ain't really concerned 
How many bridges you burned 
I extinguish your flame 
And take aim at your brain 
Givin' ligament pain 
To have you walkin' with a cane 
Wantin' money and fame 
You got your fuckin' self to blame 
And that's West Coast rhyme 
Without no gimmicks 
Here come Xzibit to break it down 
Like a chemic 
I'm spreadin' like an epidemic 
And all good things come to an end 
Enemies & Friends 

[Chorus ]

I don't give a fuck 
About the set you claim 
Xzibit easily dispersed like crack cocaine 
See I lent my shotgun to Kurt Cobain 
And the motherfucker never brought it back 
Ahh, that's wack 
As a matter of fact 
This one nigga tried to jack 
My squad had his ass 
On the run like track 
Never knowin' who to trust 
In this shit called rap 
Here to let you know 
My sound surrounds like dat 
Never half step 
Or play the role like DeNiro 
Y'all niggas wasn't down 
When we had less than zero 
Fuck tryin' to be a hero 
Tryin' to save some bitch 
Mr. X to the Z 
Never play that shit 

[Chorus ]

Yes, 1996, yes 
Bringin' it live from the Westside 
This is X to the Z

These niggas ain't ready

Since a juvenile callin' 
Shots in the dorm 
Moms said you better get right 
Or shake the spot 
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone 
Like pop 
Stashin' the rocks by the gats

So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze! 
I don't fight the feelin' 
Gotta hustle with a passion 
Comin' cross state to put you down 
With some action 
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets 
Remininsin' younger days 
Over gangsa ass beats 
And I, 
Hit the weed 
Til myeye balls bleed 
While my life is corrupted 
By lust and greed 
Serve you anything from cocaine 
Up to speed 
I came with the drank 
So here's five on the weed

See kids don't belong 
Up in grown folks business

You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget
Hit back when hit
Use force that's effective
All these bitches and women
Son, please be selective
This is California can't stick your dick in everything
We will survive necessarily by any means
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you
It's the 90's the police just arrest you,
disrespect you on occasion take life
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked
Ready to rock
Then shake the spot
The Foundation

You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers
Who forever smoke bud
So it's probably in your blood
Realize you can only run the streets so long
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong
Same shit different day
It's the same ol' song
If the time ever comes that I meet my match
Take control of my assets
Fuck startin' from scratch
Take care of your mother
Keep yourself on track
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back
Beware of the serpent
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike
And try to make you loose sight
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill
Son if you ever pull heat
Then use it
If you got a chance to walk away
Then do it
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations
A solid foundation

You are the foundation
Beginning of a new generation
I remember hospital hallway pacin'
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine
Only to find that yours looked like mine
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time
In this life you can't press stop
Then press rewind
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man
Have your own plan, expand your mind
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs
This is nothing but love
Via satellite Mug gs
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife
Be prepared for the worst
But expect the best
No matter where life takes you
Come home to the West
Survival takes more than just gats and guns
That's words to live by

Bad seeds is planted to grow large and toke us
Whatever is left will be eaten alive by the locusts
Hear me not, believe me later
You can feel the animosity through this Irwin Vega
A full clip to make this bullshit stop
I'm in the struggle to bring
The underground to the top head lock, Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous
And beautiful bitches
Smell the aroma nothin' but doja, the Likwit soldier
Quick to fold you in half, sit back and laugh at you
Xzibit standing firm ground like a stone statue
You ever have a forty five slug blown at you?
We unstoppable, so everything is possible

Xzibit maintain focus till the casket drop
That's (focus) the only to survive and stay on top
Fast five days straight to meditate, build hunger

Fast five days straight to meditate, build hunger
And focus (focus) on the days and times that approach us

Be on the lookout 'cause this year
Some niggas gettin' took out
Takin' off of the scene man versus machine
I live between a rock and a hard place
About face stand straight this is General X
Dedicated to the critics
That hope and pray that some day I'll go soft
And try to swing with a gimmick and fall off
Runnin' with dogs you can't call off
Isolate to eliminate that's the mind state
Never violate, I make your whole chest dilate
Defeat my appetite to annhilate
I carry the weight from state to state
Spread the product
Tired of friends and relatives gettin' shot up
It's time for some action like Redman and B-Real
'Cause I can be a dead man if I stand still
Too close for comfort, I'm under the gun
Like a felon going back, I'm ready to crack
Making niggas role they credits and fade to black
Fade to black fade to black fade to black

Yeah, everyday of my life
Got clear thinking, and everything stay tight
Drop bomb shit, only bomb shit
Here come Xzibit to break it down like this

Xzibit,"So it's one fifteen in the mornin'
I'm comin' up, a hard day, serve
We gettin' drunk smokin herb and the third dike you roll
Non-stop cash flow
Twenty thousand dollars and the rest cuttin' Yayo
We had the rocks, my nigga late to pick it up
Get him on the phone, hurry up 'cause I ain't tryin to get stuck
So what the fuck is the hold up?
(""Nigga sit your ass in a chair and I'll be right there"")
Reminds me I gotta shake the spot
I got bitches in the hotel room ready for me to bang cop wait
Yo, who is that man?
(""He wanna spend a couple of hundred, (yeah), but he'll be right back"")
That's when I shoulda got the heater
But I was too busy in the kitchen countin' money
And takin' shots of Tequila
Started countin out twelve when it hit me with gallons of seman
If you was Rocksteady, you woulda came when the C-Note's rang
Before I could yell out to lock the front
Niggas rushed in the front door with the gauge, ready, duck
Bad enough I'm caught up in it, jacked
I'm caught in the kitchen without the strap
(""Where's the muh-fuckin sack homeboy?"")
Woulda killed Terminators only D between us
Is a stove and a refrigerator
Came in and put the gauge to my chest
Took the money off the table
And said (""Yo, where's the rest of it nigga?"")
You gotta love it, came straight to the moneyman
Twenty thousand cash, neatly stacked, wrapped in rubber bands
Snatched the whole shit and broke out
I ran to the living room and got the heat from under the couch
Smashed out to the middle of the street started blastin'
Dumpin' at the getaway car but they was mashin'
I thought I heard the homies just in time for the action
Police hit the corner with they reds and white's flashin
These niggas rolled off with at least a cool fifty
Ya, I'm in handcuffs on the ground and mad 'cause the K-9 bit me
Shipped me off downtown for the bookin'
Threw my herb sack when the cops wasn't lookin'
Fingerprints, hold the tape, hear come detectors
One at the door, another one askin' questions
Stupid shit like  ""Who was I shootin' at?""
Was it gang related and where do they kick it at?
But I didn't say shit I can tell from all the people involved
It was an inside job
But I'm the wrong nigga to rob, I'll hunt you down
Fuck the money, I'll take you off and accept the loss
Set bail at fifteen g's, no sweat
Got cars slippin tonight, and almost got wet
Homies come to set bail see, but that's all right
Since I'm already here I'mma spend the night",Inside Job,1998

It's like movin' all this weight
Got Xzibit up tight, right
Partner came through with two white boys (Dude)
Talkin' noise bout a hot spot
Where bitches come alone and niggas don't cock block
Let the top drop
And we out, hit the liquor store
Give me O.E. And three blunts no, make it four
Anything else? (Vitamin C pills and orange juice)
What are you drinking, Gin? (Nah dude, it's the shroomz)
The shroomz?
Yeah, that's some other shit
One of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mothership
How high it make you get? Fucked up? Throwing up guts?
Or do it have you stuck with soft dick and can't fuck? Hold up

Now chew 'em up and slam the orange juice
Vitamin C chase, kill the taste
You can tell it's nasty by the look on my face
Don't get it twisted like a nigga coked up
And druggied down, see Cannabis and mushrooms
Be coming from the ground, all natural
Post it at the club, looking funny-style
Tight slack, pimp feather hat, where the bitches at?
Yeah we giving orders at the bar holding money
When all of a sudden all the people started looking funny
And started lookin' runny and liquify
Right before my very eye
This a different kind of high

(Oh shit, you see this shit
These motherfuckers is melting and shit)

Niggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize
Feeling hypnotized
Pupils dialated, changing size
That's when I heard the battle cries from across the room
Set these crooked niggas straight
Likwit Crew, activate
Form of, a bunch of wild niggas mashing you
Came crashing through
Elbows and right hooks for you
We got thrown out by this time my shit is blown out
Pull the phone out acceleration and we bone out
In the zone out beyond Captain Kurk and Klingon
Shit that I'm on be high powered like a Yukon
Back to my house, fucked up, tryna see straight
How much of that bullshit did I actually take? (Two grams dude)
God damn, no wonder why I feel like a underneath
Told the white boy ""Faggot, we got beef.""
Over did it holmes
Niggas playin' bones in the living room
Restless, tryna find anything to mess with
Where my keys at?
Pickin' up clothes, trying to fold the shit
See my riot gage on the wall, better unload the shit
Fucked up niggas and firearms don't mix right
Cocked back the chamber, dumping shells 'til it felt light
Thought I dumped them all, counted to seven
But it was eight, straight
I'm gone point the barrel at the floor, let it go",Shroomz,1998

Smoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin

Get to clownin y'all punk bitches, cause I'm a Mac, like Ronald
I make Mac make money, and mack murder wack rappers

Fatality before you ever reach your senses
Got so-called writers, crashing into brick fences

Xzibit,"The official representative, LAC
This is prophecy manifested by X to the Z
Victory, strike a B-Boy stance in khaki pants
Never get along like red and black ants, advance
When you're staring at this concrete that move like liquid
Like a nigga without legs, I ain't trying to kick it
Too much to finish, a menace, without enough time
My mind only give punchline, you probably thinking of the wrong kind
Cause if it jokes, nigga know
The kind that drop on your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your throat
I promote self-defense. not dollars and sense
Kick it with scholars and pimps, you just the last part over the fence
Assed out in the open, while you was hoping that Xzibit was second rate
But I refuse to make just another record in the crate
I think not, got bee-bops
I bring it to your house like Pink Dot

Stand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean
When I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines
Hit and decapitate the bird case, featherweight
Critical thinking, while you add water to concentrate
Xzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box 'em in
Seal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen
Xzibit run with a regiment of veterans
I only like to come out late night, like Dave Letterman
Time for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick
Calling me a hater cause I don't ride dicks
Read my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips
Love the sound of clips when I load my shit
Chamber Music, this is for the ones with stone-face
That catch you at the right time in the wrong place
We unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice
Take away your life like three strikes

Yeah, come on, Chamber Music

So now Xzibit got a little money, I think it's funny
How motherfuckers think I'm supposed to share like Sonny
Clarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat
You don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique
Accomplish more in one day than you can do in a week
The X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean
End of all things manifested in flesh
Fuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class
Catch a roadrash, all you smell is hash
Chronic mix, bumping the Liks addicting like a Heron fix
Bear-arm from here to a hundred-twenty meters
Get black-balled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald
The assassin, brother who came blastin'
Take it without askin', rappers is all fashion
Xzibit keep mashing through
Got any last words? I got two
Try ""fuck"" and ""you"", like that",Chamber Music,1998
Xzibit,"Yeah

So it all comes down to this (what?)
Specialist with a hit list
Right fist bomb type M.G.M. Fight night type (ding ding)
So when I hits in the stage we can Face Off
Watch me rattle your Nicholas Cage
Bring heat in ridiculous ways
Never compromise look into my eyes
Tell me what you see (what?)
Victory ecstasy maybe Hennessy
Energy wasted, enemies gettin' laced with
That point blank to the face shit
Who you think this is
Young black bust a nigga ass strickly business man
Self disciple Heineken let the record spin
Paparazzi all over again
Times ten like thee original sin

No gain with no pain (it gets deeper then that)
Dyin' in the fast lane (way deeper then that)
To the place where the motherfuckin' problem is at

Long hair ganja smoke but don't be mistaken
I ain't Jamaican, find another chicken to jerk
A world of hurt nine to five puttin' in work
Never rest put to the test get put to the death
Never the less only greater than trust no man
Soon to have the whole wide world inside of my hand
So I suggest you act right my insight like sunlight
Burn your cornea big bad California
To the Waldorf-Astoria, N.Y.C.
Competition wish to some day roll like me
But all I see is capital H-E-A-T
I'm makin' motherfuckers Run like DMC

Heir to the thrown, Xzibit bring the lead to your dome
Like a 3rd world rebellion squad on your boulevard
Protect they spots with heat they kids gotta eat
To make it big in Cali it depends on who you meet
And who you sleep with might find yourself in deep shit
So hit me with your best shot, I'm lookin' forward to it
You shouldn't repeat it if you ain't really goin' through it
How dare you try to check the fluid rip the track
Chillin' on your big plans like Wilsure and Farefax

Black folks wanna sweat you harder than the one-time
Never participate in dumb, def and blind shit
Plus I got my little man, so daily I'm reminded
The ride only gets rougher (right)
But I'll be damned if me and my niggas suffer
Smuggle this motherucker with the raw shit, I'm blessed with
Lookin' at the world, burned for the young and the desperate

Assassin lyricist, serious, muscle in this
I call the bets, I know we got coordinates on more games to wreck
We blaze shows, never no Half Step
Tactics, B-Boys, no games no antics
No false images, no bullshit semantics
We planned this, for hundred of thousands
Rainin' on they brains with lyrics, from the mountains
Don't contemplate what you can't even demostrate
Defari lottery draftpick, never the second rate
Nigga who wanna hate but front like its all great
I gots no time for these emotional niggas, I gots to motivate
Moves to make, best rhyme straight

I'm scoutin' the, best land for property
Never sloppily, picture someone stoppin' me
From gettin' mine, line after line
And you wonder why I call these fake niggas Miller
They think they genuine
I'm startin' to shine, imported Italian
With a custom made Herut charm as my medallion

Seem like, I recite the same prayer every night
Watch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight
And fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight
Till then, lick it to the chin, let it begin
We could break bread or break skin and watch me send it
Try not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it
And my directions, suggest for your own protection

Cross me or cause me, fuck jiggy and flossy 
I'm tryin to keep the government off me 
Dodgin hard time and house arrest 

Whatta you expect, findin' what ya never forget 
'Cause you're sellin wolf tickets that your ass can't pay 
What I display, skill last found in Cassius Clay 
In this prime time, hustle for mine 

Used to nickel and dime 
Doin felony crime, but now I bust mine 
Instead of bustin' at enemies when the sun go down 
Me and my niggas with a fat one 

Smoke 'em all down to nothing 
Crushin rappers, bare Witness like Jehovah 
Swore we haven't been sober 
Since 21 and over 

[Chorus]
 
King Tee do your thing 

When the Likwit hits my soul 
I get conceptions to make the microphones explode 
The drunk mode, sippin X-O from the straw 
King Tee broadcaster raw 

Optical intoxication, flood your video station 
Scramblin any playahation 
But some of these fools got tricks in they boxes 
So I blocks it, pull they whole set out the socket 

Tha Alkaholiks rock shit 
Any which way man I got shit 
The Alkaholik don, king from Babylon 
With some fatal shock shit 

In this district, I'm listed as the mystic majestic, I gets hectic 
What you expect, shit 
The Likwit comity 
Believe me loc, things will get shitty 

Ain't goin' look pretty 
Commin' from the likwidation squad 
Smoke weed, drink hard, my god 

[Chorus]

We O-W in the whole zone 
Likwit Crew is on the microphone 
Let it rain brother [Repeat: x 2] 
Let it rain 
J-Ro do your thing 

Fuck that East-West mess 
I'm gettin' rest last 
We make the crowd say ""yes, yes"" 
Faster than the SS 

Impala, you got beef than holla 
My crew sticks together like Richy and Dollar 
We got the boom-boom claats, shakey like Don Knots 
They bitin like a room full of pits and rots 

I got that old school soul 
Called take it back like repo 
And I got foes on my shelf like homes T-Paul 
I'm see-Bo, that's my homeboy Rico 

Posted up with three French bras at the need bowl 
I got dressed wit the speed of a cheetah, finished up my two liter 
Hopped in my 2-seater 
Sunshine, drivin' down fine 

Walk a 1 on 3.9 
They playin oehh so fine 
Got 'em on the fifth floor 
Knocked at the door 
Xzibit's in the house and he brought three more 

""What the fuck is goin' on in here, What's happenin', 
Where we drinkin' at, These my homegirls right here, 
What y'all drinkin' right now, fuck that, All we got 
is Hennessy"" 
 
We O-W in the whole zone 
Likwit Crew is on the microphone 
Let it rain brother (2x) 
Let it rain 
Rico do your thing 

And up next, we got the Likwitest 
It's so drunk, it's ridiculous 
When Tash got the mic, 
I swing my shit like Jack Nicklaus 

I'm spinnin' this with niggas that slept on Likwidation 
'Cause no matter where you go, 
They know the reputation 
CaTashtrofy I punk lyrics with spunk 

I'm like the renegade of funk 
That get that 'bumstick' krunk 
So if you watch your ship sunkin 
Fuck you with the drunken 

Than come a little closer 
Let me head you somethin 
I bomb with a wig blowin up your click 
Now take your pick, you can kiss my ass or suck my dick 
Cause this is how we comin' in 1998 
The Alkaholiks, X, and King Tee the great 

""It's the Likwit Crew, King Tee, Mister X to the Z, Ah,ah, 
Alkaholiks, Likwit motherfucker came to tore the house down""

I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yo we gettin' restless me and dawgs
Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message
Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump
I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump
Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage
It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC
Bombin' first 'cause I feel it's better to give then receive
You better believe, Xzibit stays savage above the average
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cup of tea
But all that's irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate
I dance with the devil for the hell of it
Burning down your lavish landscape on digital tape
'Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?

Niggas are null and void I get swole like a Keloid
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure
So open up your door to me
'Cause if it's closed I'm a breakin' in with some pantyhose
Over the mic so you don't know who I sound like
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight
It's not permitted by the right
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan
Till I threw you in the back of a van
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet
For those with plans to clone me
The original it can't be done I'm digital (digital)

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yo who wanna come see the hard rock?
The non stop grid block yo whole block receive speed knot
You need not, get brave my bullets never graze
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone
So better get off on your own bitch
Rollin' chrome shit tryin' to own shit, I was moulded
After the best that the streets had to offer
The author of my own destiny so I suggest you stop stressin' me
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape
'Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?

I'm so hungry for the mic like we just gettin off the ground
But my style is at a national
Three albums in, you ask your friends about catash
They'll say ""tash can injure ninja""
The gunner, I walkin in ask about the spread
Bet against the likwit crew's the best way to lose your wig
'cause I'm above y'all niggaz heads, below y'all niggaz knees
My style'll get you drunk till you can't say your ""abc's""
I get my write on, nick at night wit my light on
'cause goin plat-I-num is what my homies got they sight on
'cause I been mega-tight on microphones since I was tethen
I may not look like I'm the deepest, but looks is deceivin
'cause I be takin mines into deep space nine
Wit a sip of brew for me and two sips for mankind
'cause tash got the style wit more soul than solid quartz

Yeah, L.A. niggas

Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Xzibit,"What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube, was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was banging with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'mma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first drew with
Claiming that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catching bitches while bitches be catching feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down! Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About 5 bank accounts, 3 ounces and 2 vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

Aight, hold up hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got something to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me
(The fuck!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right?) just know this shit

Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed whose throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like ""The Chronic"" was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show!

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, M-C's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin' M-C's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9nes's vild""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway and Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of Jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown

Qu new york, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' judge joe brown they just actin'

Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my hennessey straight

Going down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backing down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk driving, trying to stack my loot
While other rappers getting ""Treated Like a Prostitute""
So check the SoundScan

All I wanna be was a G, ha!
My whole life, nigga please, ha!
Breaking off these motherfuckin keys, ha!
Let's get these motherfuckin G's, ha!
Nigga you don't wanna fuck with this

Oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezee bay-bay
You jocking my style? ""You so cra-zy""
Dre say, ain't ""No Limit"" to this
As long as we drop gangsta shit
Look here bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it ""Doggystyle""
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental
Lincoln Continental
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

I get this pussy everywhere that I go
Ask the bitches in your hood cause they know

Bitch please! Get down on your god damn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed
Look, you fuckin with some real O.G's

Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dough (f'real)
Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks
Oh, you like setting niggas up and getting them loc's?
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (well hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg I'm movin!
Ain't nothing to it but to get to groovin
You've been waiting on a nigga like me
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (bang BANG!)
I'm trying to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho

Yeah

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the x man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some olde english that's covered with frost
And it's like that

[ chorus ]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

{frost}
I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the h-k with the laser
Slid the enterpriser, rent a 99 black blazer
I shot straight at merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the peppermint casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

[ chorus ]

{jayo felony}
I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? that shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual
Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the general
Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal
Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal
I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & bentleys
I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and dentyne
See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth
Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside

You got me fucked up I'm innocent

But you believin' that bitch
You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'
'cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go
Where my lawyer, nigga told me juv' I can't do nothin' for ya
Y'all go tell that to my mother & my father
But they gon' cus y'all so don't you even bother
You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'

Look the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball
This is my third felony plus my third strike
Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to life.

Qu new york, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' judge joe brown they just actin'
Indy's throwin' tyson back in another year
Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my hennessey straight
'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts
And turn killers into girl scouts works of art

Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short
Still the thought of murderer true to the sport
I bang with the best niggas them career criminals
Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out
Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now
Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial
New kicks new trial I don't give a fuck
I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts
Ready to self destruct lord I don't want to die
But what powered your honor to hit me with 25
I know that real recognize every hustle
And die with these niggas in the struggle
Ya feel me

Oh god shells loaded in the semi auto quoted
Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene
Huntin' for greens like mike meyers trick or treatin' on halloween
Mashed down in the fatigues servin' the fiends
Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve
In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess
Ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets
No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts
Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug
You 'bout to die thug!

Who are you, what you do, who you tryin to threat?

The police gon' have some dead bodies to haul out
All out in the open for the world to see

Cause you can't ball accurately, tackle the beast
Stomp it down, slap it with heat, bitch behave
Shit, we blaze to make a nigga act his age
I'm tryin to write the phrase that pays
You kick it with gays, dykes, and all type of wackness
Preach what you practice
Here we separate the real niggaz from the actors
A&r's, mc searchin, suck my cactus!
Blackness surround your sight and sound
As xzibit hit you and you hit the ground
My chips ain't never gon' be down, watch me smoke
And flatline the first nigga to cross this line

To yo' block, or they streets, we all gon' hang
We like to shine and ride, bump corners in our bumper cars
Top down, with the candy paint job
Import export up and down the highway
Old ladies transportin straight through the skyways
In the corner in the five(? ) I got purple haze
Fat knot short sess with the tree ton(? )
These streets we run, rapper refund
You ridin up but we want yo' flows old like girbauds
We hold, everything it takes to create the odes
To north to the west to the south again
If it's war that you want just pull the pin
Rules we don't break 'em, we refuse to bend
If you don't build right you better take yo' ass home
Cause some catch stray bullets all alone

I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquid by the gallons

[Tash]
Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who want to get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference
For instance, ""21 and Over"" set your clocks back
(Tick tock tick tock) Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless
(Thirty niggaz, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin' guestlist

I'm takin caller number one, that is..
Rrrah uhh, bitch - you took too long

Full rack up in the back {*BZZ BZZ*} shit is tight
Full charge and I'm out for somethin
Mass production, Battlecat bang percussion
End of discussion, hittin some corners, rearrange thangs
and brang change, we expand California
Listen - I lost more than I can ever gain back
from this road to riches, makin my heart turn black
So I'm cold to bitches, and I never call back
Plus I'm stoned and vicious, lay your whole hood flat
Get your, shit together nigga Big Snoop Dogg told me
'Do music and leave that other shit alone homey'
We came from dust, the X-odus, the hard to touch
y'all niggaz ain't fuckin with us, and plus
it ain't nothin like standin on your own two
So run them streets, but never let 'em run you

Time is steady wastin, steady wastin
Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait
Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin
I'll bust 'til I'm deceased, yeah, wooo-oooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh

Tune in, witness the rise of a icon
The python wrap around 'til your breath gone
The upper echelon, and I'm the cat you pull a weapon on
and want to squeeze 'til my life is gone?
Back to the wall and trust nobody
Sippin Cognac with Kurupt, Young Gotti
Somebody gotta recognize this
Throw fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist
Number one draft pick, lead the league in assists
Give a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists
You just settin yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this
Only a few slide through like the Schindler's List
Who's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse
the niggaz that bring in the coke or smoke the crack?
Metaphor figure four let it break your back (yeah)
It's been a long time, where the gangstas at?

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Damn it feels good to be back in the saddle
On top of the game, crackin the frame, the heat of the battle
Been a long time comin but we waited
Xzibit went from bein hated, to makin the whole world say it
Give a fuck if the radio play it
Niggaz fall like the domino effect and you can't delay it
It ain't about who you are when you're makin your stack
It's the look that's on your face when you givin it back
So picture that

This hollow point lead gon' be your last meal
Say your prayers, say your graces
Pieces of your face is found in a hundred different places
Huh, so what we lookin like?  We tryin to see some hoes to fuck tonight
and you just tryin to see the afterlife
Make a decision before we have a head-on collision
makin me spend the rest of my life in prison

How does WHAT feel?  Not havin to scrape for a meal?
Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?
The biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille
We had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints
Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent
then sent the rest to my people to invest wit it
Custom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it
and I suggest you bring a million niggaz runnin wit it
Split it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look
I ain't gon' stop til everybody's shot
Muammar Khadaf's the dot, X mark the spot
with an infrared to your head, left for dead
Fuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon)
I suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance
it takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker

Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line
Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time
Restless, rugged, never relaxed
Permanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax
Baseball bats and breaks upside of your head

And y'all bitches just somethin to do, don't get it twisted
You're easy like Sunday mornin and shopliftin

I'd rather bam to your face with a bat

Bitch niggaz continue to floss and lip-sync
And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope
Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat
Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction
Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin

Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid

Mr. Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Running your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Ravel your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lacking
whenever you hear them other niggaz rapping
Rocking chains, stadium, palladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop top tinted on twenties
Using rappers like crash test dummies
Stacking real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

What an event, we hardcore a 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
It be like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat
Restless no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grier
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Come back, bounce in the spot and slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessey, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now scream

X to the motherfucking Z
Mr. Exuberant, Extravagant, Extraordinary, Exciting, X-a-lotta
X-O with a little bit of Ecstasy
Xing your bitch-ass out if you trying to test the G

Right here

Yeahhh.. wha**up Slim?

What''s crackin?

Hit this s***

Ssshhit I almost hit this motherf***er today

Psh, is that right?

What is it with motherf***ers thinkin that..
Because we''re in the spotlight or whatever that..
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won''t retaliate

Protect my motherf***in self, by ANY

MEANS, NECESSARY

Right?

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

Make no mistake, I''m the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate

Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home

But my baby momma hate my guts and can''t stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can''t watch my seed grow up?

F*** THAT, this the f***in thanks I get
For tryin to edutain a**holes and feed my b****
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
'Cause you seein more support than I''m seein my child

It''s like..

... everyday I wake up, another drama
It''s a wonder I''m alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her

Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up theavenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won''t let us put up afence

And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it''s unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you''re so full of s***
This clip is so full it''ll spit if I don''t pull it

And don''t give me no bulls*** I''m not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the s***
Don''t tell me bout the show business s***
I know what this is, b****

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

This ain''t business, this is personal B****
You don''t know Xzibit from s***, new school, cla** dismissed
I had a very F***ED UP day, I''m needin this fit
Shuttin motherf***ers up like they pleadin the 5th

Yo Em it''s time to get serious with it (yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in theskillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain''t no neighborhood that''s big enough to bang on us

Ain''t no love lost my n****z, relax yo''self
I''m about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my n****z who never seen it I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones

Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a f***in piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I''m ridin a camel
Millionaire motherf***ers with their brains in their flannels

I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele'' n**** soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind b****es gettin dick to spit shine

Sniff lines of coke, that''s the only s*** that make you dope
B****-a** n**** that''s droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherf***ers tell me the right s***

So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?

F*** that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
Tryin to walk up and knock like these c***suckers are not

Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it''s a disgrace Hailey can''t play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
Screamin some s***, leanin out your windows, beepin n s***

Or pullin up in my drive like I won''t leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them

That if someone comes to my crib, I''ma shove a gun in theirribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
""Oh, now he''s pullin guns on his fans
Just for tryin to stand on his porch""

And I''m the bad guy, cause I don''t answer my door like ""Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!""
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
And climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you

It''s not that I don''t like you..
.. it''s just that I''m not behind the mic
I''m a person who''s just like you",Don't Approach Me,2000

Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

One, two, three, four
Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
One, two, three, four
Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God
Rah Digga, First Lady of the Flipmode Squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggaz you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime
I'm an Alkaholik nigga so I finish the fifth
You at the front door bitchin because you ain't on the list

It's like
One, two, three, four",Down for the Count,2000
Xzibit,"I wanna speak to you motherfuckers for a minute
Yea thanks for the lighter
Anybody smoke here?
Aight, that's more for me you punk
Motherfuckers
Look, check it out, look

[verse 1]
Everybody, he was born to hustle
It's a very thin line between the boss
And the muscle
We foot soldiers
Face first in the trenches
Only time I'm on my back is fucking these
Hoes and weight bitches
Hell's kitchen, raw kitchen
Never crying and bitching and settling
For less
Metal in your chest, take a final breath
Revolutionary
It's x-man the mercenary
Carry a .44 desert eagle
Feeding the people even if it ain't legal
Low-riding in the regal or the cadillac
Money stacked probably give yo ass a
Heart attack
Purchased your last cd I want my money
Back
You see the battle ima see you in the
Street
Survival of the first to draw the heaters
And the cannons
I'm guaranteed to be the last man standing

[chorus 2x]
Crack a bottle for your hard time
It's dedicated to my soldiers on the
Front line
This one's for all of us
Thinking bout your casualties
Learn from mistakes, protect your family
Cause it's the year 2000

[verse 2]
Everybody wannabe king
Fuck everything
All this shit is bout to me mine
I hear it all the time
Live your life for the day
Easier to burn than papier-mache
Started with dre
Graduate to radioplay
I still ain't satisfied
Bout to blast off worldwide
Get in line check the politics
Ever wonder why only certain
Motherfuckers get rich
Ain't this a bitch
Barely can eat, barely can pee
I dedicate my life to the street
It's not for you if your stomach is weak
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets
That's the only time I really find peace
Having violent stand-offs with the police
North hollywood beef
Grinding my teeth
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief
New breed I'm the bad seed
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes
Bleed
Dedicated to the niggas that despise us
So ain't nobody s'posed to be here
Besides us
Catch a flatline

[chorus 2x]

[verse 3]
I was one that never begged for nothing
Me and my homies build penitentiary
Huff-it
Running your mouth like a bitch cause you
All on my dick
What is he dogg pound now? is he still
With tha liks?
Is he rich? is xzibit a crip? this is
Business stay the fuck out of my family shit
A grown man, the back of my hand is what
You will see
If the x-fives make you believe
You check the sound scan I do the math
Me and my staff run a worldwide warpath
A bloodbath, make xzibit have a good laugh
It's going down, hit the ground like a
Plane crash
You lil fags ain't prepared for the x-man
Scared and desperate
Young and restless
There is no guest list
Move to the back of the line
Yo it's my time, prime time only where the
Beats and the rhyme shine

[Scarface}
I got trouble rhymes to a death the troubled times
A double nine incase niggas get out of line
And heaven knows that I tried to change
But in the mist of trying to be a better man
Trouble is all I can seem to see
And the fact I know tomorrow isn`t promised to me
So from this day forth I`ll be all I can be
My brother turned his back on me
Got to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes is I`ma play my own hand
And I`m tired of being let down by my so-called friends
Regardless to the blood shed ? no tears in the end
Father please forgive for I have sinned ? forgive us all
But I ain`t to blame ? the lunatics wearing my heart
And I think I gotta build another wall
Cause I don`t want the world to see me
Cause maybe these demons will try to end me
I`m exhausted and my body`s sleepy
Never the less it`s hard to rest ? I`m a nervous wreck
I walk with the stress
I use to walk around with a vest
But now a days I be like ""fuck it dog
You fuck with me I gots to fuck with ya`ll""
And ""make ends"" is just another word for ""pay back""
Paying you back today for this grudge that I had way back
You niggas I grew up with wouldn`t play with that
I send you bitches to the morgue with holes in your head
No remorse ? why you think my niggas taught me to ball?
Cause I be walking around in designer suits?
In fact these niggas know that I`m the truth
Always scandalous ? eye before I shoot
For disrespect there is no excuse
Calling the choices

Using my colors against me but this time stay true

Fuck around with this shit and get your wig split

Shout to my homies out west hoo-bangers!
Mack Deezy for Sheezy
All my niggas in the Bronx
Holdin' them corners down
Ya heard? Get it right!

Joe cracks back, been a long time comin'
No mean to disrespect but a lot of y'alls frontin'
Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas
Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas
We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name
Throwin' blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin' to get stocked
Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block

It's like the rap games far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lane, how come? They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin' to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin' VSOP tearin' my liver
Livin' my life like I don't care I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin' I'ma make it home

The streets is funny peeps'll kill you
Over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin'
And don't keep it gully, I'm from the Bronx
Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin' that you comprehend this

Its the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
Its the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on strangers

Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up like ""Yo, why me?""

I never really had a pops
But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the streets my name
And heat's my game, 'cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the cast, you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap at you though

You for real here, niggas be followin' with steps
I made my own moves, so the tokers, could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you once considered a friend

Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin' to scare society
But can't slip again 'cause my lil' man relyin' me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin' to climb hills
And tryin' to make me kill for less

Yo its the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo its the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up
Like yo, why me?

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work

I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chaser
It ain't safe here, the bright lights cablide you
Mix sedica, swallow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin' these streets

I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin' they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin' to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin' for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin' from nothin'
Comin' from nothin', makes you struggle harder for somethin'
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin'

The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, don't make me have to spray ya

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'

X finish em off quick, makin' your jaw split
When I'm touching the mosh pit

Nauseous raisin' the stakes

Increasin' the weight
Got homies that can lay down and lift the plate
So, quit tryin' to invade my space
Before I call for a face-to-face
And got to rest my case like

This is how we do it
Just recognize we keep gettin' right to it

Then you might despise the size of my game

Infect the world leavin' Vicks in a old sweater

Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin'?
Who gots your undivided attention?
Who makes your panties wet, girl?

Hold up, pause, which nigga on TV
That you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion

All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin'

Mindin' my own while haters throw soft

Menage-a-trois for moi, let's figure this out
I drink your Hennesey fifth, let's work the shit out
She don't gotta cheat 'cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees, side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin' a fuck, we fuck all night
Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit
And blow your mind
Get in line bitches, stay on the grind
Cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs
Ain't surprised you can be so pretty
And be so nasty

Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
With friends like y'all, the fuck needs enemies?
I beat, I stab, I kill my enemies
Refuse to let you waste my energy

[xzibit]
I heard they callin me a immigrant; well this motherfuckin immigrant
Came to yo' city and started runnin shit
X is like the government, taxin that ass
Been harassed to the point that I'm ready to blast
And spend the rest of my life behind metal and glass
Never seen a nigga move so fast, cut you in half
Sick of all these threats, these bitches with no action
Hog-tie, watch you die and start laughin
And no longer will I sit back and let you disrespect the fact
That we elevated west coast rap
And bring shit back to the point ""x"" is all that they checkin for
In the clubs, the streets, the shows and the record stores
What more can you ask for, eat your heart out
Fall out with bitch niggaz constantly callin my name out
I'm really not givin a fuck, you're pressin your luck
I'm a walkin warhead ready to self-destruct, so what? !

[chorus]

[xzibit]
My name feel like a slap in the face
My name feel like a gat in yo' waist
My name is all over the place
Erasin all misconceptions
I live my whole life with aggression bitch;
And I'm not stressin
Your words ain't workin I feel so much pressure
Padlock, chain around, neck no lesser
Sick of niggaz runnin they mouth
It don't take much to get knocked out, round these parts when I start
Shit full clips get emptied, revenge we
Move like the secret service, I ain't nervous
I just wanna tell the truth.. the whole truth
When I'm on the stand explainin how I had to shoot
Absolute domination, extreme mutilation
No hesitation, I'm a movin violation
So don't get hit in the street
Used to have friends and family, now I got nothin but beef
What the fuck? !? !

[chorus]

[xzibit]
So-and-so hate me, blah-blah gon' get me
If I gotta go, y'all niggaz comin wit me
I'ma walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Cinderblock stock, shootin straight from the shoulder
Just too much shit in the air
Burn bridges you could never repair
I slap box with a bear
I can speak from experience, you speak from ignorance
I remove you, have your whole family feelin it
Y'all hate the fact that x-man got hustle
""man vs machine,"" mind vs. muscle
I drop concoctions, you leave me no options
Have your bitch screamin out, ""somebody stop him!!""
No more mr. nice guy, I'm a tyrant
L.a.'s finest, open bar behind us
Don't look hard, it ain't too hard to find us
From here to infinity, fuck my enemies!

to lead me, but it wasn't easy to see me
Get up off the block to the TV
And sell a couple million CD's, best believe me
You see these callouses on my soul?
Couldn't let hate and paralysis, take control
I pick you up when you down 'til I can't no mo'
My name sting in your mouth like canker sores
Been at war my whole life, sleepless nights
Endless fights, but still can't walk to the light

Whatever your persuasion, this is the message
Time is of essence especially when you're countin your blessings
Lessons learned from the deepest of pain, it's not a game
Keep my name outta your mouth and I'ma keep it the same, ya dig?

Only to find out crack and rap was the same thang, damn!!

Ain't afraid of no hard work and sacrifice

Makin sure he see a side of life, I was never able to see
Hittin home like ""Ground Zero,"" move over now
Peace to the real heroes, still underground
I put it down for the homies that came that's hard in the paint
I'm livin proof it's never to late, you straight

Able to do for my loved one's, real success 
Your the source of my strength I was blessed with your gifts
Your insights, your wisdom, your penmanship
Fun n games, I'm doing thangs, I know you wouldn't agree with
What I drink, what I smoke, who I be with

Opened up my heart showed the world where I'm coming from

I lose touch and sometimes I feel that life sucks

We ponds in the game biological warfare

I could have been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could of snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, stready trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about, c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I shit across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly

X, pass me the weed
I'mma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man
Watch your fucking mouth

I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho say my name

For the last time man, I'm through",My Name Is,2002
Xzibit,"Yeah, today the big day
(Xzibit)
Been here four years, eleven months and twenty-nine hot ones
One more day and I'm a free man walkin
Leavin from behind these gates, I paid my debt to the state
And ever since they took the weights
Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin
Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend
Remember like it's yesterday, eight-teen and ?
I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them
Goin for a ride that I cannot stop
Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots
And for those that don't know, that's the Pen-East to Fresno
Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck ""Let's Make a Deal""
Livin around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will
At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that
Niggaz givin up the manhood they can't get back
It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum
Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles
More than that I'm missin my kids
Missin my turf, missin my bitch, what could be worse?
Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit)
Some nigga picked up, wanted to break her neck
When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back
Cause when you pick em up and read em that's where you're at
And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back
Level four right away, gettin hit the same day
Playin the price for the games you play
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened
Tacs gettin taced up, plottin and talkin
Sellin everything from weed to blow
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know
niggaz holdin weight, essays got the power
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours
? tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak
And then physically and mentally cannot compete
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin
Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz that's freshed out
But some of these niggaz on swipe
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again
On all times take the long walk to the front gate
Dress out expandin shit, today my release date

[X] Alright my niggaz, I'm gone, see you in an ounce dog, woo!

[G] Hey get in the car, my nigga, sup X?
Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga
Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker
[X] Ha, yeah right
Check it out dog, everybody know that you just got out
That shit was all on the radio
But dig it I got two strippin bitches

Ya had it, ya lost it
Ya leased it, ya flossed it
Business fell through now ya comin up off it
He bought it, he rolled it
He passed it, you smoked it
Now ya fucked up off some weed mixed wit coke shit
Ya love her, ya hate her
Ya fucked her, ya raped her
Twenty-five to life 'cause ya can't control ya anger

Its solid, its weak

Be careful what ya wish for
Ya fuck around and get it
I did it got in it
Spit it and didn't waste a minute
So where my niggas at?
What part of the game is that?
I paid my dues now nobody tryin to pay me back
And if they did i would probably have as much as shaq
My life is the movie so listen to the soundtrack
This what its all about
You better stall me out
And feel the aim of the name you niggas callin out

[Chorus]
If you feelin how I'm feelin
And you ready and willin
to come to the table
I put it together who doin it better
Come bounce with me (Come on)
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)
Take em out!
If you movin how I'm movin
And you chosen and proven
So lose the illusion
The top guns cue the confusion
Come bounce with me (Come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)
Take em out!

I'm tired, I'm hungry
You're lazy, disgusting
You're lay around my house and ya never do nothing
I seen it, believed it
Planned it, conceived it
Missed me with the bullshit bitch I don't need it
I cheated, you cheated
We cheated, so beat it
Eat it like a dick bitch you too conceited
I broke it, replaced it
I slammed it, I chased it
Hands in the air if ya love gettin wasted baby!
You never seen us before
You betta come and get it
You with it I'm with it
I'm busy baby you fuckin with it
Is it your place or mind
don't want to waste your time
And you can get it how you want it it'll blow ya mind
Its over time
Takin pride in the bump and grind
A hit from behind to leave you with a broken spine
This what its all about
You better stall me out
Its just the game of the name you bitches callin out

[Chorus]
Pop it, drink it
Float it, sink it
Plan to stop me then you better rethink it
Drive it, use it
Pimp it, abuse it
Shit motherfuckers do to hip-hop music
I live it, I die it
I'm laughin, I'm cryin
Pop two of these bitch, lets start flying
I hear it, I taste it
I touched it, I faced it
Breakin down the bullshit back to the basics
I had to kick in the door
that's how I had to get it
I shitted with lyrics
And getting better for fuckin credit
Gettin gangsta with it
The best that ever did it
Hit it and quit it my nigga
You shouldn't babysit it
We need more emcees and less wannabes
Three hundred and sixty degrees of reality
that's what its all about
Kill em and haul em out
Now feel the aim of the name you haters callin out

My life like a Hitchcock flick, stick to the script
If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick
How she actin off of the fifth?  Ridiculous shit
We don't need conversation, just crowd participation
If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations
Seperate myself from y'all, segregation
Tryin to stop Xzibit and Dre?  Humiliation
Pure elevation, got me some inspiration
Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation
Got a live occupation, live for the moment
I'm faced with an altercation manhandlin my opponents

This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon
I think I'll stop shootin you niggaz and shoot for the moon

Whatever the fuck they wanna do, huh, sad but true
Wanna take another life like it's the thing to do

Ride wit me, lemme take you somewhere

My father was a soldier, my mother was a rider
I was born wit my fists balled up, I'ma fighter
Inspired, a real rhyme writer
Get past the past the future looks brighter
But, I want to get it back to the way it was
Exchange blows, elbows and it was still love
A better time, better place in space
Cause nothin can erase, shame tat' like my nigga Chase
Cause Bigga be	 will never be replaced, right
And I'ma scream it to the whole fuckin human race
Get a bar, get a taste
Enforce the muscle to ya hustle and ya did it with grace
Cause real niggaz don't save face, they make movements
Back to the time when hip-hop was music
When N.W.A. got booed at the Apollo
Broke ""Straight Outta Compton"" and the whole world followed
Cause right now hip-hop is hollow
With no substance, X-Man with the roughness
Cause success can suck sometime
And many of us the way we act, we even lost our minds

[Chorus]
You can hold your breath, 'til your blue in the face
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on (now sing the song wit me)
You can speculate, on every breath I take
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on

Back to the day when +Cooley+ was +High+
Hustle big like Butch in the why-be	-I
We did it 'n died, the gang still multiplied
Sock yo windpipe, cut yo air supply
Hypnotized, not by the glitz 'n glamour
So fuck them cameras, all I need is clips and hammers
The X-Man said that the first rhyme out
Were my fans worth my time? The first line out, so
Here we are eight years strong and still movin
Groovin with a reputation ya can't ruin
I want to take it back how it used to be
Five thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity

[Chorus]

Was it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame
that made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?
Played those games nigga when I was younger in life
'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife
Lose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us
Ya can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us
When times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic
Never been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard
But I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor
I never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster
I move in silence, speak with violence
Think with science, live free and walk with lions
Cats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat
It takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Pounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about
It's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth
It's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out
Don't let the things that you can't change stress you out
Cause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son
And change the world with the power of one c'mon

Sniff white lines off powerful men
But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got class
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash

It take everything she got not to relaspe

He was on his own, at a very young age
When he learned from the streets, made everything change
See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin
I ain't talkin paper like Jigga or Dre
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit
Now his mother work for minimum pay
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun
In the streets, jackin niggaz for fun
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him

Ate with his right and made money with his left hand
Prayed to the East, 5 times daily
His mother and father just had a new born baby
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith
Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor
He heard about the buildings on 9-11
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam
Wit 88 thousand tons of missile and bombs
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... damn

You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame
One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff
I was only fifteen, tryin to pass that rock
Never got caught, just sat down, collected my thoughts
This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat
I'm just another nigga sellin some coke, y'know?
Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote
My callin for ballin wasn't peddling dope
It was oversea convoys, bangin out cuts
No police or government agency lockin me up, so what?

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
C'mon..
What do you believe in? I believe in karma
And that fo'-five to drop that drama
Can't wait for the time when I meet my maker
Picture everlasting life in Jamaica, time to wake up
Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words
Your words become actions when the bullshit happens
Keep laughin, that's when the gauge start clackin
Feel the buckshots smackin have your body mismatchin
Yo, I feel the devil tryin to force my hand
Steady bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man
See I was born to be all that I can, without a Uncle named Sam
As you can see we just a part of his plan
'Cause first there was a war on blacks
And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in Iraq, c'mon
I never give up, I only give back
I ain't preachin I'm just statin the facts
So let the choir sing!

[Chorus]",Judgement Day,2004

It seem like the whole world waitin on the West coast

Strong Arm Steady we ready it's time to ball out
When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out
Industry tried to pigeonhole, I had to crawl out
Hear my name bein called out, nuclear fallout
Full body armor with bangers, we goin all out
Garbage bags in trunk of the car, it won't stall out
Hit you where you stay, hogtied, you gettin hauled out
Crush the whole car, it's well planned and thought out
Try to attain fame from beef, you went the wrong route
Scrape a 38 on your teeth, I knock 'em all out
I know you ain't fuckin with me dawg (c'mon NOW)
Underestimate, run up on, it's on now
Have your niggaz plottin revenge and puttin songs out
Demise by design, blueprints is drawn out
Flood crack back in the hood, it's been a long drought
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
KLACK - for the niggaz that bang in the inner city and
KLACK - for the enemies creepin to come and get me
Be thankful, if you get away alive
You wouldn't kill or won't let nothin die, so keep it movin

[Xzibit]
Yo! You don't like how I'm livin well FUCK YOU
Nastradamus style, make every line come through
Don't make me spit predict your last action
Last man standin (yeah) last man laughin (yeah)
Assassin, crosshairs, smile for the birdie (CLICK!)
Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!)
Knock the soul out of your body, stay plottin like Bin Laden
to swoop down and crash your party
All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga
We bite to the white then shake 'til the afterlife
Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?
Make you want to drop e'rything and move to Cali
We classic, go 'head, speak my name
And I'ma lay your ass down like the All Star game, c'mon

[Chorus]

[possibly Strong Arm - uncredited]
Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade
Bitch-made niggaz get, hit with a hand grenade
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road
and I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke
Everytime, I use the element of surprise
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we
came a long way from po-lice chasin us
for dope in our socks and angel dust
Yeah klack for the strippers in clubs shakin they titties

That's quick to have that baby
And that try to squeeze you
For every penny that you thought of makin'

These streets is fuckin' viscious
Can't make the wrong decisions
They have you shot up
And shot up, caught up behind some bitches

Handle your business homie
'Cause ain't no homies in business
So many people in this business
Be so fuckin' phony

I see right through them traps
These niggaz run their yaps
But when it really cracked
Them pussy niggaz runnin' laps

I clap 'em in they tracks
My paper come in stacks
And stacks of rubberbands
Thicker than a paperback

We got them lovers right
They want to catch ya
Get naked begin to spend the night

Here you go some good advice
Come through steppin' light
Believe me, extremely easy
To lose your life

Get 'em up and keep 'em up
They tryin' to get me touched
If you gonna swing it nigga
Bring it I don't give a fuck!

It's Strong Arm and Jelly Roll, cool for real
Yeah motherfucker, why don't you just chill
Cause I'm just coolin at the spot
Ain't much wrong plus you're makin it hot
I like shinin from all the grindin
Girl's best friend, man I'm just like diamonds
I like khakis and Air Force Ones
Gangsters in the hood with them air force guns
We poppin them tags, our pockets fat
We fin' to put the world in a shopping bag
Nigga X the man, and I'm the man
We tryin to make you love it, don't you understand?

[Chorus]
If you're with Strong Arm, you're really down with us
If you get high, then get a blunt and roll it up
Your hood's gon' ride, then let me see you throw it up
If you ready I'm ready see really we don't give a fuck
Get'cha ass up if you're really down with us
Girl you ain't cute, get on the floor and move your butt
The bar is open everybody's gettin drunk
If you're ready I'm ready see really we don't give a fuck

[Xzibit]
Another night in L.A., the homies all valet
We got it lookin the dub show in front of the place
Strong Arm + 75, we so deep we arrive
and then we swarm like you fucked with the hive
Gotta look a nigga right in the eyes, to tell the truth and the lies
Even the strong find it hard to survive
Another day another dollar we can walk on water
Better, drop your tone, you ain't nobody's father
Hotter than about a buck shot your carne asada
X burn down the town like a path of lava
Pathological drama so we got it inside
Is it the wine or the women it's so hard to decide
Look alive it's crackin; this is organized street hustlin
with corporate backin promotin interstate traffic (traffic)
Classic, smash out right
Cause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night

[Interlude]
Cause I, can get yo' ass on the floor
Cause this, is this the funk that you want?
The hand, it comes way up in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't caaaaaaaaare
Bitch, come off of those pots
Stop, shake that junk in your trunk
See you, can move this groovyville shit
The shake that makes the whollllle club flip

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
You might get shot in the face if you don't stay in your place
You ain't a soldier like me you a fuckin disgrace
X move like a shark in the water, I'm dodgin death and disorder
I'll get you hit it won't cost me a quarter
I was sent here to strangle and slaughter in no particular order
Your big mouth might endanger your daughter
Another day another digit I'ma speak it and live it
Better get yourself a gun 'fore you fuck with Xzibit
Pockets shorter than a midget, you can fuckin forget it
X green light the target and easily hit it
Grab the zone and split it so we smokin them woods
Steady givin niggaz the business and keepin it hood
Firearms we packin, this is military mindstate
that's ready for action we mercenaries and assassins (blastin)
Clashin, smash out right
Cause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night

Let's hit the club and get it on tonight
Let's get drunk this is Saturday Night
Just got paid, shine my chrome up tight
Time to get it crackin, off the Henn' tonight

I've been low, now check my highs
Million dollar niggaz right before yo' eyes

On some straight motherfuckin pimpin shit, why'knahmean?",Saturday Night Live,2004
Xzibit,"Yeah, check it out, they say behind every strong man
Is an even stronger woman

[Chorus]
Cause she, was put here to defeat me
Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need
Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me
Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need

Man, X aint' with that sucka shit
I'm from a place, where they quick to say ""Fuck A Bitch""
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman
I got twenty twenty cord vision, seein' you comin'
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace
You ain't the one for me!

[Chorus]

You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up
The ATF hit the house, had me shackled up
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man
I understand that you love me and you want the best
But if you want to take the good, you gotta take the rest
I rock a vest, baby!

Cause I, run these streets for my struggle
Cause I, carry heat for my troubles
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?
Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'
Cause I, want futures for my children
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?

And all this time it was you
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I pursue
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin' a clue
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you
It's so true, behind every great man is a women
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin'
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down
You always given me another reason, I can smile
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree
Ugh, nothin' can stop us now, Vera Wang gown
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle
Cause you the one for me!

Cause she, was put here to complete me
Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need
Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me
Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need

All the time neph', I gotta let my nuts hang

Baby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that
Whatever you send us my nucca, we gon' send it back
I'm in the club with the snub gettin' love
With 20,000 Crips and 20,000 Bloods and
We don't give a fuck about none of y'all
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Bigg Dogg
I done seen niggas hit L.A. and get they chain snatched
Then they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back
What I look like, the motherfuckin' police?
There's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit

Wassup? We need to talk
Let me light my backport
(lights up)
(exhales)
That's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown

Yo, I love Los Angeles, you can hear it in my music
Plus I got the scars to prove it
And man.. you don't understand what I understand
I'm feelin like a piece to a bigger plan
'Cause all I'm sayin is the God honest truth of it all, we fightin the wrong enemy
That's why I'm gettin invovled, it's just like the end of that movie ""Saw""
When them two chained up guys met with their demise
And the mastermind was layin there the whole time
Remember that? That's why we have to sit down
And speak about the black and the brown
Now I didn't come here to point no fingers
I know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations
Shit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations
And everybody lose.. from the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it's even the high schools
'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News
when the students squared off and one kid wouldn't choose sides
Hit with a hammer and the kid died and now it's a full blown riot
Tck, that's when the fists start flyin
These kids ain't learnin shit about math and science
Man..

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Tension is so thick, some are comin around
I don't wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now.. that's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Eighty percent of inmates are black and Hispanic
They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit.. that's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown

[Xzibit]
Yo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day
He came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey
And he don't really fuck with nobody outside of the set
It's tatted big on his neck
Y'know? So over the years, built respect and trust
Some black and brown issues we both discussed
He said, ""Homes, it's been goin down too long
I gotta bang on them fools and it don't feel wrong""
""They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks
So word came down, we gotta handle that shit""
""Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts
Can I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin""
At first, I remind him of what vengeance do
What vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to
He wasn't tryna hear that shit
He just turned up the volume, bangin 50 Cent

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
I got soldiers from both sides who really don't care
Who identify themselves by the colors they wear
The homey came through to put one in the air
I can tell somethin was wrong the way he sat in his chair
He said, ""X, man I'm just gettin out
from doin eighty eight months, tryna figure things out""
He told me in the pen you get down to get done
'Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one
He showed me the scar on his gut and his neck
They got him good, said he damn near bled to death
The hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes
When he described what it feels like to almost die
All I could do was just sit back and listen
'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions
I got hit with a bottle but I'm not dead
I said, ""Think with your heart homey, not your head""
I said

Oooooh you must defend yourself (Yeah!)
If you don't, then no one else (Nobody!)
Your homies got to ride (Let's go!)
You're fighting for your life (Yeah!)

Yeah, blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up
I'm alge-ballin', dumb niggaz can't add it up
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin' up
All these rappers comin' out, ain't nobody showin' up

Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at
You the king of the streets? Well, I ain't heard none of that
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, 'Did it My Way'

I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide
Recognize, lost a lotta love when my momma died
Did a gang of shit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive

Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize

Drop like a guillotine, money over everythin'

Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship
Came a long way from the place that I started from
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?

Hate manifest from the inside out
The shit starts in your heart, then spill out your mouth
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out
I see you tryin' to stand up but you don't stand out

Now that I found that my path is original
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle
I'm not like you, but you think we identical
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal

It's not for niggaz 'cause George Bush comin' after us

Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it

Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, overkill shit

Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit
You know that young shit, the 'Hey nigga, where you from?' shit

Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand

(Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital
Huh, gutter never takin' me under
Fuckin' nerve of you motherfuckers
Thinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers
X went off the deep end, I'm determined you motherfuckers
So watch how you speakin'
Cause I'm listenin' closely for any pussy approachin' me

[Chorus]

Nigga, you better come with the Taliban
Never been a slave or afraid of another man
X move like the brutal force of an avalanche
It ain't my fault you smoked off your chance
See motherfuckers envy what they cannot be
Mr. X to the Z, H.N.I.C.
Shh, half assed niggaz gon' shit on me
If they sentence me to five I'll be out in three
You'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat
Tucked in for eternity, time to sleep
Til' that day, I'll crush everything in my way
And give a fuck about what y'all say

See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall, thanks to y'all
(Niggas talkin' like bitches)
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be, but you ain't no G
(Niggas talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me
(Niggas talkin' like bitches)

[Chorus:]
I just wanna thank you, for bein' around
And patiently waitin' and holdin' me down
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me
I just wanna thank you, for bein' a fan
And watchin' me grow from a boy to a man
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me

You 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard
With all of these rappers pullin' triggers and flippin' birds
I know it sound absurd, cause they don't tell the truth
They prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth
But yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above
No matter my faults still continue to show me love
Naw I ain't perfect man, but yet I stay the same
I play chess not checkers but this is not a game
And this is not a song, and this is not a verse
It's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed
Spent the first half of my life, thinkin' that I was cursed
Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse
That wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade
Makin' it what it's supposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me
All these people approaching me, don't even know the half
I could be facin' life but X is signin' autographs, damn

[Chorus]

My son's 11 now, I got to see him grow
Makin' his free throws, the way he laughin' at the show
Yo he remind me of me, when I was ridin' bikes
He gonna' be taller than me, he got my mother's height
But yo you know the difference, between me and them others
They say you buggin' when I call you my sisters and brothers
I coulda' missed it all, I coulda' dropped the ball
Mind of Metallica, motherf*** 'em and ""kill 'em all""
I used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets
I used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef
Most of my homies is gone, restin' in peace
Some'll never see release from custody of police, but me
But nah my little dude get to go to private school
And I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do
That's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you
Support from you and yours, thank you for gettin' me through, true

[Chorus]

We buried Proof today, it really broke me up
To see my brother in that casket, man what the fuck?
Media made me angry, I had to soak it up
The future is fragile never promised to none of us
Hittin' so close to home, but what I focused on
Is how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone
We never walk alone, although sometime it seems
That nightmares go hand in hand with livin' out dreams
So let me take this time, from my struggle my grind
To let you know that I appreciate you by my side
It's been a long ride, a lot of long nights
A lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice
A soldier of fortune fearless fightin' the good fight
I never had a plan be, I never lost sight
That's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill the mic
It's for my fans that's ridin' with Xzibit for life, right

[Chorus]

Thank you, for lettin' me breathe
For lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh

I'm the hardest cold-hearted artist, the coast is clear

Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo' system
I be swimmin' through these women, man, fuck 'em and flip 'em

Caught with the product that them young niggaz sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggaz have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, ""NOT GUILTY!!!""

They used to have me on that paperwork
'cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
'Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggaz is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house 'cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggaz down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit be - burn the rubber on the West coast

I wonder why the fuck are they followin' me
I seem them niggaz creepin' two cars behind me
You'll never catch me slippin', just me and my piece
You must be smokin' if you think I'ma call the police

I'm a beast, still got a crease
Still got my Converse thumpin' down the concrete
Black and blue Bugatti
This is Strong Arm robbery, you can't deny me

My garage, a mirage, a collage of chrome
I look alive with the nine when I leave my home
Been on tour in Japan, been relaxed in Rome
This is grown man business, recognize the tone

If I don't recognize the number, won't answer my phone
Rockin' every area code, still stay in my zone
I don't play no fuckin' games now, bitch, I'm grown
Now I crack your fuckin' neck to the shit I'm on, yeah

Six-four, chromed out, ragtop rollin'
Get your weight up 'cause X can't stop rollin'
Niggaz thought it was over but X came back rollin'
I got my own sack to roll, so I'm rollin'

Yeah, my release bang through the streets
We hang like orangutans, mangle the beat
Niggaz hatin', gravitatin' to the lies that they tell
My reality takin' over where that fiction fail

What the hell, might as well show the cards I'm holdin'
Sweet taste, aromatic, backwood rollin'
Got the Range Rover supercharged, complete with the strut kit
My chain hang to my dang-a-lang, what the fuck, bitch?

Boomerang my change, I rearrange some thangs
My slang, click, bang and expose they brains
Then I pray, “Our Father who art in Heaven”
Got people jumpin' out the buildin' like 9/11

Malcolm X to the Z, landin' on them like Plymouth Rock
You get knocked out, get socked in your fuckin' mouth
Now e'rybody know the business, you want it, come get it
But if you rollin', throw it up, let me know that you with it

Six-four, chromed out, ragtop rollin'
Get your weight up 'cause X can't stop rollin'

I got my own sack to roll, so I'm rollin'

Yeah, I repeat my name over beats
I binge on the finer things, you cringe in defeat
Escalation, elevation to another plateau
Sometimes it take a few steps back to mentally grow

Here we go, what you know? Campaign in motion
Straight West Coast and West worldwide rollin'
Got that Aston Martin DV9 equipped with a stash box
In case I ever find myself alone in a tight spot

Strip down my frame, repave my lane
Insane with my ink pen, Citizen Kane
Don't complain when the chamber slide back and bang
Make it taste like shit when you sayin' my name

It's the Golden State heavyweight, holdin' the belt
'Cause I'm a one man army, I don't need no help
This is a pistol, I use to protect myself
Careful these hammerhead hollow points
Is bad for your health, my nia

Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keepin my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night

Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You goin' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lock down facilities
Bitches be, quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin up and down my dick like the stock exchange

I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Ravel your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

Makin it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect

Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot, and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle

My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck
It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up
Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit
Let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

[Chorus]

Raised in the gutter bread getting butter
Face like her mother ass like she's southern
So much cash I just gotta laugh
Out in Paris smoking grass signing autographs
It's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring
If it's shining then I'm near it
It's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point
Pop another bottle roll another joint
And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG
I'm way too high to be low key
Better act like you know me

[Chorus]

Girl if you wanna get some drunk then cutie it come and get it from me
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this Hennessy
But we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink beer
Party like there's not a night put a one night before that bitch
We don't sleep until we get sick we gon' blaze till we get licked
Call Earl the world spinning talking jail we winning
The girl that you love is good in the beginning
Two good shots and not a girl singing
Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts
More murrr
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

Xzibit,"[Chorus]
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything

My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out
Picking the shit up where I left off
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me
And make that money stack higher than giraffes

[Chorus]

I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack
So it will leave no shells at the scene
Where I was getting my kid back
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up
On hard to make the west defined a united fund
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California
Where people fake it 'till they make it
Or take it with their hand gun
Take your chances, swing, try to land one
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness
My symphony deliver something classic
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back
Gave my girl a son and my last name

[Chorus]

Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors
You mold them and lead them, fuck the positive message
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy

Bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite
Homie, pass me a light, I got that master kush
Gave birth to you, bastards, told your momma the bush

My prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long
Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate
I wait my banner a piece, won't you take the paper
Pussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face
Hit you with the cage, back in place

Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
I'm going forever be me, never, I'm forever a GE
All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
Smoking this weed, smoking is good
But I got what you need
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made
Won't you change, I want you stay the same
But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
I'm going forever be me, never, I'm forever a G

It's getting hard to survive the streets that eat you alive
Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies
Too much rats are trapped inside of your rapping
Niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action
Do you, do you?
Whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
Because when I bring it to the whole court
Putting up a play of stats
While you're hanging with the roaches and rats
We're way above that
Now how you're loving that?
Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
I can't breathe, can't make it your bitch
Can't believe how deep in your shit
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

[Chorus]

The greatest trip that devil ever put together
Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
I see the down could crawl, quickly spreading like gun infection
And miss it after live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through
Shoul've been a screen play when I get to
More niggas away, IET, quit playing games in the middle of the street
Fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?
We don't play the games, just play for keeps and now
Back for the forth fly, back to the back who was back with a tour bus
Get it round the world for a few months
Down dead, way niggas gotta dumb trunk
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor
Linking in Japan, I am here, got the gangsta for all your chain chains
March to the heart beat of the city
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks
It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck
I never worry about the referee, the gate keepers keep him locked for me
Push all to shallow, forever
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?
Hit the park, build at the car scene, blowing red everywhere
Look how strong we are
So there will be no war or shots
I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke than a power water drill
Concentration, determination
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration

Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I
Gangsters, gangsters
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am

They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace
Then walk into the light
My soul want me take it without a fight
She says she wanna spend the whole life
But she only got me here for one night
Said it's time, better get it in. Call your best friend
I'm a call you wonder-twins
Stop and go like red light traffic, innovation made it another classic
We made it happen
And big hip hop want us gut cut
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up
Another game fucked up, because the lanes clocked up
But the content sucks
I wanna fill up some big red trucks, tour then through
The whole world, motherfuckers lining up
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap
You're tying west coast around my back
And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that

[Chorus]

Can't even rely on your own eyes, everything fake now
Toast to the bad guys
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes
Part machine, part skill, part intuition
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front
Caught there, they try to tear me down
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it, the focus study my literature
Clean house, taking out the trash. I'm in the fly zone

Measure your height and your weight to break your neck with your hand
Sometimes they use a shore drop or they use a crane
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain
But if the calculations ain't correct when the rope's set
The rope will rip the head right off the motherfucker's neck
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows
With a vendetta beetle who wanna battle
Man you gon' get whipped in flaw shackle to an A-frame
Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name
Till you smell the smell of burn and flesh
Keep you alive until you pray for death
Drawn in the corner disembowel until there's nothing left
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death
Li chin translated this the leader in death
A rubber tie filled with gas around your arms and chest
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess
Ask the AT about the south African necklace
Go ahead and pick your poison it was coming to you

Have must I come through merciless
Be quick with that bullshit you heard of
Uncut mole what have we ride through
And always remember that death will come off swift wings
Anyone who run contested now know have we now picked you whatever
I came to peel

Hands behind your back shackled then I forced you to kneel
Shoot you in the back of the head send your family the bill
For what the bullets cost I'm on my China shit
Eye for an eye waterboard you like my government
Impaled and left at the front gates
Used to hear the sound of broken arms rib and leg makes
Whipping and pull apart call it the breaking wheel
By inquisition espanish mi corazon is free
No compassion don't expect it when I fucking see you
Lethal injections is my profession loading up my needles
My iron maiden the Caucasian the Asian
The information received by the ancient art of persuasion
I'm 'bout to drop like a guillotine

I'm sorry I met you
I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you
I'm sorry I murked you
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

For me we are the same should be laughed at
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so christian I'm so muslim
Super size on your mom trigger get push up
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon

[Chorus]

I feel so guilty my hands are filthy
From decorating your face all over the building
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong

Have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from every once came
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi

Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out
And I just sold out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we be on that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now

That we all fight similar self aided mutilation

Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart cold and in gut metal I didn't survive at all

Let me tell why you these hypocrites and half wits
Caught up into politics
Worked yourself to death but uncle Sammy is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology surveillance's a bitch
And everyone one of us some of us got no heart or no back bone

The woman you lust for is usually not the one to stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for em attacking the land lords
'Cause the shit too high we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die may it not be in vain more
Importantly more to see keep it cracking orderly

It's just me and my bitch

When I was injured I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears my nose and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children

I had to get stronger I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard

Let me tell you about these long days of sleepless nights
Penny pension trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on into your destiny and set the stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live out loud make it no regrets
This for the set this for the ones that never waken up
Living a fantasy insanity is fake as fuck
They out of touch they out of line it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains misery eventually found the fountain of youth
It's been pissed in, shit in violated till they pollute

The best help that you can do is help yourself
You gotta step up you gotta find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it because you know you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in the road
Yeah you're gonna be stuck in that bad place it's depressing

And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all
Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn
I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Average for an arsonist, tagging up the apocalypse
The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite
All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments
The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious
This is for the populous, population genocide

Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise
When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind

Gonna be removed when the clips just slap
You and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back

Something more, something more than faith
Something more, something more than fairy tales
Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life
Touched in all the stray, but bound he pound his way
And so he shines so bright in the sky

My hip hop is outstanding, outlasting
Already all stars, they fizz a lot fast week
Burn like the sun and you suck like a black hole
Stuck in my style and get over my flat
This colors don't run, we attract you
Drama like madness, you wanna get your head flew
Incredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme
I'm not the average, no one's back home
Super rap killer, extremely great spitter
Make a door, hit the door, solve the queen's riddle
Sinister, ailing off the bank with the sickest
So get up and get down with the sickness
This is something more than just songs
I wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with
Better lines than them, they crush their dreams
And attempt to my sport when I do this thing

Something more, something more than faith
Something more, something more than fairy tales
Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life
Touched in all the stray, but bound he pound his way
And so he shines so bright in the sky

What you know about dead money and sacrifice?
What you know about people scheming and take your life?
What you know about these Cali G's?
That mister penitenciary invested movement on a bigger better day
What you know about the harder man?
We paint the outer water décor to the promised land
You understand, is in my nature not to walk away
'Cause I'm a beast, my beats are open up your chest in face
Call the police, it's still the same and I don't give a fuck
I speak the truth and all my catalogs are living trust
Now give it up and get it, take it at gun point
We cut broke niggas in what point
You gonna realize we came for
Something more than fairy tales
Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life",Something More,2012
Xzibit,"I'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it
Try the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood
Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood
I'm a rhyme for my people, give my people a voice
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron
The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones
Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind
Put my motherfucker records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, bring the one and the same
Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain
So now

[Chorus]
Let's spread it out, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
It go oooo, oooo
And you can't get none, you don't want none
You can't get none
Spread the fuck out, gets these hot ones

I try not to get involved with the nonsense
I'm from the time where you couldn't pause comments
Couldn't hide behind a computer
Catch a fatal get shot by a shooter
A barracuda for Buddha
I maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion
My bad, sorry for all the confusion
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done
The saga continue, bring it back on the one
I'm coming back with a gun, cause I saw that I know
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?
I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction
They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be

[Chorus]

This go for all my people, people who see we're equal
I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil
We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion
People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere
Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain
Children retain, remember living upon the pain
That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same
Yeah, so spread it out, nigga

[Chorus]",Spread It Out,2012
Xzibit,"[Chorus]
Sometimes it all just come together, you know?
I put my city on my back, now
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided trough the struggle, we fall
Got my city on a map, now
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all
You gotta stand tall

To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates
Burn the back wood, burn it back to your fingertips
Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment
You couldn’t have told me none of this back in ’96
The ability to crawl upon the bottom, this bitch
This is our time I’m spending mine up in this bitch
I still remember the very moment I was enlisted
I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business
And when there’s blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters
They wanna debate on television about the victim
Right or wrong, Treyfa was my little man
I would take a chainsaw to z...? my man

[Chorus]

For all the moments I wasted on making others happy
Attack me, I’m bulletproof, tag me, I’ve seen the virus through
I never lied to you, still rolling with golden views
Spend every word and I mean it, mean it and I really buy to you
'Cause I'd rather be in hell than a jail cell
I’m hancock, superheroes lend me cocktails
I never feel, don’t try to patronize me
I learn, I’m painfully aware of everything in my surroundings
I am shaved, fully shining, never touched the silver lightning
The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds
I hear my city calling, here come the jogging
Now are twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot

[Chorus]

So, failure ain't an option
How do you think I made it out that corner apartment?
Turn my corner to my market, and now I target the same niggas
That taught on all that dumb shit
Because when the gun clicking
That bullet leaving can’t get that life back
Karma is a bitch and believe me, she’ll get it right back
They say that success is the best revenge
But who really wins if we all die in the end
If I had it all, then I probably wouldn’t pray the same
And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain
My name good in every corner in my city
You don’t believe me, then come fuck with me

[Chorus]",Stand Tall,2012
Xzibit,"Man, I'm talking about that six four rag top
Green, with the back racked
Everything mat black, caught it in a six pack
You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do
Now put your hands up in the air, like I'm about to shoot
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothing to fear
We have nothing to lose, pressure applying the rules
Wasp on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs
Every bad bitch you can think of
Swagged out, locked out, flamed on, purve out
Shit face from shots, your words come swirled up
Better put the word out, mind I find the mediocre
I'm a bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers
You can fuck around, who else get the fly
You know I asked your little mind is your prime world dying over

[Chorus]
Order in the court, that's what you came to see
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z
Not a verdict to see, just the moment of truth
Fighting the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot
I be my own attorney, watching you try to burn me down
Testimony testifier from the underground
Order in the court, that's what you came to see
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z

I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart
I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart
I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change
Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim
That means I can arrange haters and hideous things
I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein
Paranormal presence to people who can never explain
Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same
I got a proposition for all you bitches listening
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion
Give you what you've been missing
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system
I got a fetish for fucking over my opposition
It's time to set the standing, the mother ship is landing
We didn't come here in peace, we're here to take the player

[Chorus]

I came up with the wolf, they came out with them tools
Elevate you out the earth gravitational pool
This is not for the week, this time works for the streets
Mister X to the Z, motherfuck, what you think?
Motherfuck, what you blog, this for my loss and my dogs
Standing tall, still calling shots from behind the wall
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do
Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements
You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit
Dreams splattered and broken never breaking my spirit
Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future
Ain't no time like the present, live the past and excuses
Fucked on anything, fuck it, I keep it exclusive
You just saw as if acoustic, this that real nigga music",State of Hip Hop vs. Xzibit,2012

With the French blue pack, with that French blue

I got that rag top Impala with the French blue back
Could you loan me a dollar? Bitch, I can't do that
Got a flight in an hour, got my bags all packed
Bring it in for the huddle a hundred and 50 bags pow
Want me to take ya to the club and throw it on the ground?
Instead I can't get by, fin this make you double girl

Shake, what you gon shake the city? Clearly you are from outta town
I made my scraper catch your paper on the turf
Stackin' yaper like a Laker, hit exactly where it hurts
Better put that shit in reverse, you might cross over the ledge
The king of the castle swingin' screamin' ""off with they heads! ""
Round up and raggel your ratchets
Mad cause they given aside shit
Fuck it, we keep it, we mack it

Prouder than a hippie, fuckin' hella pussy
Everybody tipsy, feelin' hyper tripy
My wrist real brisky icy

'Cause their wife want me to pichy
But only since 19-90
Body body boom boom

Me and a few of my goonsie
Alcohol consuming
When I raisin' the grip, when these fin niggas
About to hit you in the head
Better pack astroclickers

Thousands on thousands on thousands
Relentless, put the pousie

Then let me pound on your pussy and knock it out of place
I wanna hook you and book you, hedges sometimes the face

Ball it up, bring it all with me
Call it an audible hit me

I'm crawling like Pauline LeBailey, bouncing around the city
Pity you feelin' shitty
It's 25 to life for this pushin'
And spike off did anybody hit by a sniper
Live the rest of your life in a diper or chill the fuck out
Oh you can walk? Better keep walkin' or they could carry you out
This is the end of the drought, homies is bouncing around me
Too many 0's to count, I let these women surround me
Jump off their clothes to give mouth
But then they never confine me

Already showed you the route

Xzibit,"It burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear
You were never free, and you never realized
And love, is a word you've never heard
Your heart is cold cause it burns, the desire to leave the mind

Take your breath til nothing's left
Stars of life upon your chest
And I know you wherever you go

And we run and we don't look back
And we run til we've had enough
And we run, tell me how to run
And we run, til we break down
And we run til we fall apart

And we run, for this killing love
And we run, tell me how it's enough
And we run, far ahead we go

I'ma break these chains, ran through the rain
Never looked back, never quit, worked through the pain
This blood in my veins run cold when I hate
Give enough to keep sane but I never lose hope
This is my time now, no time for tears to celebrate
Put it in the air right now
Never back down, you'll never wear my crown 
cause it weighs too much and I crush every motherfucking thing I touch
This is what I've never loved so much
Get involved what's the worst stand up
Here my mic before I ever get far
Man in lights, you lost all my trust
Now it's time to face all of us
Get in line just to spar with us
And it feels so far from us, just take my hand and run

Xzibit,"All my life, I've been down to ride
Till I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and being between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life

You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where the niggas load clips and fats
And get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbanin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life, you never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

R.I.P to KMG
Still gotta murder rap, and don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building I just give a fuck where the money at
They coaching the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays and if you get a train better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta, y'all testin my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a capre

(Wait, hold up I got next)
(What up X)
Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, oh you fucks guess what, I'm ready to blow
(Yo, oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors scrapin' bumpin' in the driveway
You gave me the pistol told me to kill at will
(Blow, yo, oh no)
(I couldn't give a fuck)
Literally, cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities
(Well I don't know what you know
But I know I got that shit)
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitches niggas from runnin' their mouth
(It's bout time somebody said something)

One in the glove, one in the clip, one in the chamber
One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger
I'm ready to die I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit, somebody better fuckin' stop me
Cause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself I'm bad for my own health
You niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else (fuck em')
