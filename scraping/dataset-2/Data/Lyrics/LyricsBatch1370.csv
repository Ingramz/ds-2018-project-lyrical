C. Jérôme,"Le souffle court de tes mots
Quand tu murmures « te quiero »
Tes chuchotements interdits
Ta voix tellement sensuelle
Si belle et rebelle
Le goût secret de ta peau
Cuando besa me mucho
Quand tu te parfumes d’envie
Ma bouche est folle sur tes lèvres
Tes baisers me donnent la fièvre
Quand tu frissonnes de partout
Ça me rend complètement fou

Tout au bout de nos nuits blanches
Y’a des matins bleus
Et des soleils de dimanche
Qu’on voit dans nos yeux
De l’amour en avalanche
Fou et amoureux
A t’empêcher de dormir
A en crever de désir
De tes regards, tes sourires
De nos deux cœurs qui chavirent
Te retenir et crier
A en mourir prisonnier
De tes soupirs, tes baisers
De nos deux corps enchainés

Un long frisson tout à coup
Quand on est joue contre
Tu me caresses du bout des doigts
Tu te blottis contre moi
Je te serre dans mes bras
Le feu qui brûle ton regard
Quand dans tes yeux je m’égare
Lorsque tu as chaud en toi
Ton corps enlacé au mien
Mes mains au creux de tes reins
Y’a plus rien qui nous retient
On se sent tellement bien",Nuits Blanches,
C. Jérôme,"Tu sais, j'ai laissé passer les années, c'est vrai
Avant de te téléphoner, oui mais
Chagrin passé ne laisse que des regrets

Qui sait, qui de nous deux est amoureux secret
Les larmes aux yeux, les rêves à l'imparfait
Si c'est un jeu, j'ai dû le jouer distrait

Refrain:
Pleure pas pour moi
Ce que j'étais n'était pas moi
A la même heure, au même endroit
Je suis différent d'autrefois
Pleure pas pour moi
La reine a fait tomber le roi
Ce que je suis tu n'y crois pas
Cette eau de pluie n'est pas pour toi
Pleure pas pour moi

Tu sais, ce qui a été ne revient jamais
Les nuits d'été, les vieux slows en anglais
Il faudrait arrêter le temps, faudrait

Qui sait, se retrouver avant où l'on dansait
Et se dire tu t'en souviens quand on s'aimait
Ce n'est plus qu'un souvenir désormais, eh

Refrain

On a tous, quelque part dans le coeur
Un souvenir caché
On a tous, tous les jours, toute la vie
Pour toujours y penser

Refrain",Pleure Pas Pour Moi,
C. Jérôme,"D'illusions perdues en soleil d'hiver
Elle ne voulait plus revivre un enfer
Des histoires vécues au goût de Lucifer
Elle aurait voulu un amour sans guerre
Ils ne connaissaient pas encore bien l'amour
Et ils pensaient qu'ils s'aimeraient pour toujours
Même s'ils n'avaient jamais osé se parler
Se parler

Ils se sont rencontrés à la terrasse d'un café
Ils se sont embrassés là dans la cour du lycée
Ils se sont aimés durant tout l'été
Ils se sont quittés juste à la rentrée …

Des rêves brisés, les matins de pluie
Il avait pleuré des filles de la nuit
Des paradis roses dans ses yeux bleus gris
Y'avait quelque chose pour une love story
Ils ne connaissaient pas encore bien l'amour
Et ils pensaient qu'ils s'aimeraient pour toujours
Même s'ils n'avaient jamais osé se parler
Se parler

Ils se sont rencontrés à la terrasse d'un café
Ils se sont embrassés là dans la cour du lycée
Ils se sont aimés durant tout l'été
Ils se sont quittés juste à la rentrée ...",Le Temps d'un Été,

C. Jérôme,"Tu n'as jamais dansé 
Aussi bien que ce soir 
Je regarde briller 
Tes cheveux blonds dans le noir 

Tu n'as jamais souri 
Si tendrement je crois 
Tu es la plus jolie 
Tu ne me regardes pas 

Et tu danses avec lui 
La tête sur son épaule 
Tu fermes un peu les yeux 
C'est ton plus mauvais rôle 

Et tu danses avec lui 
Abandonnée, heureuse 
Tu as toute la nuit 
Pour en être amoureuse 

Je suis mal dans ma peau 
J'ai envie de partir 
Il y a toujours un slow 
Pour me voler ton sourire 

Et tu flirtes avec lui 
Moi, tout seul, dans mon coin 
Je n'sais plus qui je suis 
Je ne me souviens plus de rien 

Et tu danses avec lui 
La tête sur son épaule

Paroles de Didier Barbelivien et Jean Albertini
Musique de Didier Barbelivien

Y a des cafés dans les gares
Et des châteaux sur les bords de la Loire
A l'Élysée, un président Giscard qui s'y trouve bien
Y a des villes de Hlm
Pas de pétrole pour nos autos, dondène
On a gardé, l'Alsace et la Lorraine que je connais bien.
On a des politiciens à succès
On a Sylvie et Johnny Hallyday
On a la deux chevaux et les grands couturiers

Le charme français, du Nord en Provence
Oui, c'est l'accordéon sur lequel on danse
C'est une gauloise et une blonde à la fois
Le charme français, plutôt romantique
Fait passer l'amour avant la musique
Mais, c'est bien connu, on ne pense qu'à ça

Y a du bon pain de campagne
Des chapeaux ronds dans toute la Bretagne
Et puis Paris sera toujours Panam' et ça c'est très bien
Y a la Corse et le soleil
On joue aux boules du côté de Marseille
Chez nous les filles sont toujours les plus belles et on le sait bien
On est pas les rois du sport mais on a
St Etienne et Poulidor, c'est comme ça
Et la marseillaise, qui ne la connaît pas?

Le charme français, du Nord en Provence
Oui, c'est l'accordéon sur lequel on danse
C'est une rengaine dans un couloir de métro
Le charme français, c'est pas l'Amérique
Ce serait plutôt du genre nostalgique
C'est un muscadet dans un coin de bistrot

Quand tu dan-anses
Ton foulard c’est mon drapeau
Les rocke-ers, les flippe-ers
Tombent en panne aussitôt-ôt
Quand tu dan-anses
Tu mériterais d’avoir une contravention-on
Si c’était-ait moi le juge
Mon lit ça serait ta prison-on

Oh quand tu dan-anses
Je vois bien
Venir le temps de la décaden-ence
Le streap-tea-ease, les seins nu-us
Ça m’impressionne plus quand tu remues les hanches

Quand tu dan-anses
Le pepsi c’est du champagne
Les sunli-ights, les guita-ares
Ça n’a pas vraiment d’importan-ance
Quand tu dan-anses
Les juk-bo-oxes jouent le rock’n roll à l’enve-ers
Le pasteu-eur, les bigottes
Voudraient bien te voir en enfe-er

Quand tu danses
Hollywood c’est du mélo
Je bénis celui qui

C. Kenneth Lee,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray 
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk 
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

Want to feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Faraway
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolvin' doors
Maybe I don't know where they take me
But gotta keep movin' on
Movin' on
Fly away
Breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

C. Lanzbom,"World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts fallin' down
Better change your tune
Yeah, you reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky
Baby, just spread your wings
We'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind
Run, run, run away
Like a train runnin' off the track
Got the truth bein' left behind
Falls between the cracks
Standin' on broken dreams
Never losin' sight, ah
Well just spread your wings
We'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind
So baby dry your eyes
Save all the tears you've cried

'Cause we belong in a world that must be strong

C. Lanzbom,"If I was a bird, I could take to the sky, I'd just have to open my wings
It feels like I'm flying when I look in Your eyes
And it's all because of the love that You bring
I've spent most of my life, stuck on the ground
But You lift me up so high, ooh, just look at me now

I'm free, You make me feel so free
I never thought I could feel so much love
Your the only one, the only one for me
You make me feel so free

If I was a ship I could sail away out on endless oceans of blue
And the touch of Your hand is the light of my day
And the gentle breeze I know that's You
I've spent most of my life tied to the shore
But You know You cut the tides and with You life is so much more

I'm free, You make me feel so free
I never thought I could feel so much love
Your the only one, the only one for me
You make me feel so free

I believe that the greatest gift, of loving somebody is
To feel the wind rushing through your heart
You fly me so high, when I'm here in Your arms

I'm free, You make me feel so free
I never thought I could feel so much love
Your the only one, the only one for me
You make me feel so free, free, free, free

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon

'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name 
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me

Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

C. Shirvell,"Me and my baby, my baby and me
We're 'bout as happy as babies can be
What if I find that I'm caught in a storm?
I don't care my baby's there
And baby's bound to keep me warm

We're sticking together and ain't we got fun
So much together you'd count us as one
Tell old man worry to go climb a tree
'Cause I'm with my baby, I've got my baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
A dream of a duo now don't you agree
Why keep it mum when there's nothing to hide?
And what I feel I must reveal
It's more that I can keep inside

And I can assure you it won't go away
Let me assure you it grows every day
I was a one once but now I'm a we
'Cause I got my baby, dear little baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
Facing the world optimistically
Nothing can stop us so nobody try
'Cause baby's rough and full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I

Get out of our way, folks and give us some room
Watch how we bubble and blossom and bloom
Life was a prison but we got the key
Me and my baby, me and my baby
Dear little baby, cute little baby
Look at my baby and me

",Me and My Baby,1998
C. Shirvell,"If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him

If someone in the movie show
Yelled, ""Fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg""
You'd notice him

And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then
Unless, of course, that person it should be
Invisible, inconsequential me

Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya, Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man for seven years
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human being next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who

Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there

Debí correr lejos de ahí

And meet the young lady who fell from a star.
She fell from the sky,
She fell very far and Kansas she says is the name of the star.
Kansas she say is the name of the star.
She brings you good news or haven't  you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle, what happened was just this.
The wind began to switch, the house to pitch, and suddenly the hinges started 
to unhitch.
Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing 
for a hitch.
And oh what happen'd was rich.
The house began to pitch,the kitchen took a slitch,it landed on the wicked 
witch in the middle of a ditch.
Which was not a healthy situation for a wicked witch.

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

C.C.C.P.,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,1999

Holdin' on to Your hand though sometimes I don't understand
Tears I cried night and day, but I'm gonna trust you anyway
Because You love me and I love you too.

Been in church all my life
Sometimes all I find is strife
Thought I'd have friends to the end
Sometimes alone is all I've been
Tears I cried night and day
But God has always made a way
Because He loves and I love Him too

I love you so and I'm never gonna let you go
Holdin' on to Your hand though sometimes I don't understand
Tears I cried night and day, but I'm gonna trust you anyway
Because You love me and I love you too.

Left my home, family and job
And my life was so very hard
Tried my best to stand the test
Then God came and gave me rest
Tears I cried night and day

I love you so and I'm never gonna let you go
Holdin' on to Your hand though sometimes I don't understand
Tears I cried night and day, but I'm gonna trust you anyway
Because You love me and I love you too.

I lost my job after 14 years
It left me living in fear
I didn't know how to pay my bills

C.D. Hawkins,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

C.I.,"{C.I.}
Yeah, ha (B.K.) C.I. (okay?)
Yo

You ever rolled up in a convenience store with a forty-four
and told the cashier to drop to the floor?
But you didn't take anything but a bag of chips
a half gallon of milk, some juice, and a box of grits?

{Bubba}
Nah but I might walk up in Kroger, head straight for the DVD's
Stuff 'bout four of 'em in my cargo, smile and flee with ease
Then hit up the Super Target, exchange 'em for store credit
That's sixty dollars worth of grub, some squares and a case of Bud

{C.I.}
Yo.. yo you ever invested your money in some internet stock?
Seen how your cheese multiply quicker than sellin rocks?

{Bubba}
I invest in pharmaceuticals like Xanax and Loritabs
Take 'em all with alcohol, then hunt for some more to grab

{C.I.}
Yo.. you ever had a chick with no brains, but liked to give 'em
that had the nerve to ask you to scream her name while you hit it?

{Bubba}
Haha.. nah but I know this Betty who licks ass for her enjoyment
She also takes golden showers and drinks the piss from out my toilet
And when it's time for the deployment of doo-doo from out my anus
She likes to catch it in her hands and lick the excess from her fingers

{C.I.}
Yo, you ever tried to purchase a car with a personal check?
Have your lady call you a dog, and send you to the vet?
Ever been in trouble with the cops, for more than three times
from tryin to sell digital video cameras to the blind?

{Bubba}
Mannnn fuck purchasin a car, I live on ""New Jersey Drive""
Athens Georgia, three-oh-six-oh-five, that ain't no lie
And my girl don't even speak cause I get violent when I drink
But it's perfect cause she don't talk, I need some silence when I think
about the thirty-three times the law tangled me up
With chunky tray, legs up, stuck, thinkin we fuck
Well screw 'em they ain't enough to stop these Sparxxx from flyin
If Bubba ain't the truth that just mean that my heart is lyin

{Chorus: repeat 2X}
No matter what you ask me, I'm givin you Bubba Kay
Just the truth of the matter okay? Fuck what you say
Nuttin more nuttin less, I'ma get it off my chest
C.I., spit what I feel, regardless

{Bubba}
Would you rather move two thousand units and be critically acclaimed
or sell two million out the gate and be labelled lyrically lame?
In other words, would you prefer to have dem mics in The Source
or a Grammy, some jazzy broads, a little ice and a Porsche?

{C.I.}
I ain't gon' lie, I'm tryin to sell three million out the gate (okay)
And get six mics in The Source off of lyrical force
And push a custom made Porsche and a Range with the woodgrain
And spit verses sharp enough to cut straight to your brain

{Bubba}
Well, you ever fucked a chunky broad, weighin three hundred plus up
and actually took some pride to the shit, and didn't rush none?

{C.I.}
Yo.. when it comes to big chicks, C.I. plead the fifth
Cause I only weigh a buck-fifty and I don't own a forklift

{Bubba}
Man have you ever snorted coke 'til your heart sat in your throat
then took your whole advance to buy more, and woke up broke?

{C.I.}
Yo.. C.I. don't do drugs, I hang out with corporate thugs
that transport microchips and oriental rugs
Then sell 'em on the streets for as much as they can
The only Coke I mess with comes in sixteen ounce cans

{Bubba}
But would ever consider dancin with the devil for paper?
Fly with me and Fred Durst on an embezzlement caper?
Would you bet on the Lakers if Jordan played for the Clippers
or leave yo' girl and move to Vegas with a STABLE of strippers?

{C.I.}
Yo.. I wouldn't dance with the devil, the stocks are too hot
And if Jordan played for the Clippers I'd claim Cali like 'Pac
And I'm not into embezzlement, I like hostile takeovers
Corporate jets, BMW's and Range Rovers
cause they're tax writeoffs, they're all business expenses
And as far as that stripper, yo I let my man hit her (man c'mon)
see to the I, Central Intelligence
And if I did touch her believe me you wouldn't find a trace of evidence

{Chorus - repeat 2X}

{Bubba Sparxxx}
Yeah (C.I., and Bubba Sparxx, nonsense)
I think in conclusion, it could be said
That no matter where the fuck I'm at
No matter who the fuck I'm around
I'ma do what the fuck +I+ do
Ride walk leave it or love it I don't give a fuck
Now I fucks with a motherfucker like C.I.
'til we both bleed 'til we can't bleed no more
just cause I know he'll do that same type of shit

Don't forget about the motherfuckin South

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Escalated '99 edition get that 

And what you ain't equal to a shwang and I ain't with that 

Not impressed by all of this is mine but we can split that

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye

But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry

C.J. Mac,"Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body",Big Pimpin',1999
C.J. Ramone,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy -- my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve""

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away
(Dead Man's Curve) I can hear 'em say
""Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve""

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine!

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were - at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve...  )

""Well, the last thing I remember, Doc
I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right""

Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

C.L. Smooth,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

Aiding and abetting the foul 
Is a violation 
That's why my retaliation 
Is premeditation 
The invitation 
Is to run with a crew you can't do 
And too great to infiltrate from a 
Nickel plate 
I state 
This be the illest ever known on a rush 
Swervin' with the Krush 

Slip into the world of shiesty individuals

To chaos and mayhem 
Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them

Was in the back of the cab the other day
Swear to God I saw you walking passed the other way
My heart rushed, my face flushed
Tell the driver hit the breaks slow the pace up
Wait up, It wasn't you
Realized it's a mirage I was running to

Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

Oh my God",Reminisce 03',2003
C.L. Smooth,"I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one’s a girl, let’s name her pam
Same father as the first but you don’t give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won’t down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma’s gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen’s risin' a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn’t bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I’m clocking pop’s liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that’s where you’re wrong
But give the man a taste and he’s gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don’t wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he’s taking over
I said pop maybe when you’re older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet?
In front of big lou’s, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc’s the greatest better yet the latest
If we’re talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live ’cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that’s word is bond
I’m not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another

C.L. Smooth,"It`s time to dip dive dip
You might break a hip
To the sound that`s legit
I`ve come to make a hit

I usually bust scratches with my man, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide
You`re going on a ride
I know the weather`s nice

There`s no need to play the outside
Guess who`s on the flyer
The man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire

Beats are rough and rugged
Pete Rock is the creator
Now I`m busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada

Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up
I save this subject for later
But, it`s time to catch wreck with the creator

I`m addicted like a stoag
Not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there`s a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold `cause I`m busy kickin` rhymes to the rhythm

Fortified with soul `cause that`s what I give `em
Honeys form a line form a line `cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture
Rhymes made of rapture

Far from illiterate
Always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this
Don`t even consider it

Skins when I want `em
But, only when I eat `em
To set the record straight, I`ll be damned if eat `em
Call me Pete Rock

I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow
Because you know I`m good to go

As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator
Just a crowd motivator
But, it`s time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I`m`a take a try
And get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec
To get some wreck

Never filled with anger
A good body banger
If you try to step to this you`ll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye

Suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can`t see this
My word is beneficial
Pete Rock is the issue

And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch
(Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse

(No question)
Either one, I can`t be seen
Honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around

I`ll show you what I mean
Not an imitator
Just a crowd motivator
But, it`s time to get wreck with the creator

It`s time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

First of all, you better count your blessings
When you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids

In peace, in war, let's take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief

It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air

That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy

This run is for the green jacket, I fit the masters
My crew havin' business, save, put it in through my office
The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous

That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals and told me the truth

Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith

Hard work payin' of and them wishes comin' true
Bolt open and you out to lunch and left us two

Why my uncle doc left me everything when he died
And when pop passed, two weeks later I cried
And when great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby

Can't talk bad about me, she tell 'em why we need to give her
All those roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we was
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her

Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind

Escapism, Return Of The Mecca, Straighten It Out, The Creators
Yeah, right about now we about to make history

The track make you nod like smack through the needle
Niggas don't sell crack 'cause they evil
America's build on the backs of my people
Cats say they packin' the heat but they actin' like Chino
'Cause when it's time to bounce it back they fall back in the fetal
I went from crashin' the beat in the passenger seat
Drivin' like many straight trees don't even mix Coke with the Henney
Flow with so many styles ladies open all night like Denys
24 hours party people soakin' in the Remy and Cris'
The video is directed by Benny and Chris
Treat a pager like a website with plenty of hits
I tell 'em this, you gotta be at least a dime for a piece of mind
I deal with quarters and keys just like a leachious mind
I like mature girls just now reachin' they prime
Know how to conversate to the man and don't eat no swine

A nigga so cold he hot

They should Straighten It Out on a Pete Rock track like C.L. Smooth
See we livin' in the Matrix way before the movie
Kids fiendin' 'ore the camera screaming, just shoot me
We 93 million miles away from the sun
But you still feel the heat when we practice the way of the gun
Like Taye Diggs raise kids to escape the slave ships
Instead they wanna pump weights not the state
Better exercise take from work the rest get left inside
And whips chicks and kicks money we specialize
I be the respirator so hip hop is kept alive
So many niggas buggin' me I need a fuckin' pesticide

You put light back to life 'cause these rappers ain't actin' right
Thinkin' they cut like Mack the knife, you have to fight
Battle right through the afterlife
'Cause when you die make you look way past the light
And hind sight I drop the type of rhyme
To give the blind sight, sparkle a shine bright like lemon lime
Sprite up in the limelight, yeah
As we still at the track you feel it when the chorus tack
You deal it twist a cap back with a skillet official would kill it
This is fake the way we seal it as the great Pete Rock and Kweli
Got heat to make your chicks knees knock to Pete Rock my life
It's the soundtrack other niggas sound wack
Like white kids tryin' to sound black
I spit on mics wet up the essence where L drowned at
This Guerilla Monsoon Rap first comb rap
Soon rap come through a crossroads, and all these lost souls
Will send out distress signals like Morse code

Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it`s loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it

It`s kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won`t hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who`s the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she`ll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won`t be the Post
After that you know the flavor I`m ghost!

Hit it off.. on the skinz

Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they`re forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
but never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won`t curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I`m with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder

Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I`m out

Like the Isley`s, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it`s OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

Yeah, ha (B.K.) C.I. (okay?)
Yo

You ever rolled up in a convenience store with a forty-four
and told the cashier to drop to the floor?
But you didn't take anything but a bag of chips
a half gallon of milk, some juice, and a box of grits?

{Bubba}
Nah but I might walk up in Kroger, head straight for the DVD's
Stuff 'bout four of 'em in my cargo, smile and flee with ease
Then hit up the Super Target, exchange 'em for store credit
That's sixty dollars worth of grub, some squares and a case of Bud

{C.I.}
Yo.. yo you ever invested your money in some internet stock?
Seen how your cheese multiply quicker than sellin rocks?

{Bubba}
I invest in pharmaceuticals like Xanax and Loritabs
Take 'em all with alcohol, then hunt for some more to grab

{C.I.}
Yo.. you ever had a chick with no brains, but liked to give 'em
that had the nerve to ask you to scream her name while you hit it?

{Bubba}
Haha.. nah but I know this Betty who licks ass for her enjoyment
She also takes golden showers and drinks the piss from out my toilet
And when it's time for the deployment of doo-doo from out my anus
She likes to catch it in her hands and lick the excess from her fingers

{C.I.}
Yo, you ever tried to purchase a car with a personal check?
Have your lady call you a dog, and send you to the vet?
Ever been in trouble with the cops, for more than three times
from tryin to sell digital video cameras to the blind?

{Bubba}
Mannnn fuck purchasin a car, I live on ""New Jersey Drive""
Athens Georgia, three-oh-six-oh-five, that ain't no lie
And my girl don't even speak cause I get violent when I drink
But it's perfect cause she don't talk, I need some silence when I think
about the thirty-three times the law tangled me up
With chunky tray, legs up, stuck, thinkin we fuck
Well screw 'em they ain't enough to stop these Sparxxx from flyin
If Bubba ain't the truth that just mean that my heart is lyin

{Chorus: repeat 2X}
No matter what you ask me, I'm givin you Bubba Kay
Just the truth of the matter okay? Fuck what you say
Nuttin more nuttin less, I'ma get it off my chest
C.I., spit what I feel, regardless

{Bubba}
Would you rather move two thousand units and be critically acclaimed
or sell two million out the gate and be labelled lyrically lame?
In other words, would you prefer to have dem mics in The Source
or a Grammy, some jazzy broads, a little ice and a Porsche?

{C.I.}
I ain't gon' lie, I'm tryin to sell three million out the gate (okay)
And get six mics in The Source off of lyrical force
And push a custom made Porsche and a Range with the woodgrain
And spit verses sharp enough to cut straight to your brain

{Bubba}
Well, you ever fucked a chunky broad, weighin three hundred plus up
and actually took some pride to the shit, and didn't rush none?

{C.I.}
Yo.. when it comes to big chicks, C.I. plead the fifth
Cause I only weigh a buck-fifty and I don't own a forklift

{Bubba}
Man have you ever snorted coke 'til your heart sat in your throat
then took your whole advance to buy more, and woke up broke?

{C.I.}
Yo.. C.I. don't do drugs, I hang out with corporate thugs
that transport microchips and oriental rugs
Then sell 'em on the streets for as much as they can
The only Coke I mess with comes in sixteen ounce cans

{Bubba}
But would ever consider dancin with the devil for paper?
Fly with me and Fred Durst on an embezzlement caper?
Would you bet on the Lakers if Jordan played for the Clippers
or leave yo' girl and move to Vegas with a STABLE of strippers?

{C.I.}
Yo.. I wouldn't dance with the devil, the stocks are too hot
And if Jordan played for the Clippers I'd claim Cali like 'Pac
And I'm not into embezzlement, I like hostile takeovers
Corporate jets, BMW's and Range Rovers

C.W. McCall,"(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)

One night last summer we were camped at ten thousand feet up where the air is clear, high in the Rockies of Lost Lake, Colorado. And as the fire burned low and only a few glowing embers remained, we laid on our backs all warm in our sleeping bags and looked up at the stars.

And as I felt myself falling into the vastness of the Universe, I thought about things, and places, and times.

I thought about the time my grandma told me what to say when I saw the evening star. You know, Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.

The air is crystal-clear up here; that's why you can see a million stars.

I remember a time a bunch of us were in a canyon of the Green River in Wyoming; it was a night like this. And we had our rafts pulled up on the bank an' turned over so we could sleep on 'em, and one of the guys from New York said, ""Hey! Look at the smog in the sky! Smog clear out here in the sticks!"" And somebody said, ""Hey, Joe, that's not smog; that's the Milky Way.""

Joe had never seen the Milky Way.

And we saw the Northern Lights once, in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. They're like flames from some prehistoric campfire, leaping and dancing in the sky and changing colors. Red to gold, and blue to violet... Aurora Borealis. It's like the equinox, the changing of the seasons. Summer to fall, young to old, then to now. And then tomorrow...

And then everyone was asleep, except me. And as I saw the morning star come up over the mountains, I realized that life is just a collection of memories. And memories are like starlight: they go on forever.

C.W. McCall,"(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)

Bill Fries says that this is based on a true story from the late '60s, when a band of hippies rolled into Telluride and decided to stay.

One day about four or five years ago
We is settin' at the Conoco station
Kickin' tires, and swattin' flies,
And discussin' the State of the Union
When right out in front of the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
And thirty-five hippies and dogs inside
About half of 'em went for the courthouse lawn
And them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
And I says, ""Roy, go get your Flit gun""
He says, ""Which is the hippies? And which is the dogs?""
I says, ""Beats the hell outta me, Roy.""
What they was, was a bunch a' them Crispy Critters
And their leader was a space cadet

He says, ""Sagittarius, we has arrived.
""Prepare to disembark, men.
""Get the incense goin' and the sitar out
""We gonna camp in the city park, man.""

I says, ""Boys, let me explain the situation to ya.
""A: you're gettin' me down
""And B: we got us a leash law here
""And C: you in the wrong town.
""You drop one string a' beads in that there park
""And you gonna see a whole lotta stars.
""You got fifteen seconds to get out of town, boys,
""Or we gonna blow ya ta Mars.""

Well, they all got back in the purple bus
And proceeded to the city limits.
Then the telephone rang, was the swimmin' pool
Says a mess a' wild Critters was in it!
So we all got in the Marshal's Plymouth
(Which is always at the Conoco station)
Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool
To give them Critters a citation

By the time we arrived, it was too damn late
Them critters is all had their pants down
Them dogs was tearin' the bathhouse apart,
And they's after the fish in the fish pond!
I says, ""Roy, you get the one in the silver T-shirt
""And I'll get the rest with a net.
""We gonna have a jail full a' naked Crispy Critters
""And a drip-dry space cadet.""

[You've watched The Dukes of Hazzard, haven't you? c'mon, admit it; nobody's looking. Well, at this point in the song there's a short interlude which resembles a car chase on Dukes. There's banjo pickin' and yee-hawin' and a general sense of raucous abandon. Oh, yeah, and a few dog barks. It's round-up time at the swimmin' pool.]

Well, we gave 'em hell, but we lost the war
'Cause them Critters outnumbered us
So they moved in and set up camp
And they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later, there was nothin' in town
But eighty-four dogs and a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds, and sunflower seeds,
And astrological postcards

Yeah, Critters took over the City Council
And the dogs all barked their brains out
And the whole damn town was Crispy Critters
And the mayor was a space cadet

It's gonna be a long road with twists and turns, lessons learnt, bridges burnt
I guess it's just the way it goes ahh yeah

Ain't crazy ain't strange
How our lifes are rearranged
Things will never be the same again no

Deep down can you hear what I'm saying
I found that there's another way(ing)
Right now can you hear what I'm saying
Deep down deep down
Deep down there's a word that describes it
Somehow I guess I'll never find it
Deep down deep down

Hurt you that way

Maybe, you hesitate
Twice shy, that's why your waiting
Maybe, I set my hopes to high
But all I want to, do now
Is hold you close

Its lovely day why hide away
Forget the ceel phone and just let it ring
Pull the curtain and see what it brings

Make it by trying
Don't hold back just get it on and on

One cup too many of coffee you'll see
You think your hosting on mtv
Is that your way of letting go
Then you'll better stop the show

Take your hand out of your pocket
And show them what you got

You are learning by living
Paraglide the winds of change
Make it by trying
Don't hold back just get it on and on

You'll better get a ticket
To get a seat on next flight

We're ready to take part
But now further direction is required
Tonight a battle has been join

Regrettably, we know believe that only force will make them live.

That regardless of what they say about it
There's nothing new, only different!
Never forget this, the future is to those who take it
All I say is that noting is easy, and the best things are the hardest.

Came over, she pulled my dick out, then she started blowing it kisses
Sprayed it all over her face, now the bitch watching my children

Far away from night-clubs and from saxophones
He said, ""Yo ho, I've made a certain port
And when you talk about real He-Man sport""

Hot ginger and dynamite
There's nothing but that at night back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

The way they can entertain
Would hurry a hurricane back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

In Fujiama you get a mama
Then your troubles increase
In some pagoda, she orders soda
Earth shake, milk shakes, ten cents a piece

They kissy and huggy nice
Oh, by jingo, it's worth the price back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

Now when the day is warm
You can keep in form
With a bowl of rice beneath a parasol
Every gentle man has to use a fan

And they only use suspenders in the fall
That's where the girls don't think of rings and furs
Gosh, it's the nicest place that ever weres

They give you a carriage free
The horse is a Japanee back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

They sit you upon the floor
No wonder your pants get sore back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

With sweet Kimoner, I pulled a boner
I kept it up at high speed
I got rheumatics and then psyatics
Halatosisis, that's guaranteed

You just have to act your age
Or wind up inside a cage back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

With an ice-cream cone and a bottle of tea
You can rest all day by the hickory tree
But when night comes round, oh gosh, oh gee
Mother, Mother, Mother, pin a rose on me

Those pretty mamas in pink pajamas
They try to give you a kiss, those torrid teases
In B.V.D.ses
Heaven help a sailor on a night like this

Not too gentle and not too rough
But you've got to tell them when you've had enough
Back in Nagasaki where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

And not from blow and gates
They've got a new type menace up there

He just blew into town
He's slim and coffee-brown
His trademark is a call that fills the air

But Harlemites don't take alarm
He really doesn't mean you harm
He's only loaded-up with jungle charm

No trees about
But listen to his shout, whooooa

He's the Tarzan of Harlem (he's the Tarzan of Harlem)
Big gals and small
All answer to his call, whooooa

He's the Tarzan of Harlem (he's the Tarzan of Harlem)
Instead of swingin' from the trees
He swings 'round the old Savoy
Romancin' all those chickadees
With a ""hey"" and a ""floy-floy-floy!""

He kills them with a kiss
And if some nights you hear a road
And someone's breaking down the door
That's just the way to ask for more, whooooa

Why not leave trouble behind?

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

Cab Calloway,"It was up at Mike's the other night,
There was really quite a sight,
Gather round, folks, while I give you all the lowdown.
Tables were filled with bloody frails,

Chewing on their fingernails;
They were waiting for the man from Harlem.
Drinks were served six bits a throw,
Things were moving kind of slow,

Everybody's nerves were getting jumpy.
All at once the room was still,
Men forgot all about their bill,
Who should enter but the man from Harlem.

Everybody rolled their eyes,
Women starting heaving sighs,
Someone hollered, Music, lights and gin,
Everybody cleared a space,

They had big, broad smiles on every face,
How they all loved to see the man from Harlem.
When he started in to step
He filled everyone with plenty pep,

He twitched and squirmed; it just was a dirty shame.
Everyone was in a daze,
Women watched him with amaze,
Each one said she'd have the man from Harlem.

He looked over in the corner,
And saw a couple of frails
And they sure did look kinda low.
Another cat walked up, and said to the man from Harlem,

Go over there and see what's the matter with them girls.
And they said, I'm kinda low.
And he said, I've got just what you need:
Come on, sisters, light up on these weeds and get high
And forget about everything",The Man from Harlem,1998
Cab Calloway,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1999
Cab Calloway,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

Well, here's a dance that you all should do:
You get 'way low down to the floor,

You peck to the front, to the sides, to the back,
Well, look at old Jim, he's pecking on his back!
Peckin' to me is a lot of fun,
Well, you peck one, and I'll peck one, well, we'll all peck one!

It's the dance we all should do,
In the place of the Suzy-Q;
Well, come on folks, lend me your ears awhile,
And I'll guarantee you, your little tootsie-wootsies will sure run wild.

You peck to the east, and then you peck to the west,

You're the cure for what ails me, and you do me good!

Down with the ultraviolet ray,
You're the cure for what ails me, and you do me good!

You can go starve a fever,
You can feed a cold,
But I don't fear fever and I can't get cold,

Cab Calloway,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2000

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

There was really quite a sight,
Gather round, folks, while I give you all the lowdown.
Tables were filled with bloody frails,
Chewing on their fingernails;
They were waiting for the man from Harlem.
Drinks were served six bits a throw,
Things were moving kind of slow,
Everybody's nerves were getting jumpy.
All at once the room was still,
Men forgot all about their bill,
Who should enter but the man from Harlem.
Everybody rolled their eyes,
Women starting heaving sighs,
Someone hollered, Music, lights and gin,
Everybody cleared a space,
They had big, broad smiles on every face,
How they all loved to see the man from Harlem.
When he started in to step
He filled everyone with plenty pep,
He twitched and squirmed; it just was a dirty shame.
Everyone was in a daze,
Women watched him with amaze,
Each one said she'd have the man from Harlem.
He looked over in the corner,
And saw a couple of frails
And they sure did look kinda low.
Another cat walked up, and said to the man from Harlem,
Go over there and see what's the matter with them girls.
And they said, I'm kinda low.
And he said, I've got just what you need:
Come on, sisters, light up on these weeds and get high

Once he had the blues so he took a cruise

Far away from night-clubs and from saxophones
He said, ""Yo ho, I've made a certain port
And when you talk about real He-Man sport""

Hot ginger and dynamite
There's nothing but that at night back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

The way they can entertain
Would hurry a hurricane back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

In Fujiama you get a mama
Then your troubles increase
In some pagoda, she orders soda
Earth shake, milk shakes, ten cents a piece

They kissy and huggy nice
Oh, by jingo, it's worth the price back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

Now when the day is warm
You can keep in form
With a bowl of rice beneath a parasol
Every gentle man has to use a fan

And they only use suspenders in the fall
That's where the girls don't think of rings and furs
Gosh, it's the nicest place that ever weres

They give you a carriage free
The horse is a Japanee back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

They sit you upon the floor
No wonder your pants get sore back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

With sweet Kimoner, I pulled a boner
I kept it up at high speed
I got rheumatics and then psyatics
Halatosisis, that's guaranteed

You just have to act your age
Or wind up inside a cage back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

With an ice-cream cone and a bottle of tea
You can rest all day by the hickory tree
But when night comes round, oh gosh, oh gee
Mother, Mother, Mother, pin a rose on me

Those pretty mamas in pink pajamas
They try to give you a kiss, those torrid teases
In B.V.D.ses
Heaven help a sailor on a night like this

Not too gentle and not too rough
But you've got to tell them when you've had enough
Back in Nagasaki where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

That's the one and only place to travel to;
Music in the air,
Dancing everywhere,
That's Harlem hospitality!

When you hear a welcome to your song,
You'll keep shoutin' hallelujah all night long;
You never rest
When you get the best
Of Harlem hospitality!

It's a waste of life until you hear a song and love it,
You just, ""Yeah, man!""
It's a taste of life to shim-sham-shimmy with the ""Black and Tan.""

You don't need to eat an apple every day,
Hi-de-ho will keep the doctor far away,
You can't get ill
When you get the thrill
Of Harlem hospitality!

E eu não tô de coleira
Tô fazendo o meu com muito suor

Este rollo no detendran, rap ataca sin piedad

Como una maquina real dinamica
Rieles transportando alma informatica
No hay estatica materia organica
Unos haciendo y llevando melodia romantica

Toma el micro y pon tu voz al ritmo
No importa no habra ridiculos
Dibujarte una sonrisa es un estimulo
Parpados caidos 4 am trabajo continuo

Mi crew pone su nombre
Año 9-7 en Gómez
Solo es pulir mi sonido y burlar tus horizontes
Es r-a-p el ritmo tener

El luchar por un genero y lo echan a perder
El vivir al 100
Y cada quien a lo suyo
Enfocar mi vida por un camino mas seguro

Caballero que cabalga
Sobre un ritmo y sin espada
Vivo el dia a dia y ver el sol salir mañana

Y si no esta
Brindare por la luna
Buscare lo mio
Y nada importa

Si no esta buscare
Hasta encontrar
Si no se atraviesa
Algun otro bar

No me importa, que si tengo estilo
No me importa, si soy el mismo tipo
No me importa, mis habitos distintos
No me importa, me sigo en el camino

Algun disco vendido, salir de lios
Pelear con tipos, dormir en el piso
Es vivir hip hop 24/7

Ser yo y no aparentar lo que no se tiene
Me agrada eso de jugar chueco a la vida
Y con rap conectar del estudio a tu esquina
No me importa tu discurso de real

Caballo Dorado,"Cuando el diablo bajo a Georgia buscando un alma que robarse ahí 
Llego el de prisa como la brisa, a lo mejor un trato yo hago aquí, un 
Violín escucho a lo lejos la nota se puso a seguir, encontrando a un 
Chico tocando le dijo ¿Sabes lo que hago aquí?, yo creo que tu no 
Sabes pero también toco el violín, si quieres jugamos a algo, yo 
Soy el amo y estoy aquí, tocas bien muchacho, el diablo dice es
Mejor que tu, te apuesta su violín de oro contra tu alma y tu sangre 
Azul, el chico dice yo soy Jonhi y jamás pecare, y me da pena 
Decirte acepto el reto yo lo haré 

Jonhi piensa como hacer para al diablo ganar, el día menos 
Pensado los dos se batirán violín de oro y alma en juego cartas del 
Terror, Jonhi sabes que tú eres el mejor 

El diablo abrió su estuche y dijo yo empiezo este Show, había 
Fuego en sus manos distintas eran daban terror, tocando a dúo con 
Las cuerdas sonó el infierno como es y una banda de demonios 
Aparecieron junto a el 

Terminaste Diablo y ahora yo te dedico esta canción, boy a 
Enseñarte un poco de lo que siente mi corazón 

Fíjense muchachos que el ya aprendió, fuego en la montaña sigue 
La función, el Diablo esta en la casa donde el asenso, tiene que 
Saber que el Diablo ya perdió 

El Diablo inmediatamente se los platico como fue bajo la cabeza y 
Dijo caray Jonhi tocas bien, le entregaba el violín de oro cuando
Jonhi contesto, aquí te espero demonio maldito siempre te ganare yo

singles bars and good time lovers were never true.
Playin' a fools game hopin' to win; 
and tellin' those sweet lies  and losin' again.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
And I was alone then, no love in sight;
and I did ev'rything I could to get me though the night.

I turned to a stranger just like a friend.

But I got to keep rollin'.

He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind,
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said,
""Boy let me tell you what:
I guess you didn´t know it, but I'm a fiddle player too,
And if you'd care to take a dare,
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle,
Boy, but give the Devil his due
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret,
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard,
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you lose, the Devil gets your soul!

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire blew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in,
And it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished, Johnny said,
""Well you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done!""

And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny´s feet

I'm the best there´s ever been""

Songs that are spun of gold

Somewhere in her own little head
Someday all too soon
She'll grow up and she'll leave her dolls

no descubrir aun el final de los dos
voy sin direccion
buscando mas prohibidos juegos de amor
y dolor y dolor.

fue clemente el juez 
solo el tiempo es mi condena
y ahora bagare de la mano de cualquier alma en pena

Y tu la negra flor
de mi jardin veneno dulce y mortal
Mujer sueño real
no pienses mal si ya no estoy por aqui
a llamar al portal

Y ahora vivo aqui 
donde cruza la frontera
entre la razón 
y una inutil ilusion traicionera

Cabaret Voltaire,"You mesmerize slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right

But I still feed the flame

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil

Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance

A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in

But I still feed the flame

You know I want your touch of evil

Cabaret Voltaire,"Come into a dusty room.
Sitting down with empty papers.
Wipe your smoke through the hallways.
Someone whispers in the darkness.

All alone in this new light.
This isn't love in wartime.
Blue, blue, strip you blue.

Blue, blue, strip you blue.
This star, like a die is cast.
Nice talking, under wraps.
Tracing their every movement.

Seducing me in wartime.
Scatter the dusty papers.
But it's late, the time clicks over.
I am, still moving.

I feel, her voice is nearer.
With me, I'm part of you.
Return, to these rooms.
Come back to, blue heaven.

Pasa la noche conmigo bonita
O múdate cerca
Y asi me visitas

That worked in the mines and the mills

Built their homes in the hills.

la pena de un amor que ya no está.

Cacho Castaña,"Mensajero de emociones
Traigo un beso en mis solapas desteñidas
De una novia que esta ausente
Porque no le di mi vida
Y parado en las esquinas me quedé

Soy un tango
Vengo del barrio del bacán y de la mina
Y del dramón de aquella pálida vecina
Que quizás nunca a su vida
Llegue el tren

Mensajero
De un Buenos Aires con bastón y con sombrero
De un obelisco compadrón y aventurero
Que siempre espera que le cuelguen
Un farol

Habitante silencioso
Polizonte de algún libro de poemas
Voy del brazo del alcohol y de la pena
Y algún fuelle me condena
Porque sabe más que yo

Soy un tango
Duermo en la cama que me prestan los poetas
Y a veces sueño con un director de orquesta
Que me acompaña en soledad
Y no me quiero despertar

Cachorro López,"Sé que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar
Que estas cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar girando siempre en un lugar

Sé que las ventanas se pueden abrir
Cambiar el aire depende de ti
Te ayudara vale la pena una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Es mejor perderse que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar

Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así­ será la vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Cactus,"I was born in seventy-one
In seventy-two I started to walk
Seventy-three
Seventy-four

Seventy-five
I learned to talk
Seventy-six I tried sexing
That was around the age of five

Seventy-seven
Seventy-eight
And seventy-nine
I started to ride

With my
Uncle Ike
In eighty and eighty-one
I was about ten

But the first time a little chick
Made me cum
Was eighty-two
Or eighty-three

My life really came alive
In eighty-four
I was thirteen
But

Nineteen eighty-five's
The number
I met this bitch
Who told me if I got tight with her

Together we would grow rich
Type of chick
That'll make a brother
Feel good inside

In my mind when I'm sleep
Woke
When I walk
When I ride

Getting to me in the classroom
Used to follow me into the bathroom
And I loved it
She was wild

And everyday
People bore me
Captivate
Activate my hormones

When you speak to me
Softly
Offer me
A piece of you

'Cause
Me so horny
She let me foreplay
And that's it

She said
If I would rap
And make some dollars for us
Maybe I can get a hit

I was writing
Then I found myself fighting
For the juices
When I found out

That our little agreement's
Non-exclusive
Ah damn
She let celebrity status hit

So I'm thinking of tactics
How to leave ran down
Prophylatics
On the mattress

So I practice
Hoping to stuff my fat dick
In this rap bitch
Knowing when I stuff my cactus

In that catfish
Imma flat shit
She's turning me into a killer
Devour fools

I'm powerful
Like Mecha-Godzilla
She said
If I keep rapping

She'll keep clapping
But ain't nobody strapping
Till she see paper
And then we'll see what's happening

And I hear her say

You heard of Tech
He's like the best
He built his nest
In the Midwest
The boy can flow
And he be busting like
Boom boom
It's like I'm stuck
I feel I'm cursed
About to load the N9na
Tech cause in a sec
I'm finna be busting like
Boom boom

[2nd Verse]

Ninety-three
She invited me
To a party in L.A.
So popular
She introduced me to
2Pac the next day
She took me to this party
In Beverly Hills
Where me and Chris Tucker
Couldn't get in
Because of our ball caps
And they was all about dollar bills
She was a G
And got us all in for free
Ran into Pac again
She talked about him so tough
I knew she was cocking him
But I never did hate
Because I knew
Heated sex
Was our fate
As I got clever
And a lot better
She started letting me and my boys
Hit together
Me and Pac hit the slot
Now it's out in the open
Didn't take long
To make her get it on
Came on strong
And Thugs Get Lonely too
Was our slogan
She wanted me
And Chino XL
But he backed off
And said that's hell
He don't dip into every female
Waiting to exhale
With a
Wet tail
Wish I could be with baby
Daily
But I recall
The Veteran Click saying
Tech
Don't turn a tramp into your
Lady
I don't know why
I want this bitch
She always dis and
Won't let me
Showcase my shit
This bitch is driving N9na
Crazy

Fuck this

One on one ruckus
Still she like

Me and Roger Troutman
Had you at Juan Momma house
Shouting
Through the talk box
You exhaust cocks
And you ought not
Ever get caught hot
Why she always gotta have the vault lock
Kinda mad when I really
Thought back
Me and Rza hit that ass
On the video set
Why did we hit

Snatch darkness from these hours
Devoid of evening and morning
Devoid of stars and funereal lightnings.
There is a path with no light and no moon

From the poisoned darts.
Modify your mind follow the shapes
From the red seven to the blue one
Mark the sacred space
In the name of wind and sound
Say your solemn prayer to the burning fire
Invoke the grace of water sources and raging oceans
Invite earth's creatures to your dance.
May Rafe lead my soul to victory
He's the master of my turbid game
May his energy bless my hand when I move the pieces
His power protects my secret plan
May his genius hasten the times
His presence secures my triumph.

Daddy never showed me how the heat will hold me down
So now I rob and steal, spit shit you feel, wit a clique that kills
Yea my shit's that real, I hustle hard all my life
Ran the streets all night
My wife always said everything was gonna be aight
And she was right and that's one reason why I love her
But everything she said went in one ear and out the other

When the kids need clothes, what a thug gon do?
Hit the streets and hustle, pick up the heat and bust you

But lately, I've been hittin' cribs
And safes where the cake be

I put that hot shit through you and watch you Holla Holla

I'm a tank running in banks and takin' all of it
Player we're flawless, wit nothin' to lose guns bustin'
And brossen niggas y'all can't live

The other 1/3 spent sittin' on curbs chasin' those birds
If you ever get the urge to come by and try to test
There's only one and then you get numb and lied to rest
It's murder the only code to the ghetto
It's murder, nigga hand me the Bessel
And dance with the devil, guns rapidly spit
Gangsta shit, attractin yo bitch, gettin head and lean back in the whip

Yea 
We about money and murda 
The fuck why'all want to do 
Either pass that paper 
Or we gonna have to kill you 
It's like that nigga 
Don't question why 
'cause when it's murda motherfucker 
Everybody gotta die 
Die motherfucker die 
Die motherfucker die 
Die motherfucker die 
Die motherfucker die 
[Tah Murdah] 
Money ain¡¦t never been nothing 
I hit the block if this shit get ugly 
And it ain¡¦t never been in my heart to let niggas thug me 
Hit the dealer and cop a drop if the eyes is buggy 
And pull up in front of the spot cause the mommies love me 
(It¡¦s gangsta) yeah and ain¡¦t no nigga gone match me 
Stocky, chubby nigga voice real raspy 
I see you real flashy ""but that ain¡¦t gone last nigga"" 
Pop fire off shots ""and that¡¦s your ass nigga"" 
It¡¦s war now that¡¦s why I keep the four with long nozzle 
Six-hundred bad bitch on it holding down the throttle 
And fuck that beef shit cause some beef won¡¦t die 
And some niggas will say they gangsta but they won¡¦t ride 
And while it¡¦s hard for you to decide I¡¦ll let it fly 
Forty shots hit your ride up hit the tropics and hide up 
Under palm tree¡¦s to white sand 
Everything is a price man 
You snipe when bullets are piping hot 
When it¡¦s your flesh it begin warming you 
Now die motherfucker die 
'cause I¡¦m tired of warning you 
[Black Child] 
Yeah we hear now, die motherfucker 
Don¡¦t be scared now, die motherfucker 
Black Child I¡¦m off parole it¡¦s murda now 
In a hood near you about to burn it down 
Word to God it feels like I¡¦m from every hood 
'cause when you ghetto your ghetto with gats you good 
Sell cracks if you could bust your gat when you should 
It¡¦s for my blacks from the bricks back to Inglewood 
We eat together nigga fuck the crossroads 
In this world my flow is another lost soul 
My shit sounds like shots from a four pound 
For these bitch clowns it¡¦s war now 
It¡¦s all about paper that¡¦s my issue 
Fuck peace you can have a piece of the pistol 
[Chorus x2: Ja Rule] 
Everybody gonna die but nobody want dead 
Die motherfucker die, it¡¦s your life 
Everybody want to live, but they want to live scared 
Die motherfucker Die, that¡¦s your life 
[Ja Rule] 
Niggas know the truth 
Rule raises the roof 
'cause I pop more shots than Abdul-Rauf 
And when the concludes I bring closure to the situ 
Come through squeeze eight out the stolen black pinto 
Niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills 
But don¡¦t never slide down it if you to high ground it 
(puff, puff) uhhh! Is how it sounded two shots through and silent 
And one nigga stripped of his talents 
New fucking Yiddy City the sex and violence 
Where first time offenders get floated to the island 
And one time give a nigga one time 
Breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind 
I blow lines like an addict 
Bust guns erratic shine blind like carats 
Rules above average me and this music make a marriage 
So I thee wed till I¡¦m either jailed or dead motherfuckers 
Feel me niggas 
[Black Child] 
Word to God 
Feel us nigga 
We here, again 
It's Murda

And only those who feel me

Especially hoes -n- extasy

We got the murder man that's the spot to chill
Got bitches pop the pill feelin hot for real

Now that's a freaky combination
And freaky conversations 
Lead into freaky situations
Like me tastin your sexuality
Sexy you ever took extasy?
And have you wildin in a club
Smilin at a thug
Express your hugs

Pass the OJ we gettin high tonight, On

[Chorus]
Deutsche Deutsche 
Before i start the Porsche
I keep them pumpin off the Calvin Kleins, Boodo's
And the Nike swoosh
And party saggin like two loose socks
Invest the money in stocks
We gettin the orange juice crops
We ready to get outta hear
Disappear
The bitch get like David Copperfield
When she pop a pill
want to do it in the high heels
On top of a high hill
Cause my nigga ain't tryin to run up then i will
Hit it from behind that's how i polly wit mines
Man we up all night fuckin by the Hollywood sign
Yea got smacked up 
Everytime she backed up
Didn't know there was room in the back
Of the lack truck
I pass her the job then he 
Passed it back

You need a shoe shine job
The way you polish a knob
Backstage panties down eat dick

Still wouldn't matter, push the rock well like Stockton
Paper chasin', chasin' acres
Operation get rich, take money over a bitch
You see me move low in the six and magazines a flicks

Young thuggin' and bossed up
Touch niggas clutchin' what they know they bustin'
We can do whatever nigga, whenever nigga

Really is nothing

Murder INC.'s the underdog
It's a blessin' to ball
We learn a lesson from why'all
How not to fall

Black Child will body a beat, this is airway robbery
When Murder INC. drop albums, that's when gangstas party
What chu know about Ferrari or Cadillac Escalade
Or bitches on Ecstasy, sexy

Eat, sleep, eat and watch freaks eat freaks
Throw it up, put it down for the streets
Who wouldn't fall in love, with a life like this
Hittin' hoes that's priceless

In tight icebergs shit
You can blame the drugs
It ain't gon' change to slugs
A famous thug
Pain is love, mother fuckers!

[Chorus: x 2]

[Ja Rule]
Who would've thought, we get away with manslaughter
Numerous cars, cribs off the water
A playa no longer, life's gettin' shorter
Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders

The Rule don't condone this
Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless
Until blow got on the rise
Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies

But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag
And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag
They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags
Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds

Why-D to O-G, the game chose me
Are-you-L-E the INC. and I-G
We never gon' break free from this life we live as thugs
Pain is love, it's murda

[Chorus: x 2]

You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit
And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-see
You know it's love to thug, cause thug is in our blood
And how we paint this shit, stay on that gangsta shit

You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit
And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-see

Enamorada, de ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Oh

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part

Iin the mornin nigga, Catch you yawnin nigga, It's murda my nigga
Fuck 'em 'cause these bitches got a dream to hear me
Like I got a different stroke, and I'm fucked in pennies
But the reality it hurts more than the truth

And y'all scared I can see it in yo' eyes

I'm supposed to wile
With the toast I'm foul
My Murder Inc. mob money, Oprah style
From here back to the block, they get that green
Known to put a hole through a nigga's shoulder soon as the beam glow
Probably graze you in the face, give me a break
I'ma rapper, out here to stay, don't make me do what I say
Just let me say what I do
Cause I'ma put it in a rhyme, every time, about to spray up your crew
And I ain't lickin' off shots to warn 'em
Just a pop swift to the dome, on the real ""G-Unit"" nigga, glock and all this
So believe I'm not the one when it get stupid in the booth
I told y'all with Rule it was a gun in this bitch
Now I expose how scary you niggas is

Put a nigga dick in the dirt
Lace shots to the face
Hopin' it shut case, John Doe

Okay you hard as fuck
But when the slug hit, you dead if your name ain't armored truck
Murder Inc., Outlawz and the Floys is here
Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, cowboys is near
Stampedin' anythin' in our way, we'll attract war
If your smart you'll slide over like handicap doors
I ain't a killer, I just spark a lot
So when I squeeze I'm turnin' your whole block to a parking lot
Understand I'm the grimy Floy
Wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since '94, that's why cats don't hang around me like Chinese stores
One step ahead of you, get more guys
You strapped with four fours, we pack four fives
Fuck talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if your able to crawl or walk out

I'm in the pop life
So when I pop up in your life, and I pop twice
Get down, I spits more than rounds
And niggas bleed heavier than hoes on they period
This sound gotta movin' ""Faster Than Furious""
But nah I ain't Ludacris
I'm here to let y'all niggas know I ain't new to this
Gun butt your bitch
That's the way I get down, believe my style is Murder
Clap a nigga, dipped and hide the burner
The rule to learn ya bomb ya like embalming fluid
Until your limbs feel a loss of movement
In the hospital in critical livin'
Must minimal (who done it?) it's Murder
Yeah, that's subliminal
Who gets down and bangs with nothin' but criminals (c'mon, c'mon)
Rule nigga you know it, these others cats is pitiful
Bein a rap God is spiritual
Your God is Ja Rule nigga let's not get it confused, haha

Yeah..
Yeah, yeah, yo
I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't s*** to discuss, unless it's moneybags
or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

[Black Child]
Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them
They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them
I aim the stainless, let the games begin
Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous
My hoes don't speak english, catch 'em at the foreign money exchange
New Armani leather in the Range
When you see my gang, tuck in your chain
We stuck in the game, we f***in the same, bang!

[Chorus: INC]
[Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business (bang!)
[B.C.] Shout out my n****z en route to riches (bang!)
[B.C.] I doubt we different, hustlers pitchin (bang!)
[B.C.] And we all gon' get away, all my n****z say
[Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business (yeah!)
[B.C.] Whatta, bout my b****es who mouth is ridiculous (yeah!)
[B.C.] Gettin money and n**** it's insignificant (yeah! what?)
[B.C.] Always get your pay, I love it when I hear 'em say

[Black Child]
It's back to business, stackin riches
If you, act suspicious, it's a Wrap like Reynolds
Black Continental, mac outta the window
Black's out of his mental, I black out with pistols
It ain't confidential, all the s*** I been through
Now I'm gettin money and a mill' is essential
Bang bang, n****, 'til the day we die
A tooth for a tooth and a eye for a eye

[Caddillac Tah]
N**** you know it's, business befo' pleasure, money over chicks
Dummies in the clip, nickel on my hip patrollin through the strip
Bet a stack, head crack, no rollin to the six
Scoop up my chips, then I split, with my beautiful b****
Like Jada Pinkett Smith, for that paper I leave stinkin and stiff
Your pinky and wrist, and your necklace
Get removed n****, my wolves is playin hardball
Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl

[Chorus]
[Ja Rule]
Who want to know why I got so much beef with so many rappers?
Drama, it's the INC redrum spun backwards
Karma, is a muh'f***er watch your actions
Cause the clip to the max slips in bananas
I catch fire like matches {*whew*} then blow out
And the flyest crews goin the fastest
Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on
No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor
Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster
Doin this s*** for ten years, n****z I'm major
Maybach and all that, same behaviour
Money over b****es, b****es over strangers
Guns befo' bangers but bangers do
For n****z that had enough and ain't got no clue
that they can get slayed, flex and get sprayed
And spin they head like yo' hottest DJ's, motherf***ers!
