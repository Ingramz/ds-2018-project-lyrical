Rainbow Kitten Surprise,"I'm a master of matchbox guitar sessions
You're a master of passive-aggressive magic tricks
Like, that's not a card that I would've picked but it's your life to live like how you'd like to live
You're type of cool that likes to talk a lot
I'm the type of fool to listen
They say a wise man lends his ears but not his thoughts often
The same is true of undercover cops

And the undercover bubbler got me doubly high as heaven
We're still under the radar, seven billion on the planet
Wading straight to the moon
Salutations to Apollo
While the Mission To Mars is surely soon to follow
And you bit my lip when I kissed you
I bit my tongue not to tell you that I miss you
We shared my blood for an instant and I would trade some more to have it back
Yeah I would trade all of this for that

I'm in the back of a fifteen passenger van doing an expose on feelings I don't fully understand
Started a matchbox guitar slow jam
With hope just as large as the room in my car
My career went as far as the can that I kicked down the road for awhile until I'm just settled in
Hold it for change from charitable donors like
Excuse me sir, miss could you spare a moment to

Support local support local
I know I should've been more vocal
Sure, I could've been more social
I've been hanging out it's a short rope though
It's been awhile I should've wrote but I'm going postal
I'm GOING POSTAL
I've been coasting
I've been coping okay for the most part

Everybody I know wants to be a star
Just above the atmosphere flying high
Just above the average fear to try
Keeping me grounded, holding me down for miles
Everybody I know wants the gleam
In designer tops and ten dollar magazines
Infatuated with the beams, you go crazy when I speak
Aggravated when I say what I mean
I mean, I mean

You see, is that
I'm a master of matchbox guitar sessions
You're a master of passive aggressive magic tricks
Like: that's not the card that I would've picked but it's your life to live like you'd like to live
You're the master of Matlock lock picking lessons
I'm the asshole who keeps laughing at our predicaments
Like this ain't the life that I should've picked
But it's the cards we're dealt we play with
Shit",Matchbox,2018
Rainbow Kitten Surprise,"I ain't trying to paint you conclusions
It's pay to play rules and
Today's a day for suit and tie celebration
Nailed it hammered loose and I'm

Falling down with shit caked in my shoes
I ain't feeling this pair of 2s
Ante up or just fold boy
Take a whirl or take to
Fakin' it baby

I've been patient watching you the way move
Detecting all of your clues
Feeding off of your cues like 1 2 3 4 5
I'll get it right and play nice soon as you do

Running off again running off of gin and cigarettes
Front talking it's a cakewalk till I miss a step
Make it there take a breath and start popping a sweat
This molly got me in all my days
I've never seen a show stopper like you
Calling out the moves soon as you make em up, just a touch
Could make a boy act stupid
Take my delusions grind up into your bowl
Puff on that till I'm blue green serpentine
Visions snaking out of our tea
Not sure what it all means
But I could get used to seeing your cool demeanor lighting my scene up
Tripping all day til we keeping our knees up
Dripping always til our sins look cleaner
Walking down mazes in our minds to find our ways permeate
The walls in your room

Permanent as all we been through

Face in
Placate
Flake out
For miles, for mine, for I know
You could sell me on anything
Reach for the telephone or let it ring
Teach me to let it go
I think no luck nothing but us in violence
I hate fighting when I'm driving
Leave me now or leave cagey for 25 exits
Davis coltrane white lines exchanged in silence

Service fell off in the underground
Caught the line back to your basement
Came with

Fear in my heart
Cold to the touch
Love ain't enough a drug to make us
Make us make amends
You and i, we've been friends through screens
The screens, the screen-door's coming off the rails
Come in, come in

Come off the rails
Failed to reveal appeals apparent to my soul
Call me back if you wanna talk
Long distance collecting love
Strong feelings ain't enough to break the silence holding us
Hold my phone
If you needed me then, then, then, why wouldn't you bring it up?
Then why wouldn't we be together if ""all that we need is us"" ain't too much as ask for?
Nah it ain't too much
Ain't too much
I hate to say that I miss you first but
Send my love send my love right away baby
All day all night I wish you would leave me
Hurting
I know us is more than we deserve but
If I may and you're awake I'll be coming home late
It'd be cool if I could stay for a minute
Baby lately I've been waiting
To feel your mood move me

I love the way you know how
I love the way you walk out
I love the way you shut it
Down
Now

Rainbow Kitten Surprise,"Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made PAiNkillers

Count your blessings early before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes PAiNkillers

Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief

My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one

She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run

What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you

Rainbow Kitten Surprise,"She's the edge between the sacred and profane
And means at least one other language you would never speak in polite company
She's a dancer, lone riddle in the answer
She auditioned for romantics
But no calls from the right company

She'll never love the way you need her to, darlin'
You'll never lift her at all
She only wants the man she thinks is you, darlin'
You'll only take her if you think you could lose
So what if I don't find you, take you back?
I only want what I can't have
If you love me, give me nothing
But
Polite company

We're the dance among the drunklegs, a contest between
Untied lace, pop-shoegaze, and 808 heartbreak
We both caught the pace of two hearts, offbeat

What will hold you when the dance is through?
Put your back against the wall
Follow syncopated water fountain conversation
Making love inside a crayon covered bathroom stall
What if I don't find you, take you there?
I only want what I can't have
If you love me, give me nothing
Nothing

Some simple math
Two I can add
I ain't writing it down
I remember now what you came for, where your aim is
Maintain it
Try to burn the right glow
I'll be on my way out
I'll be over soon
Sober later
Fire that only I'd know
You've been on my radar
Are you lonely too?
'Cause your coast is clear to get a hold on me

And on these walls another language we would never speak

Rainbow Kitten Surprise,"I feel like a cat pulling strings
Think I unraveled my mind
I dropped a mouse into the sink just to watch it climb out
Then took it to the woods and said you're free
You'll be living like this for awhile now
You're free
For awhile now at least

You say cupid, I say comet
You say wallace, I say gromit
You brought it back when I said
You promised to just call the whole thing off, please
You stay needy, I stay friendless
You stay pristine, I stay pretentious
We'd get married but it's too expensive
Let's call the whole thing off, please
Oh. My. God
This ain't a happening to me
And it's all your fault
Said by popular decree
Possum queen by law, she's been building up estates in east l.A

Is this your first time? That's sweet
Say ""hello"" to looking-forward for me
If I could set your mind at ease
This will last forever
And when it doesn't, love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
The way I used to
If you love it, love it for what it's been
Don't miss it
Don't wish it back

You're caps on some letters the Devil won't recognize
You emphasize politeness
Policy got to me battered but hard to beat heart beating
And I'm deaf and I'm dumb and I'm numb
But I empathize to reconcile and save time
Screaming your feeling repeating your needs
I can read when you seethe
I repeat I know grief when I see it
Believe me, I know
Creature fear creeping up seeking the weak in us
Quit picking meat from us wolf in the sheep in us
Preaching it justice
Preaching adjustment
I should just shut up and cut the
Goddamn lights off

Trust me there's a few ways to renew faith
It's too late to earn those all (just)

Rainbow Nation,"Hey lady, you, lady, cursin' at your life
You're a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had a talked to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh I've been to Georgia and California, oh, anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady, don't just walk away
Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies

Oh I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things
That a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is? It's a lie. A fantasy we create about
People and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding, and it's that man you fought with
This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to cryin' for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life and never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free

And lives in semi luxury 
Questions God, drugs and bullets

And she's courageous but scared to death

The books and the stereo her muse
She feels humbled by this equation 
And sets fire to all her shoes
Not because of Henry Miller
She's just not leaving anytime soon
And as the smoke pours out her window
An image forms behind the moon
And it looks like the face of Jesus
But if it's Jesus she needs proof

We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
No, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does
I listen to my favorite song
It's playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Raining Jane,"Feeling less than my ordinary self I guess I must be getting older
The fog already heavy on my mind evokes a time that's turning colder
At breakfast the effect is picturesque
The window opens up and lets in
The Santa Ana winds again

She's a silent love song
Never stays long
Does not belong to any person
Though she's opening the curtains in my head
She's a kind of quiet
And always hides it in a flame
She's certainly a hurricane

Strange how such a gust of gentile breeze can ravage hearts across California
You start to grow accustomed to her turn around
She's gone of course she warned ya
She sometimes passes in a single night
And other times she lasts the weekend

She's a silent love song
Never stays long
Does not belong to any person
Though she's opening the curtains in my head
She's a kind of quiet
And always means just what she says
She's certainly a hurricane in bed

And tangles up inside and under covers
Angled in her way seen as a struggle
But two lovers we're always in the end
And the Santa Ana winds again

I've been stealing hearts
Where I don't belong (she's a silent love song)
I'm breathing hard (does not belong to any person)
When you come on strong (like a hurricane)
The more I love (you never have to say you're sorry)
The less I know (Anna don't cry)
Anna don't go",Silent Love Song,2008

I'm so glad that you're still the same, with the same name. I love the person you became
I want to be just like you, just like you
And I'm so glad that you're not hostile, that you're wearing a smile & care less about style
I want to be just like you, just like you

To have you on my side fills me with pride, stronger then a castle inside
I cannot throw anger at you, I'm attached to you, you've been with us since our debut
I'm glad that you're still the same, with the same name.
I love the person you became and I want to be just like you

Let me dedicate this song to those who never act in frustration
Let me give this song to those who have respect for all the punk bands in the nation
Let me pass this song to all the people that dare to disagree
Let me dedicate this song to those who downloaded this song as a mp3

I'm so glad that you're still the same, with the same name. I love the person you became

And let his anger run the way up her back, 
A disgusting attack and then everything went black.

You're locked away in chains and emotions doesn't help you (now).

Raison D'Etre,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",Old Rugged Cross,2003
Raison D'Etre,"Life is just too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea's too strong

Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue north

In a small suburban garden
Not a single neighbour knows our name
I know the woman wishes we would move some place
Where the houses aren't all the same

Jesse, I wish you would take mewhere the grass is greener
I couldn't really say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a montain top
Bown by the deep blue sea

And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

One day I'll be old gray Grandpa
All the pretty girls will call me ""Sir""
Now where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things are

Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies
To the shade of the old pawpaw

There we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

Life is just too short for some folks
For other foks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea's too strong

Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride in the middle

Turn it up, when ya feel alone
Turn it up, let the volume flow
Turn it up, if it feels good
Turn it up, when you know you should

From the scene of yet another murder mystery 
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered 
We have no information at this time 

(I won't be insulting and try to transcribe it)

As I look up at the sky 
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye 
My body temperature falls 
I'm shaking, and they breaking, trying to save the Dogg 
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming 
I stop breathing, damn I see daemons 
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me 
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby 
I think it's too late for praying, hold up 
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
""Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"" 
And how long will I live? 
""Eternal life and forever"" 
And will I be, the G that I was? 
""I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of 
So relax your soul, let me take control 
Close your eyes my son""

I'm fresh up out my coma 
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner 
It's gonna take a miracle they say 
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway 
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet 
And everything that nigga said, came to reality 
Living like a baller loc 
I'm having money, and blowing hella chronic smoke 
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag 
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad 
""Just remember who changed your mind 
'cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine"" 
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed 
Never have a want, never have a need 
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo' 
Cause my eyes want to journey some more, really doe (check it out) 

Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the lord, my soul to keep 
If I should die, before I wake 
I pray the lord, my soul to take 

Murder was the case that they gave me 
""Murder was the case that they gave me"" [Repeat: x2]

No more indo, gin and juice 
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the gray goose 
Shackled from head to toe 
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know 
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face 
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care 
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair 
Niggas stare as I enter the center 
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay 
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor 
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off 
Cause you can't tell what's next 
My little homey Baby Boo he took a pencil in his neck 
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two 
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Fuck niggaz who hatin I got (love for you)
Middle fingers I keep'em (up for you)

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Met her at the shisha spot
Golden locks and a Laker top
Pretty face, eyes, and smile to match
Didn't wanna rush or go too fast
Sat back and just kicked it
Steady flow conversation for a couple minutes
I smiled, she laughed
Minutes turn to hours as they rolled past

Now, I'm sat here with just her name
Never to know if she feels the same
But guess what
I got a message Mrs. M saying we should meet again
And I'm like

Let me tell you somethin', baby girl, you frontin'
A girl who talks about it but you never really done it
You're lost in the moment from the moment that you spun it
A spiders web for the men to just come and get stuck in
We are just friends and friends just stay friendly
A flirtatious mind but, girl, don't tempt me
Uh, I'm a man at the end of the day
So let's just keep it cool 'cause rules I like to break
I ain't breaking any if you keeping it calm
Last chance for you to dance and get up in my arms
Our arms are linked but not tied at the heart
It's hard 'cause your heart just wants to be charmed, oh my

Rakaa,"Moshpit rowdy, party people shouting
Crazy in the crowd but the silence is the loudest
When Babs cuts the beat my ears still ringing
The emptiness is deafening, the houselights beaming
And the fans start leaving and the man starts sweeping
It all seems surreal like I can't stop dreaming
Bartenders and the soundman cleaning
But minutes ago people were dancing on the ceiling
Fiending for that buzz 'til the dawn breaks night
I crash barely with the high but I still take flight
Fighting isolation but I won't chase the fame
But moths can't help it, born to chase the flame
Twists up and sips up and to erase the same
Darkness served with the bitter taste of pain
Raised in Hollywood but real life is more than stranger
It's the sun shining from my California manger

I never thought that life was gonna be this way
But every battle I fight makes me stronger ever day
And Lord knows I've been through some low valleys
Even though my clothes are torn, my pride is strong
I'm still king in my crown of thorns

I cipher to the team, mixtape to a family
I battled the hustler's hand with my life, gambling
Redirection is the key to fifty-two choose one
Baby born with black magic, maybe time to use some
Now I'm the only thing stopping me
Elders told me ""walk free"" when they gave me prophecy
But that option was not to be
Though I did know it can be difficult to talk to me
Yeah we could have done more probably
But we did what we did do properly
Now I'm older than I thought I'd be
I'm holding less property and money flowing awkwardly
But blessed with a spiritual empire
Inspired to purify em, I just fan the flames and fuel the fire
Tick-tock, no time to live life scared
Spread my arms like Christian Hosoi, Christ Air

I never thought that life was gonna be this way
But every battle I fight makes me stronger ever day, yes it does
And Lord knows I've been through some low valleys
Even though my clothes are torn, my pride is strong
I'm still king in my crown of thorns

In the room full of mirrors I sit and reflect
So I can correct any defects
Ev told me I could be more emo
Then I just laughed and said f**k that, we need more Primo
He nodded in agreement, ashes on the cement
Feet to the pavement walking on the deep end
Messiah footprints all over the industry
No love for the enemy, rappers are puppets
Look close just see the cables
Look up you see the hand
Look back you see the labels
De facto lawyer learn to read the fine print
Learned the Latin and Shakespearian that contract's in
Expansion team still scoring at will
Angel's the old Cristo Redentor in Brazil
Even so low the family that I brought is real
F**k the rumours, Dilated got it on lock still

I never thought that life was gonna be this way
But every battle I fight makes me stronger ever day, yes it does
And Lord knows I've been through some low valleys
Even though my clothes are torn, my pride is strong
I'm still king in my crown of thorns",Crown of Thorns,

The will to win, the spark within

That is not one of them, blacking out to Budgie
On the kick drum however is, made some notables
Worth remembering, dilated emblems
If the wind blows you'll find me floating
Everything's slow motion when I'm smoking
The smell is potent, life is vibrant, still shining, everything timing
I'll be at the shore, no vacation
On a tour saying color combination
I met some people, we started talking
They said stop, youse a dead man walking
It's not a cliché, but this is take one
Make it great, it don't matter if you take long
I don't take shorts, I don't steal shirts
I only got good, I don't deal dirt
I'm a simple man, not a simpleton

Glass ceiling, use the custom model, peek-a-boo
Sending lefts and rights through, taking you to flight school

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo
Y que algun dia me puedas perdonar

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar

Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras

Rakim,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Funky...
",Eric B. Is President,1987
Rakim,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on 
You sweat as you step about to get hype 
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic 

You're physically in this with me but how could you tell 
If it's meant to be hip hop if you're not mentally as well 
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured 
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored 

If you just keep kickin' listen, to the mix 
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand 
Holds and controls you 'til I leave 
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe 

The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then 
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhymes' the oxygen 
Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you 
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue 

And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously 
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be 
Rising to the top, and I came to drop it 
Catch it and quiz it, is my topic 

Universual 'cause I move everybody to come 
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one 
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get 
I draw a crowd, like an architect 

The five borroughs react and all the islands attract 
And every state can't wait, so they attack 
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed 
It'll be more room if MC's play the back 

I'm the are the A to the K-I-M 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am 
The microphone fiend if I was a fake 
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make 

I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite 
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like 
The voice on the record, I see what you mean 
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream 

So just, give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it 
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well 
Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells 

I took time to write, tonight I will recite 
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight 
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin 
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin 

Home to tell a friend when the party ends 
""Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"" 
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage, 
Tape by tape and page by page, 

When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix 
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets 
Deeper and Deeper, I hope you understand it 
I made it up myself and I planned it 

For other MC's who waste time 
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme 
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating 
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking 

They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' 
To get up on the microphone and then start takin' 
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it 
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet 

Attracted to a freestyle put in effect 
You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet 
So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) 
Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, 

I want you to hear this perfectly clear 
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea? 
I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song 
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on...",As the Rhyme Goes On,1987

Rakim,"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up convert it in a hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
Cause you'll get fried in the end if you pretend to be
Competing cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme wit yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stun
Remember me, the one you got your idea from
But soon you start to suffer but you only get rougher
When you start to stutter that's when you had enough of
Biting it, I make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should of broke cause I ain't no joke

I got a question, it's serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pack then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood chores
The e-m-c-e-e don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those 7 mc's
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat dj, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait til e say
Play 'em, so I'mma have to dis and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke

I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation cause when I invent
I nominated my dj the president
When I'm senile, people freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
They'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiendin'
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the r so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
Cause I'm moving the crowd and b a record fader
No interruptions and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And take you for a walk through hell
Feed your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple state darkness
When it get dark again then I'mma spark this
Microphone cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finish when the beat is gone, I'm no joke",I Ain't No Joke,1987
Rakim,"Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
Cause when I heard the beat I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It's simple ain't it, but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make
Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long cause I'm a move on
The dance floor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
Cause I like to move the crowd

Imagine me with the heat that's made by solar
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth is shut
Cause I'm on the mic and Eric b is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praises due to Allah and that's a blessing
With knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving",Move the Crowd,1987
Rakim,"[Verse One: ]



Turn up the bass  check out my melody  hand out a cigar 

I'm lettin knowledge be born  and my name's the are 

A k i m not like the rest of them  I'm not on a list 

That's what I'm sayin  I drop science like a scientist 

My melody's in a code  the very next episode 

Has the mic often distortin  ready to explode 

I keep the mic in Fahrenheit  freeze MC's and make em colder 

The listener's system is kickin like solar 

As I memorize, advertise, like a poet 

Keep you goin when I'm flowin, smooth enough, you know it 

But rough that's why the middle of my story I tell E.B. 

Nobody beats the ""are"", check out my melody... 



[Verse Two:] 



So what if I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I sing 

One of these for MC's so they don't have to scream 

I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test 

Then let my melody play, and then the record suggest 

That I'm droppin bombs, but I stay peace and calm 

Any MC that disagree with me just wave your arm 

And I'll break, when I'm through breakin I'll leave you broke 

Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke 

So stand back, you want to rap? All of that can wait 

I won't push, I won't beat around the bush 

I want to break upon those who are not supposed to 

You might try but you can't get close to 

Because I'm number one, competition is none 

I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun 

Whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall 

I just writin my name in graffiti on the wall 

You shouldn't have told me you said you control me 

So now a contest is what you owe me 

Pull out your money, pull out your cut 

Pull up a chair, and I'ma tear shit up 

My name is Rakim Allah, and are & A stands for ""Ra"" 

Switch it around, but still comes out ""are"" 

So easily will I e-m-see-e-e 

My repetition of words is ""check out my melody"" 

Some bass and treble is moist, scratchin and cuttin a voice 

And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice 

I wouldn't have came to set my name around the same weak shit 

Puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit 

In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone 

I take this more serious than just a poem 

Rockin party to party, backyard to yard 

Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods 





[Verse Three: ]



The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp 

I can swing off anything even a string of a harp 

Just turn it on and start rockin, mind no introduction 

Til I finish droppin science, no interruption 

When I approach I exercise like a coach 

Usin a melody and add numerous notes 

With the mic and the are-a-k-i-m 

It's a task, like a match I will strike again 

Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped 

Put in order to pursue with the momentum except 

I say one rhyme and I order a longer rhyme shorter 

A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder 



[Verse Four: ]



I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor 

Melody arranger, poet, etcetera 

Extra events, the grand finale like bonus 

I am the man they call the microphonist 

With wisdom which means wise words bein spoken 

Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin 

I came to express the rap I manifest 

Stand in my way and I'll lead a ??? words protest 

MC's that want to be dissed they're gonna 

Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta 

All they can go get is me a glass of Moet 

A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet 

I take 7 MC's put em in a line 

And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme 

Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine 

And that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time 

Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin 

No fessin, no messin around, no chewin 

No robbin, no buyin, bitin, why bother 

This slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow 

My unusual style will confuse you a while 

If I was water, I flow in the Nile 

So many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's 

Just because of a cause I have to pause 

Right after tonight is when I prepare 

To catch another sucka duck MC out there 

'cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe 

And after this you'll call me your majesty 

My melody... 





[Verse Five: ]



Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it 

Eric be	 made a cut and advertised it 

My melody's created for MC's in the place 

Who try to listen 'cause I'm dissin 

Take off your necklace, you try to detect my pace? 

Now you're buggin over ?off my rhyme like bass 

The melody that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin 

Rough enough to break New York from Long Island 

My wisdom is swift, no matter if 

My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff 

I'm genuine like leather, don't try to be clever 

MC's you'll beat the ""are"", I'll say ""Oh never"" 

So Eric be	 cut it easily 

And check out my melody...",My Melody,1987

Play the hum leaning back checking out the action
On the benches we drinkin x's
Yo twirl dat shit, while i spark this...
Sharply burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz cause its time to bring the biz to kidz
And blow all hell fire out ya empire
Live as wire couldn't make my mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
You set quite wit my head full of riot.
Our buyers, it clear for your ear to hear
I declare only live niggaz lock this year
'96-i lost my dun; '97-it got worse..
Pull money out the team, got to get mork..
And sat down you play the background when shots sound off
Flashbacks of how my man is gone, kb forever in my memory
I spill some henny then i keep it moving

{Chorus}:
Yo, do our thing, we got this, rockin' this
ain't nobody stoppin this rakim and imfamous
Reck the hood for you and yours-no doubt crash the bars
You don't really want to go against the source

[Big Noyd]
Surprise open eye, peep the foulness, wildness
Its bug, niggaz dug in the projects you holiday thug
Ease up all that illin and grillin
Get ya melon lite up, you niggaz is butt
You want me, i'm reppin wb, what?
Where you find me at spillin congac from a cup
With my heat next to my nuts
Never been afraid to bust
Slug rushin to your head like dust
If that wasn't enough as long as strong and tough
We squeeze back, better believe he no longer breath-black
Fuckin wit these swayze cats
I got dreams of raising my little queen and nobody gonna stop that
In fact black, if you come at me don't come sloppy
All my baby girl got is a papi to guide her
Through this world of hatred
And i die to see that she make it
And die to let the nextman take it, is you stupid, um...

[Rakim]
Yo, you want to come test, son is mad from stress
Penalty is death, pay your last respects
We harass you reap if you slept or half step
We adapt to see who we can master next
After sex pass the bless for after effects
Relax your stress through mad physac, mad contact
Cash a check to get assets we blast techs
Dealing with the mental aspect on chest
So we create a trust, if you dunns come to shot
Get hit with a twenty-one gun salute
I keep a loaded yet deadly 7sc 30
Soon as you it hit me i release lyrics of fury
And quick to say a poem to ricochet in your dome
My click made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone
So i can get chatter and be the better trend setter
The 18th letter forever

Rakim,"What yo 
Just when things seemed the same  and the whole scene is lame 
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change 
They strain to slang sling  I'm trained to bring game 
History that I arranged been regained by King James 
Go to practice  with tactics  when the track hits  theatrics 
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's 
Stacks of mathematics took the ?ego-a-geatics? 
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic 
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is 
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers 
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious 
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses 
Shine permanently only my mind's concerning me 
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity 
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary 
Determinedly advance technology better than Germany 
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over 
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah 
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom 
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn 
From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures 
I study I know the scriptures but nowadays ain't it vicious 
Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran 
To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on 
So being beneficent, I bless em with dialogue 
They expecting, the next testament by the God 
I blow em through battle zones with chrome for chaperon 
Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known 
Every country city and borough, side street and ghetto 
Isle and alley and meadow theories fertile enough to echo 
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man 
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan 
Since the world's metamorphosis, and the plan is kept in orbit 
Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it 
Rhythms we expressing similar to our ancestors 
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message 
From the days of the slave choppers?, to the new age of prophets 
As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it 
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs 
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme 

[Repeat: x2]

Rakim,"""Once again back is the incredible""

Yeah, yeah
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashing hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorching hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smoking ten dollar cigars
While I admire midas, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catching diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slamming track
Rocking jams by popular demand, I'm back

[Chorus]
I control the crowd, you know I hold it down
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world reknowned
And I rock New York City all year around

Check it out
It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with something potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floating
Hot science is smoking altitudes cause choking
Product is hypnotic you're soaking and still smoking
Showing better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumping
I'ma move crowds to 2000

[Chorus]

Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam
I take advantage, until the crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts then I lust to touch
Microphones get clutched by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be dropping this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic

[Chorus: x2]

""Once again, back is the incredible"" 
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, ya know what I mean?
""Rakim Allah"" 
Till death do us part
""Once again, back is the incredible""
It's on

Follow procedures, the crowd couldn't wait to see this
Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this, I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
with Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics
Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on and, I got the whole world responding
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning
The Emperor, well known for, inventing a sentence
full of adventure, turning up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
to be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

When I'm out propping, either, hanging or shopping
People see me stop and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over, in-formation like a soldier
like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital, taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you
Hey yo, technical difficulties is through

""It's been a long time""
""Rakim, the microphone soloist""
""It's been a long time""
""Rakim, the microphone soloist""
""It's been a long time""
""Rakim, the microphone soloist""
""It's been a long time""
""It's been a long time""

When I float at night, I show em new heights, I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like ""internet.com""
My note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But no I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So yo I'm online, it's been a long time

If you can see if you can solve the mystery
The answer revolves around your history
So carefully, I drop this degree
Scientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)

In eternal blackness, in the midst of the darkest night
Proteins and minerals, exist within specks of light
Solids liquids and gases, and sparks of light within
Infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights
No beginning or ending, the seven dimensions
Enough space for more than a million words and inventions
To travel through time within enough room to be the womb
Of the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine
With intelligent elements in sight that he will gather
In the realms of relativity electricity struck matter
Energies explode he below to keep releasing
Atoms by the millions, til the numbers increasing
Til it was burning he kept returning itself to the source
The hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force
He gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws
All caused by his mental intercourse, who is God?

He began to explain his craft, the master in the attic
He dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics
His theoretical wisdom of the numerical system
The complete number nine which means born or existed
He gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic
So you wouldn't take it for granted
They rotated they own distance around the sun
And fully submit to the existence of one
And each one was promised everlasting perfection
If each one keeps spinning in the same direction
To the East, and each speak the motion of peace
And harmony, and each show devotion to teach
The universe is to come, the whole world must go according
Know your galaxies and mirages stars start falling
So stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound
Like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round

From unconsciousness, to consciousness
By knowledging his wisdom his response is this
A understanding, which is the best part
He picked the third planet where new forms of life would start
He pursued show and prove every move in order
Back to the source he let off his resources in the water
Climb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees
See he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas
And the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land
And expand, usin the same clays to born man
In his own image our origin begins in the East
Culture rise to breed, with the powers of peace
Deal in equality nature's policy is to be God
Build or destroy positively born life like Allah
And each one was given everlasting perfection
If each one keep living in the same direction
And life was life, and love was love
We went according by the laws of the world above
They showed us physically, we could reach infinity
But mentally, through the century we lost our identity
Life start and ending, we got trife and started sinning
Lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinning
And what was once easy became confused and hard
Which brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God?
Sixty-six trillion years since his face was shown
When the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known
Check Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John
It even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran
Wisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God
G.O.D. you and me Gomars O Dubar

Hey yo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress
Streets a matter of life and death, no regrets
Life's a test, strife, wit special effects
Neighborhood's full of reps, cities are projects
Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
And comrades quest to be the next, to fitness 
Collect debts and select bets with death threats
Object, chedder, better your total net
Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat
The smell of gun smoke more common than cigarettes

We got clicks for wreck
We like Pits for pets
We got Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets
We like much respect and sex extra wet
And high-tech dialect you ain't catch yet

The Bronx,
Ya out there?
No doubt
Brooklyn,
Ya out there?

Hey yo, we got blocks and glocks with
Big shots with big knots and big props
Yo this is where the bullshit stops
Where herbs get got, if you snitch you get shot
We get down and leave the town in a state of shock
We got dangerous hang out spots and slick cops
Place called Riker's Island where kids get locked
A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
Styles are top notch, this is the place to watch
So bust the box, the radio station is Hot
Ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops
Flip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot
Quick to call a shot, politic with thick plots
And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got
To make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot
Where seeing's believing, we be achieving a lot
Since disc jocks created hip hop, check it out!

Queens, ya out there?

Manhattan? 
No doubt
New York City, Staten Island
New York, New York, Long Island
New York, ya out there?

Hey yo, we got five boroughs of ghettos
With many places to meet, you get lost in city streets
The city that never sleeps
Mecca, Medina the population increase
The desert and the oasis, New York, the far East
With Gods and Sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks
Player dons that fleece the family's black sheep
Icons that teach that we all act unique
We got stats to reach so we all have to eat
A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece
The crafts elite, we going past the beat
The latest technique no other place get as deep
Who parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes
DJ's and MC's and graffiti artists
Who use walls and subway trains for marquees

Turn the beat up, I get lost in the mind come across
The rhyme kick my feet up, then I find myself in time
I was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain
I entertained things'll never be the same
DJ's are conveyed if the label OK it
Teddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it
On the radio, with the crazy flow
I pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show
When I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm
In control and leave your soul overwhelmed
Another influence of beats and instruments
Lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense
When you was playing Pac Man it was the jams I packed
Peeps would swarm when I was perform in, black I'm all that
Back before they turned hip-hop to rap
It always a place to party at, remember that?

I remember the spots that used to be hot
Just like the roof top, a place that only few can rock
On a wild ass block, yeah you find me there a lot
Until you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops
Here come the cops, time to go home, get in order
Cause I'll be back in Manhattan if somethings happening at the Latin Quarter
House of havoc when it came to fourteen carat
And if you had it yeah kids'd try to grab it
It's cool at the Red Parrot we was doing it there
I was the first one to rip it at the Union Square
Me and DJ Red Alert did work
A crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt
I did encores at the Encore, they wanted more
I kicked a freestyle til I heard the crowd roar
Like the Funhouse, Bronx Center never ending black
Place to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that?

Open the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand
Wilding music's loud and microphone's growling
Tickets are sold out, parties is packed and on tour
Ripping basketball arenas back then
Even after parties, posses of players and hotties
Everybody was Gotti, spreading bucks like shotties
Spending cash, to make a good time last
Thoughts that I had give me a blast of the past
Memories of unforgettable times on my mind
Dollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes
The people I met, and the sets that got wrecked
All the mics I checked, most of all life's effects
And peace to all the people I grew up around
In the streets back when beats had a rougher sound
I used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile
Keep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile
Cause some things are just too good to be forgot
Like your neighborhood block or your favorite spot
Certain records always seem to make me reminisce
And when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this
My life flashed before me I'm there from the sounds
I hear pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear
I like the way it went down and Allah that, in fact
It mean a lot, cause you can't bring it back, remember that

I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins
If I get sloppy and sin, then my prophesy ends

So soon you and your peoples can bum rush the store

Around the way-in, swerve on, surveying

Expression her possession of property skyrocket
I'm investing in her presence and in time it profits

Studied her exhibits and checked her colorful curves

And actions but mind frame hard to explain

Is migraines, the x-rated though remains
We relaxing, and you nagging me for the agony
To your anatomy, by the fractions
Your measurements, the pleasure's in every inch of your temple
I travel twenty-three million miles of your mental
Chemistry, between you and me, in harmony
Causing angles to meet, like trigonometry
Or pyramids, that's where your deepest, treasures are hid
Then it gets, odoriferous, cause I know where it is
I mastered that, cause it's easy when you react

Pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders
I take my time, and find where the right one is
Smooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math
And on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz
And when I see the whiz I'ma step to my biz
And there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz
It's appropriate we go get soaking wet
Toast, we met, become close associates
The place is ours by now I can embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Chorus]
Why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you

We on the low mating, infiltrating, negotiating
We both be making moves and dough, M.O.'s relating
She ain't taking I want it but yo I know she waiting
I throw the bait in, and before you know we dating
I want the format, to the doormat
Contacts fast, callbacks and all that
Your deepest ecstasy see you wear accessory
Your secret recipes to your bear necessities
She real exotic body feel like Lucile Roberts
Name brand closets, culturized products
Claws like a scorpion caught me in deeper
But juice sweeter, enough to buy a two seater
Every mile I plan to have your mind beguiled
Til it informs me more than you would normally allow
Raised more than an eyebrow with a flagrant style
By now I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Chorus]

Sometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited
But she know I like it, she know the deal like a psychic
Mind is haunted, because I always find her on it
She know what I want, where I want, when I want it
Blowing up my Motorola, daddy you coming over?
She on the sofa, holding a remote controller
Candles burning lower, favorite dish getting colder
She hot as solar, cause I told her I wanna hold her
But her mission she sitting in one position like Yoda
A TV show is on to top it off she dead sober
Then I open the door up, and kiss her on the shoulder
She say I'm rolling, like Mr. Lover Lover
We had a hard day, ready to parlay
My thirsts they obey everything that God say
Okay let's play awhile and I'll embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile

Rakim,"Yes yes y'all, check it out y'all [Repeat: x2]

[Chorus]
(Yo) I find a show, rhyme til it's time to go
I'm designed to blow, my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my M.O., making all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, ya know?

Yes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means
To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
Cause I mention many things and I'm presenting many scenes
Guess I'm telegraphic, motions energetic
Better tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic
Crowds is screaming, I choke the mic and keep squeezing
Styles seeming like I used a thousand words without breathing
Busting techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win
Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
Composing, then leave the mic full of corrosion
Don't test this, or best to expects this explosion
At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venom's
Killing syllables with poisonous synonyms in em
Ideas is blowing, mics is blowing
From what I'm showing, see it, I keep it going when I'm flowing

[Chorus]

When I'm flowing, theoretically speaking like a drummer
I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
Or illustrate, a time and place you never been in
And make you focus on the future after seeing the beginning
And my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet
Volume dial was kind of low, need to pump it
Up another notch turn the dial til it stops
More watts you got, more things to watch
Third eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory
Keep scoping til you hear me, words is spoken clearly
It's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showing
Man I keep it going, damn I keep it flowing

[Chorus: x2]

Two pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic
Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic
Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet
I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic
Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown
I hope your microphone's accident prone
Raw footage is shown, but only showing scenes of my own
Leaving your peripheral vision in a zone
But not the twilight, from the insight that I write
And recite, in my mic'll be bright, cause I like
The night glowing, it's out of sight when I'm showing
Man I keep it going, damn I keep it flowing

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, accurate tactics ""Make Em Clap to This""
When I ""Move the Crowd"", my ""Rhythm"" still don't miss
Breeze through melodies cause ""It's Been A Long Time""
My ""Lyrics"" is ""Fury"" and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
Every antidote that I quote, is ""No Joke""
Nobody's smiling ""In The Ghetto"" from the notes I wrote
My high techniques wreck and disrespect beats
Have you ""Follow-in The Leader"" up and down the streets
So ""Kick Along"" as I rip a song with pull
As the rhyme goes on I get ""Paid In Full""
It's Rakim, I'm indicating rhymes for the showing
Check it out y'all, I keep it going when I'm flowing

That you would want people to remember you by?
Or not one but the, those things that are dear to you
That you would, want to be remembered as

I guess, I guess it's my words man, you know what I mean?
Just my words, and, if people remember my words
They'll remember me forever you know?
God by nature mind raised in Asia, you know?

But umm, it's like you know to live forever you you you gotta
Set you know, not not set trends but you gotta
Apply yourself a certain way and you gotta do certain things you know?
Maybe, maybe when I'm gone twenty years from now
Somebody might be tellin', tellin' they little son
""Oh yo you think shorty bad? Yo I 'member this cat way back
In like nineteen-ninety, kid named Rakim, bananas""

You know what I'm sayin'?
If that can happen man, I'm aight man, you know?
I got, I got, I got kids you know?

Me anyway you know what I'm sayin'?
So regardless, you know the legacy lives

Here's the deal mama, me and you in the bahama
Begin the saga, I massage your persona
I got to have it, until it's automatic
Become a fanatic, until your aura is organic
It's more than my mystic when we come from here
Put my cheek on your cheek, and my tongue in your ear
Set the tone one touch is all it took
When I get busy disconnect the phone off the hook

[Jody Watley]
Unlike my past relations,
You were into more than friendly dating,
Didn't have no time for games,
Just state your claims 
And I feel just the same way about you,
Started out with just one touch, 
But I never knew I'd get good of it kissing, hugging you love to hear,

Off the hook is unexplainable,
Your love is off the hook,
It's so unattainable,
Between us this fire, desire inside your love is off the hook

How my man so sensitive and warm,
Knows what I want to me,
But give it to me and I'll do just the same for my man,

Hold your hands, give you hugs, and romance and kisses
Each glance is delicious, any stance is precious
Even sweat pants and slippers, while you doing the dishes
?? its shook, when you show off and cook
We're forced to look, yo baby you off the hook
Checking your measurements, it's precious and delicate
Highly intelligent, it's elegant elements
We've been friends for awhile now, I'm on the prowl
I know your style now, So I'ma make a bow
I put my charm on her, The Don Warner
I put the magic wand on her, and drop the bomb on her
Tender touches, now I lust for lady lucious
Show her what crazy love is, until the blood rushes
Step to my P.I., see why, cause she fly

And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare

For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check

But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""

Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays

You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite

Bite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues 
Put medicine in it before I kill ya dead

Could you walk? No, at least you thought though 
Auto fours blow a hole in your torso 
Damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow 
Try to say something now? I thought so! 
I leave emcee's bleeding while I'm fleeing across sea, and 
Start breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden 
Free on the weekend, come back see if he breathing 
They breathing, somebody left his brains beat in

Hey yo what's going on?
The Mic Lebanon Teflon Don,
I'm back baby
The year of the 9's
And I'ma have to make these motherfuckers a offer they can't refuse
Ya know?

Ha, what's going on?  Yo c'mon, you know it's on
I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn
Make sure the force is right, I floss all night
Get off the mic it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe
Keep em in the lie-bury, studying my theory
Ra theory get translated in Swahili
From the lands as far as Zanzibar
They understand the are, the man Allah
It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this
Soon as my data processes Y2K they floppy disk
Now who the hottest is? How can it not be this?
Baby who the cockiest? Papi is? Gracias
Hey , this be so, magnifico
Even my, typical, style difficult
Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show
Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?

[Chorus]
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo any club that I come to
I hit a microphone check one two
And they know what I want to do - flow forever

You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's cause y'all kiss the floor, say this my Lord
It's the chosen one, with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holding one
In the front row sitty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra the Conqueror
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode?  I guess so
Those that halved out, wanted to have clout
What they mad about?  Must be a cash route
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this they spaz out

[Chorus: x2]

Wherever Rakim go, it's the God temple
It's simple, my M.O., no problemo
Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at
I did the welcome mat, and then welcome back
My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-it-All
They want me to show em all my brand new protocol
Excuse-a-moi, I make a move for Ra
You ain't souping Ra, save the hoop-a-la
Let me find out you rhymed out designed out
Pulling dimes out then climb out, for time out
I'm at the free throw, playing ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough
Reloaded like Carlito, incognito
I be so, low key, women get nosy
I do a show they want to go see to get to know me
In the front row seat they cosy
Thinking I'm giving them the bo-bo-bee until they O.D.

[Chorus: x4]",Flow Forever,1999
Rakim,"[Rakim]
Before the dough came, my whole aim, was blow like propane
Control the whole domain, and then show no shame
Make rappers go ? and they so lame, playing with no game
Put em on the lil plane til they can't claim no fame
I got, the range, better, stay in the slow lane
I make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain
Your thoughts are so plane, I rearrange your whole frame
Until my whole name grow out your brain like Rogaine
Letter by letter, I put words together
Once merged, apart never, they be heard forever
And then I grab a pen and stab him in his abdomen
And smash him in, throw his mic like a javelin
Then I explain verses, that remain on the surface
At times it get deep, but I never defeat the purpose
Never go out, to go the dough route, forever hold out
I never sold out, for any amount, no doubt

[Chorus: x2]
That's how I get down, so tell me how you like that
I hit the town, hold it down on a tight track
I start a party now, everybody like rap
Haters are mad cause they gave the are the mic back

[Rakim]
I like to hang where everything seem to happen at (ya know?)
It's Ra's habitat, I'm like that czar Arafat
And yes I have a gat, snap like a Israeli
A terrorist I never miss blowing up kids daily
I step to writers, and let my virus hurt the closest
I'm sick as hepatitis and worse than tuberculosis
Pull out a pen, like a grenade, and drop it quick
I strike again and I'ma get paid, exotic shit
You know the God ra be, hot as the Mojave
Swing like King Usabi, my posse be kamikaze
On the corners like I'm homeless and I, don't know where home is
The bonus, is where the next open microphone is
Me and my team, vision like a radar screen
Intervene and yo, cut the mic off, cause Ra fiend
To show the whole world some of the things I seen
Then blow it up, like Edi Amin, ya know what I mean?

[Chorus]

[Rakim]
I do a thing thing, I write the songs they sing
Make sure that they swing, from New York to Beijing
Put your thoughts in the sling and your brain is gangrene
Pull in the ring, repeating and saying the same thing
Xerox, zero, no match, you ditto
Copy machine, couldn't reprint my ?
My new style, that I produce now's beyond two-thou'
I knew how, since a juvenile, to make a ka-pow
When the night's falling, I can hear the mic calling
I like balling, I cut back like Mic Jordan
This is for y'all while I'm spitting literature's
Lyrics'll ball like Allen Iverson dribble the ball
They hopeless, whoever approaches my high explosives
My vision sadicious, and freestyle's ferocious
I wrote this, words flew over my head like a locust
I turned the beat up, sat back, and stayed focused

[Chorus]",How I Get Down,1999
Rakim,"Aye yo, who's the most explosive one yet? 
The a roundest one left 
Who flows express to them rhythm drum set ain't done yet? 
Flow like a trumpet to your eardrum are deaf 
Who pose a threat? 
Yo, who's more ferocious, none yet 
To the night damn set mic trends and life ends 
In sight, I see the whole world through a tight lens 
Rhymes I write wins and kept a white Benz 
Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens 
I get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners 
When I flip it's the opposite of dark Bruce Banner 
Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear 
And just when it all seem clear I disappear 
All you gotta do is holler 
Reappear like vol,la the street scholar 
I'm 40 deep like Ali Baba 
Give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor 
Keep it hot like lava, yeah 
It's Rakim Allah 
  
[Chorus] 
I know you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic an 
I can do anything you wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance 
  
Ready to dance y'all, my magic carpet's the dance floor 
Last chance y'all even if you can't ball 
What part don't you understand? Your wish is my command 
And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand 
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby 
It gotta thug's twist,it start to get crazy 
It's off the meat rack, can't keep my peeps back 
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats 
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters 
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is 
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters 
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses 
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing 
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing 
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise 
'cause the beat's bangin', I'm born to blaze, baby boy 
  
[Chorus] 
  
The editor,forever more the predator, I said it all 
I spread a war, like never before 
Spit lead at yours like a ghetto braud raw at a? 
She'll never pause 
With raw metaphors, I set it off 
But I just begun the best is yet to come 
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young 
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns 
Test the one, let Allah protect your son 
Cause something musical magician, the ageiathic author 
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor 
You can explore, every sentence is a tour 
The inventor is more than adventure 
You'll be blown away, and a zone? 
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say 
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze 
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray 
  
[Chorus: x4]",I Know,1999
Rakim,"[Chorus]
I will always be there
I always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there

I'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass
All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life
I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the god at come back smellin' like cognac
Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair
Aye yo-the key here is repair this love we share
Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted
Love is bond, organic, restaurants romantic
Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet
But I take advantage and take you for granted
Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights
But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight

[Chorus]

(3rd verse)
Who said something good won't last forever
I know too much of any thing is bad whatever
Long as we have good and bad times together
Bad times make the good times that much better
Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life
You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you
And for the chill I will forever come real
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal
Now come feel, let's make this a done deal

[Chorus: x4]",I'll Be There [Featuring Nneka Morton],1999
Rakim,"If I lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll
Aye-yo I'm a terrorize charge and slay shows
Ra slay flows go as far as the Barbados
On the turntable sound like tornadoes
My style is performed like tropical storms
Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn
I keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in
Keep the models following wise as King Solomon
Come slow through the jungle like an animal
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal
From Long Island to Queens light up the New York scenes
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between
Left to go bless a show in Mexico
Next Thing I know it's extra cold I see Eskimo's
Time to rock get it hot soon as I get in there
Spit in they ear so flow they froze and I disappear

[Chorus: x2]
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family

They said I was a head of my time or either here before
To see the idea clear it takes a year or more
Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven
The silence's a set back make em regret that
One way to get back is violence and wet cats
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering
My sabotage is camouflage and espionage
You ain't having Ra so don't test the god
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters
I hit em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters
So warn a friend tell em it's on again
If it's a freestyle bust in a park I want in

[Chorus: x2]

I managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that
Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack
So reload the van go ahead let em in
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again
Surprise a town the place it's live and loud
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali
I'm worldwide my brothers be biggin' me up
Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad
Like Saddam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad

The host by far a mostly O.T., with a brand new show, but

Mix any kind of dope with me, you O.D.

Drop place to place, be crazy over me
Even different nationalities, over seas

Even with no jewelry she call me Goldie
Like a Jacuzzi, she overheat an O.G.
Like sushi swimmin' in a open sea, I'm comin'

She said it's the same since I came and reigned: it's still hard
You can stimulate the brain, feel the god
It's hard to go against the grain, it's real large
Drive 'em insane, leave dames in silk bras
Plus real cups spill, spill that bars
What's the deal? Kids with Hennessey grills , they feel charged
And you know what time it is? It's still Ra's
When I do a show real far, they steal cars
Stages of battle field reveal your scars
Train hard 'cause this is a game with ill squads
Play with pain and gain a couple of yards
And if you know the deal, you can deal the cards
And appeal to broads with jobs and ov,e,ods 
Body parts like buns of steel and spa's
Then we can kick tha blahzay blah, smoke a cigar

Now they're eager to know just how deep the flow get
I don't know yet, sometime the flow be so wet
Spit a tech that will effect quicker than most
Or high as anything you smoke, yet go ahead, roll it
Any microphone I hold, my heat blow it
My E,M,O is make more dough till I can't fold it
Anything I see or touch, I want to own it
Drop a jewel in baby girl ear, now she my co,ed

Steamin', speedin', navigatin' the map

Premeditated plan of attack, with two of your most deadliest men's in the back
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot

The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick

Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it

She want a rim shot all over her drum set 
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset

Standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
God dam eggplants, niggas getting' me vexed man 
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
And I can't seem to get away from it
I dreamed that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin'
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine

Where peeps touch nothing but style heat and cheddar
Compete with ya livelihood to eat better
And ain't nothing sweet but the ladies who speak wetta
With a torn smile, trying to get my song on file
It's on now, the whole town done gone wild
Kick rhymes off my heartbeat as a unborn child
Then developed a strong style on Long Isle
Won't be long now, I started rhyming young
I designed for fun, knowing my time would come
I started, paying dues DJ'in with crews
Learning the inner city rules, conveying the news
Soon as the jam start the man's art'll jam parks
Slam so hard it remains a landmark
The rhyme that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
But ""Rough enough to break New York from Long Island""

Like any G.O.D., loose on a spree for new degrees
Things to do and see until nothing is new to me
A true MC usually be into a breeze
And I can still see New York City through the trees
My advance slams put you outside looking in
Or the other way around, that depends, look again
Took a pen so you could zero in on my book of gems
It extends from the Hamptons to Brook-lyn
Through every hoodie in town, to learn the Boogie Down
Til every DJ around, wanted to put me down
Rhymes got rougher til I was ready to blast off
And harass all from Suffolk County to Nassau
Where we keep the money piling, keep the honies smiling
Keep the heater just in case kids start whyling

Where violence usually ends in sirens

We make cash on the street called straight path
We take class, build with the Gods with great math
Everyday true to the street, and never fronted
Along the way, learned from the best that ever done it
Being exposed to life's highs and lows
Got my flows ready for shows, I'm ready for the pros
I put it on a tape and then the city I tested
Then on the radio the are's requested
Now the whole world's whyling, all the girls smiling
You know, it's on, soon as they let the crowd in
The rhyme that I'm styling, smooth as a violin

Taunt cops with more props and we want not
Panhandling with your mans and them
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win
While the cops clock em, thieves flock em
Women watch em, traders wanna top em
Ay yo what's the problem
Before the narcs knock em opposite players plot to rob em
The ghetto got em, my man said it's rough at the bottom

Levantore!
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 til the next ball drop
All year around plus they shuffle non stop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be celly
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money
And earn money and watch the century turn 20

Levantore!
We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could,
But we fall cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life
Before a lot parish, we got to cherish if Allah let us
Let's give prop and merits till the block flourish
In this metropolis, stay on top of this
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous

Levantore!
Now we networking
Respect the next person, it'll be less hurting
Or left lurking, while we kept our dreads working
Connect set for certain, total networking
Last chance to advance and stash grands
If you have plans to have fam and mad land
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over

Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass

All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life

I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the God at come back smellin' like Cognac

Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet
But I take advantage and take you for granted

Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end

Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now

Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights

I know too much of any thing is bad whatever
Long as we have good and bad times together
Bad times make the good times that much better

Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life

You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you

And for the chill I will forever come real
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal

Keep the models following wise as King Solomon 
Come slow through the jungle like an animal

All the way to New Orleans and everything in between

Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven 
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven 
The silence's a set back make em regret that 
One way to get back is violence and wet cats 
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again 
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in 
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering 
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering

You ain't havin Ra so don't test the god 
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters

Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap 
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back 
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack 
So reload the van go ahead let em in 
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again 
surprise a town the place it's live and loud 
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd 
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around 
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down 
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali 
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali 
I'm worldwide my brothers be biggin' me up 
Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what 
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad 
Like Saddaam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad

You wore against your will. 
With lies of hope and glory, 
They taught you how to kill.

",We'll Never Stop,1999
Rakim,"Have you ever been stabbed in the back
By someone you thought was really cool
Did they steal your heart or was it money
Or was it lies they told
Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again ?cause now you know

That friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind
Never know what's on their mind
Could be true deception
Jealousy and envy reign
They never want to see you get ahead
They just hold you back

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend, oh, oh

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Friends are hard to find, so be careful
You could find an inch or mile if I pay you
But some ain't that bad, but one might back stab
To get the fake tips of what one might have
Bite the hand that feeds you, leave the people who need you
For those who hold you back and mislead you
To be a needle, don't get lead on unleaded
The wrong direction, a dead end's next then
Heed the detour, life's like a seesaw
The ups and downs, and I'll bet there'll be more
Potholes and obstacles in our path, that's righteous
At times you need a hand to fight this
Way of life, straighten up, take the door to the placid
And don't you act two-faced
?Cause jealousy and envy, and you still act friendly
You could find the end and pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, yeah

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Used to me kiss me, tell me you missed me
But now you try to glaze me, play me and diss me
Uh, wide awake, ready to break, so we argue
What happened to the kisses, and, ""Why, how are you?""
Forgot about the times when I rhymed when I bathed you
Dreams was the only little things that I gave you
You still ain't thankful, you're still complainin'
Used to be a quiet storm, but now it's rainin'
Farther than ever, I'm thinkin' whether
If we should be friends, let it end, is it better
To forget or remember, your body's tender
The rhymes that I send her, makes her surrender
The feeling of capture, caught in a rapture
No woman can match ya, so when I'm lookin' at ya
Paint a perfect picture so you can remember me
But you can find the end if you pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, oh, oh

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friends, yeah

Rakim,"Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano

Bring a bullet proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
Now what the trigger say

Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through

Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady
Say don't lose me

So reload quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin'
This fifi get wit' me

You steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me

Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But watch the God get

Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast

Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't thirty-eight
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate

Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' 'em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma

Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I

Reduced the friction
With crucifixion
Let loose the mix
Then boost the piston

Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that

I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm
Hit another M.C.

Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when

Music is louder
Full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of

Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss

But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines
That I have to hit

Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up

You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate
And nothing's equivalent

Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around
To rob with a army

You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em,
Soon as I inject 'em

With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in

Let it split 'em
Since he brought his main man wit' 'em
He ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass

Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance

The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here
Let me introduce you

Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy

Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a havoc

If ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention, follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose

Too many milligram
But what made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man

Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'em, he'll never forget 'em
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em

At least when he left he'll know what hit 'em
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, catch up, hell no

Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it

Perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'

Blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein, then remain, let it radiate

Vibes will vibrate, why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style break
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone

Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach your intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my write reflect

Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er

Regardless of the wait i'm gonna stay straight ghetto
Everybody high, don't nobody say hello
Even when the sunshining it ain't yellow
Get out of the borough
If you know it ain't thorough
Niggas play ball, AWOL, on the furlow
Still came down on the furl and pumped hero
Red and grey Macs
Keep it clean as Ajax
Ghettos sling cracks
While you niggas pay tax
Now how ghetto is this
you can catch me in your hallway taking a piss
One hand on my dick one hand on a spliff
Burnt lips from the roach clip, yellow tips
If we ain't closed it I get ferocious
Know this whole shit will leave me in them roaches
In your car motion I cause commotion
And i probably need some lotion
But i don't get fucked

Fake guards telling you pork
Settle for shorts
Running from court
New ports, criminal thoughts
On the blocks bodies acourt
Nobody supports

Stickers hate I never leave a bread to trace
Only evidence I leave is hickies on chicks' face
In the corner with the crooked niggas
But yo shit's straight
We start war to leave with these seven revolvers
Sell case never test the floor
Sticky yank slicking enough why'all
I'm a man enough to put on a dress
To creep up like grand-moma and bust why'all
Get close enough to part your vest and tux off

Too smart to get caught
But I got fam up north
So if they put me in coughs

For the venom in my python spit

You hoes used to plan a gross
With the hands toast
Close and stand opposed
Rubber bands she knows
Grams of the coke
Razor blade tuck the side the line
The banter of the coke
Watching niggas die with my hand on their doe
Singing with the bass
And wash up the ?land? when they float
Choking on your own words
Should have watched the ground when you spoke
One last final approach
Make your whole family ghost
Bust bottles of cham and and we toast
Till your photo stamped in the post

The arm in that, you show me where the party's at
Seminars and tracks, hors, comas, and cardiacs
Broads and cats screaming ""Oh my God he's back""

A thousand styles in one verse, rhythms will switch patterns

Known to spit a magnum, or split an atom
Who woulda known that Jesus would come back to the ghetto
On that level, and that thorough, like a black hero

The pharaoh of five boroughs, and take over the rap world

And convicts, killers and dons
Drug dealers, playas and pimps, smooth talkers
Stick up kids, thugs, real niggas and gods

I was moving them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners

You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous

Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon
As you hear it  pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Detects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme
I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you want to get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Thinkin of a master plan

'cause ain't nuthin but sweat inside my hand

So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent

So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint

So I start my mission- leave my residence

Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents

I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid

So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin funny

Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin move but the money

But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous

I feel great! so maybe I might just

Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive

Then maybe I'll stay alive

So I walk up the street whistlin this

Feelin out of place 'cause, man, do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of

Me and Eric be	, and a nice big plate of

Fish, which is my favorite dish

But without no money it's still a wish

'cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid

So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made

To now test to see if I got pull

Te hare sudar toda la noche 
Asi que no digas que no (x2)

Dejame Tocarte 
Quiero desnudarte
Conmigo vas a volar
Yo te voy hacer ver soÃ±ar
Se que te vas enchular
Why vas a querer una noche mas 

Por que estoy perdido, un poco confundido
Cuando yo te veo, altera mi sentidos
Yo voy a pillarte, quiero yo agarrarte
No hay escapatoria, voy acorralarte

Nena yo por tenerte daria lo que no fuera 
Por abrazarte why perderme en tus caderas 
Por esos ojos que me dicen que deseas como yo
Es que sin ti yo me siento un poco perdido
No aguanto las ganas de tenerte conmigo 
Te hare sudar toda la noche 
Asi que no digas que no (x2)

Rakim,"Follow me into a solo,  get in the flow
And you could picture, like a photo
Music makes mellow, maintains to make
Melodies for MCs, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting; I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it now it's a daily word
I can get illin' at normal killin'
Bambino along, Rakim'll remain calm
Self esteem make me super superb and supreme
Before a microphone, still, I fiend
This was a take, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see 'em keep followin' and swallowin'
Takin' the makin', bitin' and borrowin'
Brothers try and others die to get the formula
But I'm a let 'cha sweat.  You still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posin'
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me, and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel adventitious at speeds around the universe
What could you say as the earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay?
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
As far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare into the darkness, your knowledge: took!
So keep starin', soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the ""R""
This is a lesson.  If you're guessin' and if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'
The Leader
 
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""
Keep Followin'
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""

This is a lifetime mission
Vision a prison.  All right, listen
In this journey, you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you movin' 'cause the crowd said so
Dance!  Cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades, bleedin' death.  Call an ambulance!
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murderin' MCs
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
""Follow the Leader!""  ...Yeah, dope!
'Cause every time I stop, you see, just duck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin' and provin' and lettin' knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever.  You disagree?
You say, ""Never?""  Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
Called by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I had to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we were put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
Again, somebody told you, a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed with a
Switch.  Here's a lesson if you're guessin', if you're borrowin'
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin'
The Leader
 
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader!""

A fear if I freestyle lyrics-a-fury
My third eye make me shine like jury
You're just a rented rapper, you're rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when they fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every trade of my snake so stay awake
And follow and follow 'cause the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to Daddy...  Indeed!
The ""R's"" a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directs the tone then rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin'!  A brother said, ""Dig him?""  I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
It's a danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, to space it, grace it, change the tone
There's one ""R"" in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B., be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state.  Follow us.  Tailgate
Keep comin', but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up your group, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant.  Clap your hands.  You won a trip
The price is right.  Don't make a deal too soon
How many notes?  Could you name this tune?
""Follow the Leader"" is a title they task
Now you know; you don't have to ask
Rappers' rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might get junked if you follow the records he wrecks
Until then, keep eatin' and swallowin'
You better take a deep breath and keep followin'
The Leader
 
Follow the leader.

Rakim,"Once again back it's the incredible"" 
Yeah, yeah 
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist 
Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this 
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this 
Mastered this, flash this and make em clap to this 
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd 
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud 
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it 
But me and the microphone is still magnetic 
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock 
Dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot 
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars 
Massage at the bar smokin ten dollar cigars 
while I admire ?, with more vision than TV's 
I find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties 
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin track 
Rockin jams by popular demand, I'm back 
[Chorus]

I control the crowd, you know I hold it down 
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound 
From town to town, until it's world reknowned 
And I rock New York City all year around 

Check it out 
It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs 
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs 
Equations are drawn up in paisley form 
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian 
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style 
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal 
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer 
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China 
Split the mic open fill it with somethin potent to go in 
And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin 
Hot science is smokin altitudes cause chokin 
Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin 
Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines 
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend 
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin 
I'ma move crowds to 2000 

[Chorus]

Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance 
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos 
My plan is ?, the diagram know where the damage 
I take advantage, until your crowd go bananas 
What a rush I hear cuts and I lust to touch 
Microphones get clutches by the illustrious 
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid 
Born with three 7's in my head 
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this 
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists 
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges 
With knowledge and scholarships, when Ra be droppin this 
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible 
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo 
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes 
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic 

[Chorus]

""Once again, back it's the incredible"" 
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, ya know what I mean? 
""Rakim Allah"" 
Till death do us part 
""Once again, back it's the incredible"" 
It's on 
""Rakim Allah""

Rakim,"I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good looking, is this seat tooken
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your hostile, 'itty attitude wit a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot
Is it because your sign don't talk a lot
She turned away, no play, I said ok
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familar scene
I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See i don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hm, I didn't want to play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said hi
Curiosity- at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
i said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find,
I want to know what's on your mind

CHORUS
About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello""
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't want to stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I want to get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ectacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find...

I want to know what's on your mind
I want to know what's on your mind

Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound

Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to the her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing ; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me,
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...",What's on Your Mind,2005

And together, we can get

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
So I start my mission- leave my residence

Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money

But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great! so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this

Feelin' out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric be	, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish

Acariciando la noticia de que tú no volverás
Desorienta'o, dando vueltas en mi cama
Pensando si me amas, yo que te he ama'o
Como nadie, como loco, amores como el mío pocos hay
Duermo solea'o, rocha'o porque te has marcha'o

En la misma cama en donde te ame

Acariciando la noticia de no tenerla a usted
Entiéndanme, los hombres también lloran
Y más cuando se va la persona que mas adoran
Estoy en baja, down, ya no tengo ni palabras
Pensando en ti, dando vueltas en la cama
No es fácil vivir la agonía
De pensar en ti noche, mañana, y día
Estoy muriendo, sufriendo, yo te hago entender

Pero todo fallo en todos los intentos

[Chorus]
Ay I'm focused now, they notice now
Shorty to ride with me you got to hold this down
But you ain't got to worry cause we run this town
A nigga run up on me will get his ass gunned down
(You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill
You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill
You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill
You know for reals, the only way that I can chill)

Uh, niggas won't understand 'til they man fall
From a exit wound big as a handball, damn y'all
Can a nigga spend a mill for a house on the hill as tall as a Ferris wheel?
Niggas better chill, for the Barretta peel
Knock off your head and ill, whole bunch of red'll spill
Nigga I'm rollin' up, system blowin', hater's glowin' up, frozen up
Range Rover truck color Coconut
I used to be broke ass fuck, 'til I woke 'em up
I'll show you how to stroke a slut, get in her throat and gut
Then it's back to postin' up, wheels pokin' out
Smoke about enough to have you gaspin' and chokin' out
I - do what I wanna when I wanna ball when it's summer
Leave out the club, squeeze 'em all in the Hummer
Stitching in the seats, interior Peanut Butter
Brand new Pelle Pelle, Nine-millimeter under

[Chorus]

Uh, Banks is back yeah the punchline boy
You've got to be a millionaire to touch my toy
I figured, I'll let the haters see it one more time
I skeet off zero to sixty in three-point-nine
Besides, I gotta make the jewelery store on time
I look like I bought the jewelery store this time
And it's hard to live like a Rap Star on the cover
I got three Magnums, the gun, car, and the rubber
I got a fur fetish, a three-quarter cut habit

Part rabbit, go find your heart faggot
I prey niggas find your foot and toe tag it
There ain't never a drought, I got the sour on tour
So raw I gotta hotel towel on the door
Hoes all around the hotel pilled to the floor
They done followed your boss since two-thousand and four

From here on out it's manslaughter for the masses
And classics courtesy of Mr. Mathers
You bastards heard of me I get the cash
It's the American way I go to bed with the 'K
I got red, blue and white don't even ask about ice
I look like a cop car flashin' his lights
All he want to do is chit chat and make tapes about him
'Til they lost like Malcolm before the ""Nation"" got him
Out in timbaland tearing the coup, my wrist chunky like Campbells soup
Niggas shoot, I done been around the world
And I'm right here you won't hurt me
I'll put your ass on ice yeah, cold turkey
I'm blowin' Purple, the Haze mixed with Hershey

Rakim,"Don't sweat the Technique
Don't sweat the Technique

Let's trace the hints and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul.
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass,'till MC's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep,
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
Wit a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

Don't Sweat the Technique

They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but
Researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to last who observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
 
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

But don't sweat the Technique

I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something  brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never  irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Don't sweat the Technique 
Don't sweat the Technique",Don't Sweat the Technique,2008
Rakim,"It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smokin ten dollar cigars
While I admire midas, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin track
Rockin jams by popular demand, I'm back

[Chorus]
I control the crowd, you know I hold it down
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world reknowned
And I rock New York City all year around
It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with somethin potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin
Hot science is smokin altitudes cause chokin
Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin
Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
I'ma move crowds to 2000

[Chorus]
Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam
I take advantage, until the crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts then I lust to touch
Microphones get clutched by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologist's, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic",Guess Who's Back?,2008
Rakim,"Me and Eric be	 was coolin' at the Paladium
Seen a all-world covered girl, I said ""Hey lady I'm 
Sorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up
Or interveen or interrupt, but
You got the look - I want to get to know ya better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didn't sweat her
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European.
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory -
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric be	""
Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk,
So we could talk and see New York.
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't want to stop
Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain
Each mic is a mineral, poetry's protein
Verse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine
So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal 
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said

Chorus:

Over Me, She's goin' crazy
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony . . .


Verse Two:

So I prescribed her, something to revive
And surprise her, she's liver and much more wiser
Than the light I shine when my brain cells spark,
Come to me so we can glow in the dark
And soon, you can represent the moon
As long as I keep ya in tune
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go
fuck around and miss the show
So I told her to hold that thought real tight
We can finish where we left off later on tonite
Back to the scene of the crime on time
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme'
She stood with a birds-eye view of me
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon
As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row
So I said ""let's go"" 
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore
Besides I got places to go, ladies to see
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said,
""I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
Looks I received made it hard to MC
I can take a hint, so I knew that she
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-why"" in her bod-why
Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm So
She asked how come I don't smile
I said, ""Everything's fine, but I'm in a New York state of mind!""
As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some
Sentimental, songs real gentle, 
It hit the spot and you know where it went to
As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin'
I knew she was in the mood for somethin'
So I laid on my back and relaxed
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe
Over me

There is no God but you
There is no God but you
Praised be the Lord

For those who find it hard to believe, and it is
Why they call me the God MC the lyricist
Trace this down to the roots from Genesis
The world wonder, I'm still standing like pyramids
Design so vivid, every brick it got a story to tell
My rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic
Mind prolific, infinite, like mathematic
The first language, now add that and add graphics
Then go let the blocks know it's the gospel
Life's new manual so watch close
The new Michelangelo and Pablo Picasso
Prepared to show you the cosmos and rock flows
Even my lyrical metaphysical
What this'll do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle
You find your mind too far-fetched for it to fathom
I bring the darkness to the light, split the atom
It's like watching the big bang theory emerge
I take titles, bond them to reveal new words
They want a clear view
From the farthest and the darkest corners of the universe
To a corner near you
A pharaoh in ghetto apparel, stay blinged up
Fort Knox display, a modern day King Tut
Wrapped tight, rap like I've been preserved in time
Spit the holy water, then touch it and turn it to wine
It's the God

Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you
There is no God but you
Praised be the Lord

We were children of the most high, so we fell
From paradise to holy hell
Probably descendants of the Holy Grail
Another part of history they won't reveal
Times'll only tell
You waiting for Judgment? It came
In the form of a thug in the game
To create a strong position, there's blood in my vein
The chemical is identical, we one and the same
With seven letters in all three of my government names
Walk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus
It's a parable to make followers and readers believers
From Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left
Understand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F
I told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets
Jesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad
I showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise
I spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus
Like Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal
The seven spirits of God when I open the seal
Interpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you
Translate the Torah, and decode the Bible
Warn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law
The seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance
Skin is bronze like the Messiah
Rakim Allah's about to reveal the biggest secret in time: Men are God

Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you
There is no God but you

He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
Cuz he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me want to put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

I'm from the hood that's forever sinning
Where life is took for granted here so death is winning
Nothing but blues around, feels like we're losing out
Times that spent in this environment confuse a child
As a juvenile I ran wild I ran out of blessings
Been in and out of prison as an adolescent
My goal was getting it, til something said to turn my life around
Redirect my hustle, and go legitimate
Til I get corporate and invest fortunes
With exec bosses sitting behind a desk at the office
I'm left jobless, nobody hiring ex-convicts
That don't mean I'm less conscious
It's so hard when they close doors
And when you looking like a so-called hip hoppa you get nada
Stereotyped, scarred for life stigmata
But still a kid's gotta get a dolla

Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

I tackle choices every day that's hopeless
I hear a voice saying ""stay focused""
Fast money, cars, and broads will mislead you
Love backwards here is evol but it's legal
Multi-task I make a fortune faster
Keep rhymin til I'm climbing up the corporate ladder
In my community, you've gotta go out of your way if you're out to get paid
Than back up and wait for opportunity
I try not to blame society
I eat my pride cuz I know deep inside it's me
But not entirely, when a man try to live righteously
And propriety turn to anxiety
I thought I paid back the system when I stayed in prison
Left the stripes, see what success is like
But the way they set the price
You spent your childhood in the wild hood
You're in debt for life

Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good

I figured out what was talking with me
When I do right I feel him walking with me
So I'm adamant, some call it arrogance
I can cope it cuz I know I'm broke for having sense
But my back's against the wall, it's getting rough to get a buck
In a job with a minimum wage won't get enough
Faced with giving up, and my lady friend's beefing
Ends ain't meeting, we just an argument away from splitting up
It gets lonely, my fam disowned me
Called me the black sheep cuz I act street
Yeah it's that deep, I tried to change clicks
Homies flipped on me cuz I don't hang, we have beef
But I'm at peace so that cease, at least
I ain't got no ties on my Porsche ride
And no time for no crime, knowing that the most high
Is watching with a close eye

But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Funky...
",Eric B is President,2010
Rakim,"Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano

Bring a bullet proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
Now what the trigger say

Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through

Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady
Say don't lose me

So reload quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin'
This fifi get wit' me

You steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me

Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But watch the God get

Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast

Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't thirty-eight
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate

Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' 'em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma

Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I

Reduced the friction
With crucifixion
Let loose the mix
Then boost the piston

Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that

I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm
Hit another M.C.

Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when

Music is louder
Full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of

Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss

But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines
That I have to hit

Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up

You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate
And nothing's equivalent

Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around
To rob with a army

You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em,
Soon as I inject 'em

With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in

Let it split 'em
Since he brought his main man wit' 'em
He ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass

Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance

The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here
Let me introduce you

Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy

Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a havoc

If ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention, follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose

Too many milligram
But what made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man

Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'em, he'll never forget 'em
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em

At least when he left he'll know what hit 'em
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, catch up, hell no

Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it

Perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'

Blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein, then remain, let it radiate

Vibes will vibrate, why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style break
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone

Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach your intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my write reflect

Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy
Talk team, they take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me
Smoke scream, we're going in flames
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be
Say it's time for things to change
We arrange that dope product we built cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio
You record companies kill me
Try to force me to strain it, no way
They got the gall to say ""yo, how real can real be?""
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name
Media, the game, to me your all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger

Und jedesmal wenn ich dem Kind die Windeln bind'
Dann macht es:

Denn beide sind so mollig

Ralf Zdiarstek,"Oh, I dare not to sleep anymore
'Cause I see her face in every nightmare
In all the windows of my haunted house
And when I dream a dream of flowers
I wake up in my hand a bloody rose

'Blood shall come upon you'
So she spoke to me
Never knew she'd come back
Now she's on my dreams

From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream

They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream
Or just a wicked memory ... Oh

Now I see her coming on her besom...
The smell of brimstone
And the mark of the beast
From the open window
Is it just a dream
As she's pulling out the dagger to stab
A thousand times into my hurting breast

Wake up from the nightmare
Screaming when I see her stand
with the face of Jakob
A bloody dagger in her hand

From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream

Maybe his conscience
Will send him a dream in his dreams
If I only knew - oh Anna -
If his soul also came free
Or maybe if Jakob
Would talk to the bailiff for you
I can't come for you

I don't know how many souls were set free
To start a rebellion, don't know if I'll still have to flee

Oh that faces in my dream...
From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory...",Memory,2002

This might be our last goodbye
Our country calls you to defend a great land
So do your part just like a man

Down where the river bends
With God's help we'll meet again
Under the same old sycamore tree
Proud of each other and the land of the free

I go down to the ocean blue
Its just as close as I came to you
This old ocean might keep us apart
But it won't keep you dear out of my heart

Over your far distant, lonely grave

No matter what you may do

Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you

Each night in my dreams
When I awake you're not there
Come back to me
And let's start life anew
Losing you's so hard to bear

You drifted away
From the happiness
That might have been
I vision the time
Some day you'd be mine
And treasure the love
I can't win

Ralph Blane,"Love can be a moment's madness
Love can be insane
Love can be a life of sadness and pain

Love can be a summer shower
Love can be the sun
Love can be two hearts that flower as one

It can be, fine and free
But that kind
Is not so very easy to find

Love can be a dying ember
Love can be a flame
Love pledged in September
May be dead in December
You may not even remember it came

Love can be a joy forever
Or an empty name
Love is almost never ever the same

Love can be an evil-doer
Love can be a fog
Love can make you feel like you were a dog

Love can be a snow-capped mountain
Love can be the truth
Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure
Love can bring you fame
Love fresh as the morning
May be wild when it's 'borning
And then without any warning, it's tame

Oh love can be a sweet endeavor
Or a dirty shame
Love is almost never ever, the same!",Love,1994
Ralph Blane,"A medicine man I met 
Said don't get yourself in a sweat. 
When things look gray, 
Just shrug and say: 
""it musta been somethin' I et!"" 
""so don't get yourself in a snit, "" he said, 
""tuck your tantrums into your kit instead. 
""it's disarming to be charming,"" 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than. 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do. 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do. 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint. 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war 
Paint. 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury. 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do. 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do. 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'n' Chicopees, too. 
Pull your ears in, try to use a little control. 
When ""all clear""'s in, you'll be top man on the totem 
Pole. 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 

Like those Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas 
And those Chickadees, Cherokees, 
Chapultepecs 
And those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'n' Chicopees, Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanoogas, Cheekarohs do-o-o-o",Pass That Peace Pipe,1994
Ralph Blane,"With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes
And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley
And lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten 
Then I counted to ten again

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to leave
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1997

I hear the sad howling of coyotes prowling
It sounds so mournful to me
It brings back memories of cherished loved ones
Of ones I'm longing to see

   I'm riding away out on the lone prairie
   The rangers are searching for me
   I'm riding away from my home in Texas
   A fugitive ever to be

I had a good mother I had a good father
They handed a warning to me
The men that I ran with committed a murder
And laid the blame on me

Little Maggie my sweetheart I know she's lonely
And longs for me to return
My happiness ended the night we parted
And now for her I yearn

How lonely how dreary with nothing to cheer me

My life of sadness will never know gladness
I'm branded forever to roam

Ralph Brown,"I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Tryin' to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on channel 1-9!
 When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line

And he said: ""Breaker 1-9! Is anyone there?
 ome on back, truckers and talk to Teddy Bear!""
Well, I keyed the mike and said: ""You got it, Teddy Bear!""
 And a little boy's voice came back on the air

""'Preciate the break,  Who we got on that end?""
   I told him my handle, and, then he began:
""Now, I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
   Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air

But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
   'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled, and, I can't walk!""
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
   And I'd talk to him, as long as he liked

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
   ""But I guess it's mine and mom's now, 'cause my daddy's dead!""
""Dad had a wreck about a month ago
   He was trying to get home in a blindin' snow

Mom has to work now, to make ends meet
   And I'm not much help, with my two crippled feet!""
""She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
   But, I hear her crying, sometimes late at night

You know there's just one thing I want more than anything else to see
   Aw, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me!""
""But, you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
   But, I guess that's all over now, since my daddy's gone

Not one breaker came on the old CB
   As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump that just wouldn't stay down
   As I thought about my boy back in Greenville Town

""Dad was going to take mom and me with him later on this year, Why,
   l remember 'I'm saying: 'Someday this old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear!'
But, I know I'll never get to ride an 18-wheeler again
   But, this old base will keep me in touch with all my trucker friends!""

""Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
   'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But, you give me a shout when you're passin' through
   And I'll sure be happy to come back to you!""

Well, I came back and I said: uh! ""Before you go 10-10
   What's your home 20, little CB friend?""
Well, he gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
   'Cause this hot load of freight was just gonna have to wait

I turned that truck around on a dime
   And headed straight for Jackson Street, 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one heck of a shock
   late wheelers were lined up for three city blocks!

Why, I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
   And that little crippled boy was having a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
   Another would carry him to his truck and take off again

Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear
   And then I carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
   I want you to know I saw it that day, in the face of that little man

We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
   And each driver said goodbye and then they all were gone
He shook my hand with a mile-long grin
   And said: ""So long, trucker I'll catch ya again!""

Well, I hit the Interstate with tears in my eyes
   I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
""Breaker 1-9!"" Came a voice on the air
   ""Just one word of thanks from Mama Teddy Bear!""

""We wish each and every one, a special prayer for you
   'Cause, You just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now, before, I start to cry
   May God ride with you, 10-4, and goodbye.""",Teddy Bear,2009

She'd be unhappy without me I know

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure

Ralph Burns Orchestra,"A medicine man I met 
Said don't get yourself in a sweat. 
When things look gray, 
Just shrug and say: 
""it musta been somethin' I et!"" 
""so don't get yourself in a snit, "" he said, 
""tuck your tantrums into your kit instead. 
""it's disarming to be charming,"" 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than. 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do. 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do. 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint. 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war 
Paint. 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury. 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do. 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do. 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'n' Chicopees, too. 
Pull your ears in, try to use a little control. 
When ""all clear""'s in, you'll be top man on the totem 
Pole. 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 

Like those Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas 
And those Chickadees, Cherokees,

The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.

None other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet that the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own

Ralph Carmichael Orchestra & Chorus,"It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
comes round the age of gold
when peace shall over all the earth
it's ancient slpendors fling
and our whole world give back the song
which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1967

While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains

And makes the nations prove

Ralph Carmichael Orchestra & Chorus,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross,1967
Ralph Carmichael Orchestra & Chorus,"Throw out the life line across the dark wave;
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! O who then will dare
To throw out the life line, his peril to share?

Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong:
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today
And out with the life boat! away, then away!

Throw out the life line to danger fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you've never been;
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore;
Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,
But throw out the life line and save them today.

This is the life line, oh, tempest tossed men;
Baffled by waves of temptation and sin;
Wild winds of passion, your strength cannot brave,
But Jesus is mighty, and Jesus can save.

Jesus is able! To you who are driv'n,
Farther and farther from God and from Heav'n;
Helpless and hopeless, o'erwhelmed by the wave;
We throw out the life line, 'tis 'Jesus can save.'

This is the life line, oh, grasp it today!
See, you are recklessly drifting away;
Voices in warning, shout over the wave,
O grasp the strong life line, for Jesus can save.",Throw Out the Lifeline,1967

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

When I love you so

Which way shall I turn
Well, I'd sure like to know

Are what you will put me through

The rides they is scarce as the rain
When you're down to your last shuck with nothing to sell
And too far away from the train
Been a good month of Sunday's and a guitar ago
I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends, some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

Locked horns with the devil himself

And a hobo with stars in his crown",Ride Me Down Easy,2001

And a perfume that whispers ""Please comes back to me""

I'm looking for something in white

I'm looking for something in blue

Don't tell me that's just what old married folk do

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Ralph Lalama,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1996
Ralph Lalama,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

Ralph Lalama Quartet,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1993
Ralph Lalama Quartet,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing

Ralph Lalama Quartet,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2008

Just another way to break your heart.
And it really makes you wonder what became of love.
In the name of love.

Ralph McTell,"And once I walked a million miles
All the way to Yugoslavia
And I carried you all of the way
For where I was then there you are.

As the sun rose o'er the curb stones
By the road where I'd been sleeping
Them night-long trucks, as they roared by
They could not drown my weeping.

And it was me, and I alone
Who looked toward the far horizon
And I saw King Heron
On his dead tree throne
And I knew not which to keep my mind on.

Now I cannot speak for everyone
For they got their reasons
All on this road
But, Heron, would that I had your wings
For then I'd know where I would go
For then I'd know where I would go.

And I'm leaving like a thief in the night.
But I will try to write to you, or maybe phone
And I'll send you back the money,
But not the love you lent
I could never pay no interest on that loan

And I want to get out now 'cause I need just a couple of drinks.
Can you lend me a little money till pay day next?

Who scattered the stars in the field of night?

With waves of no direction
With compass set up on a star
Head for the port's protection.

Faster than light we're not ageing,
So where does the time go we're saving?
Give me a sermon for sleep tonight
Won't you say it's all right, say it's all right,
Well say it's all right.

And the driftwood it collides
With blind boats on the water
Oh, sad I watched the moon fall down,
But the river safely caught her.

Confusion of stars where's the pattern
To chart us away from collision?
We are dust, we are spark, we were light before dark
It was all right, it is all right,
And it'll be all right.

Above, below, worlds collide
In the before and after
Oh happy to watch the sun go down
And join the angels' laughter.



",Lunar Lullaby,1975
Ralph McTell,"Pity the boy who marries for money
Or wealth and position
Thinking his troubles will fade out of mind.
Pity the boy who marries for beauty
Only to find like a flower in the morning it withers and dies.

Better by far to marry for love,
Stay broke for the rest of your days
Than to settle down for the sake of
Ending your rambling ways
And they won't end
And thinking about them
Your time you will spend.

Pity the girl who marries for duty
Believing in time if she works at her heart
It will turn into love.
Pity the girl who marries for strength
And protection, she'll find
In the shade of a great tree nothing can grow.

Better by far to marry for love
And stay broke for the rest of your days
Than to settle down for the sake of
Ending the games you have played
They won't end
And thinking about them
Your time you will spend.

Bless the child that's born of a union
Grown out of love
He's richer by far, he's got more than enough
Bless the child who walks in that union
Grows in that love
His riches are more than the stars under heaven.




",Pity the Boy,1975

And I think that it might
If not relieve all the pain that I feel
At least help me to sleep tonight.

Come down like an angel
Come on down like a woman
Say that it's forgiven.
Give me your sweet forgiveness,
Sweet forgiveness
And it must be,
Must be the seeds of heaven.

When I'm weak and feeling guilty
And it's sometimes I do,
Give me strength to seek forgiveness
Come and help me to see it through.

You can do what you want and I don't mind.

Don't much care for birds of paradise
Rather have a sparrow
Don't like flying much either now
Things you can't control.

But you make me feel good
You with your scruffy jeans and your run-down shoes
You make me feel good
You only do the things that you want to.

And maybe tomorrow if the wheels can roll
We can take the road down south, babe,
Get to Mexico.

I don't wanna hear any sad stories

I bought her a drink and we made an agreement
""Don't tell me your sad story and I won't tell you mine.""

Kids wear no shoes, dusty streets full of dreams
Aim for the dance floor and maybe they'll play a slow tune

Oh Tequila sunset, Tijuana sunrise

And maybe tomorrow the wheels can roll
We can take the road down south babe
Get to Mexico
We will take the road down south,

When the break is mended it can be stronger than before.
Don't go round butting doors or punching walls.

Ralph McTell,"In my country garden, underneath the mountain
With dead-nettles growing all around the door
Early every morning the sun comes up the mountain
Setting in the sea in the evening once more.

Take some water from the brook
Wondering who it was that took the stones from the mountain to build the cottage here
Two up and two down, miles from the nearest town
I wonder who it was but the reason why is clear

Take a bunch of nettles, add a little water
Drawn from the stream running outside the door
Leave it for a month or two, bottle it and drink the brew
Watch the suns go down in the sea once more.

Take some wood to build a fire
Could you really get much higher than standing in the doorway with a glass of nettle wine
My lady beside me, the mountain behind me
Before me the sea and the red skyline.",Nettle Wine,1977
Ralph McTell,"I stopped a man the other night
Saying isn't a beautiful sky
And although he agreed it was just to please me
I could tell that by the look in his eye

And his look got bolder looking over his shoulder
At me as he quickened his step
So I didn't take his hand as I had planned
I threw a stone instead.

And went la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
There's a house I know where roses grow
I was there the other day.

And I seen this chick coming down the road
She was coming my way
So I picked a rose and stuck it under her nose
She said, ""What about my hay fever"".

Then this man came out and he started to shout
He wasn't very happy either.
La, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,

A little while ago one Saturday night
I was happy and drunk as could be.
A policewoman come up and she said 
That night the cells would sober me

I said I ain't be in bars I got drunk on the stars
You can't pin nothing on me
Then she smiled and I said ""Oh, kiss me instead"".
She said ""I can't I'm on duty"".

La, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
I was in the park, it was just before dark
And there grows a tree of mine.

And I see this girl she was walking her dog
Around the football pitch line.
I said ""You see this tree well it belongs to me
I'd like to give it to you"".

And then she said ""Cheers although it's been mine for years
It was a very nice thing to do"".

Ralph McTell,"The lights have gone dim, and the people are gone.
And clown goes back into his caravan.
Hangs up his smile on a hook by the door
And lets his ragged coat slip to the floor.
With the sound of the children's laughter
Still ringing in his ears.
Laughing 'cause they're happy,
They laugh to hide their fears.
Clown loves the children
For, like him, they fear.
The world does not exist tonight,
And only the circus,
Only the circus is real.
As real as the elephants that trumpet in the ring.
Real like the trapeze, see it swing.
Real like the man who eats real fire,

Real like the lady on the high wire.
But the people have gone, his identity gone.
Clown peeps through he window of his caravan.
From the trees on the common
The town looks so small.
Clown puts on his coat and goes out the door.
And the distant neon lights
They shine above the town.
""It's almost like a circus"", thinks clown.

And half with delight,
Shivering, shaking.

Ralph McTell,"She comes riding early in the morning,
About four to seven.
No one's ever out at that hour.
With eyes that see her
Touch the morning flowers secretly.
And the leaves slow their comotion,
And the great trees gently sway,
Like an ocean on a still day,
And raise, in praise, their arms to the sun.
Who announces the day has begun,
At eight frames a second.
Velvety shadows in misty meadows

Are changing colours so softly.
With care, the sun puts colour in his drawing,
And rises to inspect his masterpiece this morning,
So perfect.
And as she rides the gold and silver miles,
Only the sun is sure,
What it is that she smiles for.
She leaves with no sign of what she has done.
Though her morning rise, known by everyone;
I'll tell you her name, and it's Dawn.",Eight Frames a Second,1992
Ralph McTell,"Night stirs her inky finger in the water of the day,
The tired sun drops slowly in the sky.
And everywhere the gentle air hangs heavy with the day song
Evening calls the lamplight out to come 

Children's wooden hoops go clattering down the street
Soon they're called inside, it's getting late.
The grand canal 
Now splashed with red 

Reflects on swallows wings.
The lamplighter knows the song the evening sings.
But the gas-lamps stand like soldiers
Hiss warnings to the wind

Their evening vespers prophicy a war.
The world divides 
And men take sides
The spark bursts into flame

Nothing can be quite the same again.
Dog barks in the distance
Child cries in her sleep
Night waits for the dawn with baited breath.

The old school, the old rule
Rung out on a muffinman's bell
The lamplighter has made his nightly call.
Dreams of hope and peace

Sent clattering down the streets
Empty like the promises they made.
The wars rage on, and different wrongs
Will someone please explain

That peace is not the lamplighter 
'Cause he's not coming back again",England 1914,1992
Ralph McTell,"Standing alone in the fairground at night
The world racing past on the streets
Only the stars and the highlights of cars
Light the fantasy world while it sleeps
And I looked around but there wasn't a sound
But the cinders under my feet
Candy-floss sticks spelt words on the ground
I tried to read them in vain.
Before it was clear the wind blew my hair
And re-phrased the sentence again.
I stopped to light my last cigarette
The fair was lit up in its glow
I threw it away but the light seemed to stay
Like 'twere moonlight shining on snow.
And I hardly dare breathe
I just couldn't believe
Then the music started to flow.

Slowly everything started to move
'Cept me and I stood quite still.
Then came a soft cry near the coconut shy
Will you take to ride on the wind.
And around and around the big wheel when spinning
Round and around until
I noticed although the fairground was moving
The rest of the world stopped still.
It was then that I realised that I'd have to get off
Although I would've much rather stayed.
Then with a jolt the wheel came to a halt
And the music started to fade.
As the lights went dim my head started to spin
Told myself that I wasn't to blame.
Looked at the ground at the candy-floss sticks
Now the message was plain
Behind me the wheel and the fairground were still
And outside it was moving again.",The Fairground,1992
Ralph McTell,"Hey little girl on the bicycle, wheels spin like they're riding on air.
Hey little girl on the bicycle, wheels flash like the sun in her hair.
And the wheels go round but the bike has stopped moving
Trees on the river move by her.
Hey little girl on the bicycle, sun blaze in her hair like a flame,
And the river's reflecting her bicycle, and the reeds whisper her name,
And the wheels go round but the bike has stopped moving,

Hazy lazy,

Admiring all the flowers, 
Wandering round for hours.

Scented blended 
He saw her linger 
And With her finger open up a rose, 
Standing on tip toes
Suddenly the rain came flurrying, 
Sending the two of them scurrying, 

Helter skelter for the shelter 
And feeling bolder in the big pagoda, 
He gently enquired her name, 
And they waited till the sunshine came.

Smoke rising to the ceiling
The words just seem to float on by
Maybe you've had the feeling
Then looking into my empty glass
I noticed the bar clock was ten minutes fast
My beer was gone, and my money's spent,
And I think it's about time that I went.
I went walking along the main road
How can they call it High Street?
I said ""Hello"" to a face I know
But he had someone to meet.
Then I noticed that the sea was coming in
I almost felt like taking a swim,
But the sea gets wild so I've been told
And anyway it was much too cold.
I buttoned my coat up to my chin
Went walking along the sand
I thought I heard the mermaid sing
To the sound of a big brass band.
A seagull offered me a ride
And so as not to hurt his pride

I said I wasn't going far 
And I let him carry my guitar.
Then along come a mermaid, said ""Come sing me a song,
And I'll stop the band from playing"".
I was pleased and played with ease
To the mermaids gentle swaying.
I must've stayed there for an hour or two
The seagull said he'd have to go
And the mermaid said that she'd rather hear more
But she left me standing on the shore.
The sun was bathing in the sea
Right on the water line.
I shouted ""Goodbye"", but he didn't reply
I know he had no time.
Even my footprints had disappeared
And as for the road I steered 
Out from the sea there come a sigh
I think my mermaid said ""Goodbye"".

Ralph McTell,"Out in the garden, amongst the bushes, Michael is crying.
Caught in a spider's web, its broken wings beating, a butterfly dying.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
Well they must be blind, if they can't see what Michael sees.

Michael where are you ?
Michael where are we,
We who see that there's something wrong with your mind?

And inside the garden Michael is smiling, at peace in his world.
At one with the insects, the flowers, and the trees, and the wind and the birds.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Oh Michael sees all
Behind the high walls
Surrounding his kingdom,
Whilst we in our wisdom
Still trapped in the spider's web
Far from the flow and ebb
Of life in the garden
But Michael has pardoned
Us for he sees
That really he's free
And there's nothing to mend
For his wings are not broken

And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
They've seen the signs, but Michael feels fine inside the garden.

To keep us safe from dark, right through to day begun,
And we used to lie awake, just to try to see one,
And though we never saw one anywhere,
We heard them softly singing in the air.
Sundays occasionally we were invited back for tea,
And bread with jam and cream, made Sundays seem a dream.
In the dingy mission hall, Mrs Adlam praying,

And down the street back home, all our mates were playing,
With Mrs Adlam's angels everywhere,
And we thought we saw a halo in her hair.
Sundays, for sure, ain't like that anymore,
Its getting hard for me, to see her face in front of me.
I wonder if her angels have their arms around her curled,
Keeping her safe from life, and guarding her from the world.

And for a while I had a gap too
But it closed when my big teeth came through.

And that would make us smile too, as often as not
Did you have a friend who was a soldier?
Well I'm gonna join the army when I'm older.

Well I know you paid a fiver for that old motorbike
And they said it wouldn't run, but I thought that it might.
I was nearly asleep when it spluttered into life
And I clenched my fist and smiled a secret smile of delight
Was your first name Kevin or Mike?

I remember when you built us a soap-box cart
With the wheels off a pram, and a plank out in the yard,
And you gave us a bit of string but we steered it with our feet.
Oh boy it was the best one on the street,
And you said ""Jesus, that's the best one on the street"".

I remember when your little girl was born
You brought her downstairs to show us all,
And we were allowed to kiss her
And I wished she was my sister.

And summer rolled o'er us with no complications

After the day, but before evening comes
Waiting for castles and kettles with roses
Painted on barges that sailed into the sun.

Ralph McTell,"Oh, the traveller moving on the land, behold I give you, I give you the travelling man.
And he's very heavy laden with the questions in his burden.
Lo, and I give you the travelling man.
He has crossed the mountains, he has forded streams.
He has spent a long time surviving on his dreams.
Many times he's tried to lighten up his heavy load.
But his compromises fail him and he ends back on the road.

Oh the traveller he is weary, the travelling man he is tired.
For the road is never ending in his fear he has cried aloud for a saviour
And in vain for a teacher, someone to lighten up the load
And he's heard the sounds of war in a gentle shower of rain
And the whisperings of despair that he could not explain.
The reason for his journey, or the reason it began
Or was there any reason for the travelling man.

At last he reached a river so beautiful and wide
But the current was so strong he could not reach the other side
And the weary travelling man looked for a ferryman strong enough to row against the tide,
And the ferryman was old but he moved the boat so well,
Or did the river move the boat? The traveller could not tell.
Said the ferryman, ""You're weary and the answers that you seek,
Are in the singing river, listen humbly it will speak.""

Oh, the traveller closed his eyes and he listened and he heard
Only the river murmuring and the beating of his heart.
Then he heard the river laughing, and he heard the river crying
And in it was the beauty and the sadness of the world
And he heard the sounds of dying, but he heard the sounds of birth
And slowly his ears heard all the sounds of earth.
The sounds blended together and they became a whole
And the rhythm was his heartbeat to the music his soul.

And the river had no beginning, as it flowed into the sea
And the seas filled the clouds and the rains filled the streams
And as slowly as the sunrise, he opened up his eyes
To find the ferryman had gone, the boat moved gently on the tide.
And the river flowed within him, and with it he was one
And the seas moved around the earth, and the earth around the sun.
And the traveller was the river, was the boat and ferryman,
Was the journey and the song that the singing river sang.

And I noticed a maid in the very next row and I hoped she'd be my neighbour.
Imagine then my delight when the farmer picked us both.
I spoke not a word in the cart to the farm, but my heart beat in my throat.

My lodging was dry and my master fair and I gave him full measure,
But my envy grew like the corn in the field for in his house was my treasure,
And I'd watch her carry water, or drive cows from the byre,
And the heat from the sun made the corn grow strong and with it my desire.

Well I'd see her in my dreaming and in my dreams caress
Her eyes, her lips and her dark brown hair, the curves beneath her dress.
But harvest time it came at last, so heavy was the task
That the women and the men worked side by side and I had her near at last,

And I swung harder with my scythe, few words between us passed,
And I cursed my tongue-tied youthfulness and I hoped that she'd hear my heart.
When all was safely gathered in and we sat down to rest
My trembling fingers touched her arm, and she placed them on her breast.

And then she turned to me as the sun went down and all my senses reeled,
As we lay there on the scented ground and the moon rose over the field.

She was safely gathered in my arms when from the barn
Drifted the sound of a violin and we hurried back to the farm,
And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air,
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and the girl from the hiring fair.

How he heard the voice of Jesus

He know some day he'll be sailing above

Me with your suitcase being brotherly strong.
And trying to make light of the whole situation,
In mild conversation we moved through the throng,

And above all the roar of the town was the blue sky,
I could here the birds singing for the joy of the day
And there was no support from the city forthcoming,
No sympathy numbing your going away.
It's hard to say goodbye.

And there was you with your bright eyes and best dress for travelling
And me in my work clothes, unshaven and plain,
Oh, I fully intended to put in the half day,
But my good intentions went with you on the train.

And I never looked back as the train left the station,
Crossed over the road and walked into the park,
And there in a bar an old man was singing,
And I sat there drinking until it got dark.

And outside the trees they grew starlings like apples,
Their hustle and chatter not dampened by the rain.
That washed down the pavements and into the gutters,
That soaked through my clothes as I set out again,

And above me the stars were all hidden by rain clouds,
The song of the old man still locked in my brain,
And all emigration, the curse of a nation
The setting now fitting his sad sweet refrain.

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through.

Now he's trying to show he's cool, but I know him
I ain't fooling
And because you love him he's bound to lie
When this time he's got so close
Now's the time to be scared the most
He's looking everywhere but in your eyes.

So don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through.

'S endless coffee and cigarettes
Now don't take it hard when he says
He doesn't need you 'cause that's when he needs you most
He'll cry till he laughs and laugh till he weeps
And suddenly he'll fall asleep
Then you can let your own eyes close

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through
This time I think he's coming through.



",Song for Martin,1996
Ralph McTell,"This summer will be different I will move across the town
Promenade above the beach until my face turns brown
With my hands in my pockets and a casual stroll from the town beach to the dock
The girls they walk in two's and three's, their pretty cotton frocks teased by the breeze.
And I will find a long-limbed summer girl for me.

I will assume the accent of some Yankee sailor boy
Stranded between merchant ships with some time to enjoy.
A week or two down by the bay with tupp'ney ice-cream cones
And petticoats and sandy kisses, breasts smooth as stones washed by the sea
And I will find a long-limbed summer girl for me.

And her name will be Pam or Ruth, so I'll be Chuck or Wayne,
And we will know and love each other, then I will explain
Why I haven't found a ship and that I live in town
Before we share that cigarette, in waves of love, we'll drown down by the sea,
My long-limbed salt-teared summer girl and me.

She won't cry for my leaving, she will cry because I stay
She will cry for my deceiving that we can meet every day
This love affair it grew so strong because we'd have to part,
And now we will do anyway and she will take my heart and I'll be free
To find another summer girl who'll give it back to me.

Ralph McTell,"I said look at the river.
You said it's only a stream.
But I said I've seen people with nets out there
You said they just throw out a line and dream.

I see a river, you see a stream
Wise men sleep it is fools who dream
Men out there trying to net the moon
Come on down to the river (the sun is going down)
The fish will be jumping soon.

Throw out a line and dream.

I said look at the harbour.
You said it's only a quay,
And I said I've seen big ships sailing in,
You said they leave and they sail out to sea.

I say a harbour, you say a quay
You want them locked up I want them free.

Chorus

I said look at the road.
You said it's only a track,
And I said I've seen people with trucks out there
You said they leave and they don't come back.

I say a road and you say a track
I seem to need you just to bring me back
From the edge of the earth where it touches the sky
Come on down to the road (look at the horizon)
And feel the trucks rolling by.

Chorus

I see a river, you see a stream
Wise men sleep, it is fools who dream
Men out there, trying to net the moon
Come on down to the river (the sun is going down)
The fish will be jumping soon.

Ralph McTell,"Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet,
And eating her curds and her whey.
And along came a spider and sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, who do you blame ?
The spider soon finished his web,
And the rain came down, and hung it with diamonds.

And a bird flew along, with the stroke of his wing
Broke the web, he and the spider.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, who do you blame ?
The bird flew up high into the sky,
And the sun lit the tips of his wet wings with fire.
And a man with a gun shot him down to the ground,
And went home and sung in the choir.",Bright and Beautiful Things,1997
Ralph McTell,"If I find another way to save you all this pain
I wouldn't take that evening train,
Or tell you it's goodbye again.
But it would be so wrong of me to stay.

If I find another way that couldn't be the same,
She'd never call me by my name
The way you do, but it's me I blame
And I'm sorry I must leave.

If I try and make you see that things aren't what we plan
And I say goodbye and touch your hand.
I know that you won't understand
The pain is just as great for me.

Ralph McTell,"Hurrying across the bridge before the siren calls.
This morning she's chasing her shadow, along the factory wall.
And through the gate, where she will wait in line.
To cross the yard, to clock her card in time.

And under her scarf, her hair set in curls,
The day begins for the factory girl.
For a while the girls try to talk, but their voices soon drown in the din.
Their eyes watch their hands do the work, and a new day's rhythm begins.

No change today, like yesterday, the same
But dinner soon, then afternoon, then home.
Then hurrying home in the fading light,
The factory girl is going out tonight.

Her momma says ""Don't be late, you've got to get up again before eight"".
""Yes"", she cries, but there's joy in her eyes,
As she runs down the path through the gate.
And out on the rainy streets hoping that the night will last.

No whispering palms on the beach, for her,
Just the swish of the cars going past.
And she believes no one could feel the same,
Touching and whispering in the rain.

And the rain takes away her beautiful curls.
The night is soon gone for the factory girl.
And hurrying across the bridge before the siren calls.
This morning she's skipping the puddles, all along the factory wall.

A starling sings, he shakes his wings, she smiles.
Then at the gate, she hesitates, for a while.
Then from inside the gates, the sirens roar.
And across the yard runs the factory girl.",Factory Girl,2000

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Ralph Napolitano,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there

Ralph Napolitano,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Ralph Napolitano,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now

Ralph Napolitano,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Ralph Napolitano,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

Ralph Napolitano,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,2009
Ralph Napolitano,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2009
Ralph Napolitano,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2009
Ralph Napolitano,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Ralph Pena,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1960
Ralph Pena,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Ralph Pena,"When the work begins to pile up,
And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,
Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work.
",Whistle While You Work,1960
Ralph Pena,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1961
Ralph Pena,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.
