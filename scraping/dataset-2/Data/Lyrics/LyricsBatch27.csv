Casino,"You know, this just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' gotta bus' a K
I'ma take a phone call, hustle everyday

Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from Lil Mexico & Let me Work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah,
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho, callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch ""leave me the fuck alone!""
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolly
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind,
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate!

Made myself a boss, a boss or a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales

Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'til the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tail
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH, look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I mention the monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my E-hoes
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side, now nothin's big as my ego

But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they leave niggas
Gee, nigga

Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
Never honest, guy, I'm tryna let y'all know

Casino Steel,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Say I'm cooking up the heat so I'mma stay hot
And just like that river, I've been running ever since
I know I can't go wrong if I'm on top
I've got the shine on me, when I say me he's gotta ride for the team
Cause I'm on that
The sun hit me every morning, the club with them models
Come and feel 'em like I'm calling
The Don Perrier, probably like a cactus
Throwing every Franklin, I'm a Tim Jackson
Action the napkins, wet, no cash, got a milly after taxes
I'm on the road to winning, I've been exposed to women
Already know what they getting but with the flow in the middle

This right here is why I work for the title, I gotta be an icon
My old man had dreams of putting nice, he rest in peace
A lil bit of him rest in me
Every time that I'm blessed to be
I work hard, got scars, I got a mother I provide for
I got homies I would die for
A big sis I would lie for but I ain't relying on this record
No, I'm working on my vernacular
I'm tryina have a lil' brains to back it up
I used to roll around town in a maxima
Now my next step looking spectacular
And that right there is a blessing

Overnight when we shoot that dice
And I'll probably fly, play that game and did it
Hustle from the bottom and get it
Get this money then flip it

Louboutin, foreign cash, hundred dollars on my kite
Hundred dollars on my flight, hundred G's every night

And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again

The itsy bitsy spider crawled underneath the door
Out came the cake and the crumbs fell on the floor
Back went the cake and the crumbs refused to fall
So the itsy bitsy spider crawled up the kitchen wall

The itsy bitsy spider spun a web all new
Down cam a bird and tore the web in two
The birdie said excuse me and became the spiders friend
Now the its bitsy spider built up his web again

The itsy bitsy spider was tired from the day
Down came a jar and carried him away
Out through a hole and dangle to the ground
Now the itsy bitsy spider is home safe and sound

Home safe and sound
Home safe and sound
Home safe and sound

Im Sumpf aus Billigparfüm und hass mich nicht
War da Licht und ich dacht es leuchtet hell
Dann abgelischt von Lippen rot wie der Teufel selbst
Bitte beginn du von vorn
Aber tu nicht so als würd ich nicht wissen wie's klingt wenn du kommst
Kenn, wie du nach Atem greifst, zitternd ins Laken beißt
Im Endeffekt der perfekte Fehler zur falschen Zeit
Nur gäb es diese Beben nicht, tausend Tode gelegentlich (vor dir)
Stimmt ich bin nie weiter gekommen
Als in dein Bett aber du bist bloß ein paar Zeilen im Song

Das war's, auf das, was war

Aber du wärst nur die Frau von der Bar

Du meintest eines Tages macht das alles Sinn
Eines Tages erkenn ich dich und werf alles hin
Nur verrenn ich mich solang tief hinein
War keine Liebe, nur verliebt darin, verliebt zu sein
Bloß unbedacht rumgemacht
Schwer dich zu verlieren, wo du dich selbst nie gefunden hast
Krumm gelacht, uns entfacht Glut an dem Docht
Lieben ist Scherben fressen, warten wieviel Blut man dann kotzt
Trotz gut angefangenem Bau
Machen vier Wände lange kein Haus (Schatz, nein)

Dein eigenes, kleines Alaska
So kalt, so verlassen und leer
Die Welt zwischen lüsternen Blicken und dem Klang vom Untergang
Deiner zitternden Lippen inmitten
Von „Alles wird Gut“ und „Ich habe den Mut“
Steht ein „Bitte komm zurück“ in der Farbe von Blut
Trotz dem Gefühl, dass ein Ende sich nähert
Schlägt es tapfer, dein emsiges Herz
Da wo du liegst!
Aus dem Bergeversetzen wurd' ein Meer von Komplexen
Im Verbergen Entsetzen, ein Wettbewerb im Verletzen
Vorm gekehrten der letzten Scherben im Haus
Willst du zuhören, doch Schmetterlinge sterben so laut

Notsignale verloren, treiben umher

Neben mir, genau da wo du liegst

Und eisigen Winden, die das Atmen im Keim schon ersticken Inmitten
Von werden und warten, und Entfernungen raten
Bleibt die Lüge vom Freisein ein Sterben auf Raten
Der Tanz von Echolot und Puls wenn er bebt
Malt dein Herz in den Spuren im Schnee,
Nun wo du gehst!
Aus dem Lächeln und Tuscheln, wurd ein ätzendes Nuscheln
Nun anstelle von Kuscheln sinnloses Grenzen Gepushe
Letzten Endes, im Grunde, Stress um Stress
Leuchtgeschosse vor deinen Augen brüll'n „SOS!“ und wieso?
Wenn es doch stimmt, wie sich die Erde bewegt
Sind dann immer die gleichen Sterne zu sehen

Man ich schwör', dann platzt mir der Kopf
Immer nur funktionier'n nach Regeln und Listen
Will inmitten der Schnappschüsse mal das Leben erwischen
Und bin weg, weit weg, da wo dir Fehler verzeihbar sind
An den Ort, wo wir mit 16 dachten, wo wir mit 30 sind
Kein Ärgern und Mist, denn als merkten wir's nicht
Alltag ist Treibsand, du steigst ab, je stärker du trittst
Immer nur langleben von Mahnung zu Mahnung und Ratenabzahlung
Für ein Mal im Jahr, 14 Tage Malle
Ich bin raus, kann schon nach dem Ende 'nen Anfang sehen
Ganz egal, wie lang' der Fall, solange die Landung steht
Vielleicht Saint Tropez, vielleicht weit hinter den Bergen
Vielleicht nur Bielefeld, doch dort, wo noch Grinsen was wert ist
Endlich Laufen lernen
Endlich angefangen, aufzuhör'n (Ah)

Sonnenstrahlen im Gesicht, halte die Welt an

Stotter' das Leasing ab, jeden Morgen von sieben an
Murmeltiertag leben, zu Jesus beten, treu zur Frau
Fleißig und produktiv, ewig lebt der deutsche Traum
Bin ab heute raus, Zeit, um zu gehen
Soweit es mich trägt, verbrannte Brücken leiten den Weg
Mach' mein eigenes Ding, keine Last mitzutragen
Der Trick is' atmen, die Antwort einfach nich' zu fragen (Ah)

Probleme für's Leben zu groß, für's Sterben zu klein
Du weißt, es regnet nicht ewig immer nur schwer
Nur stets zum Kinn und höher, Zeit schwimmen zu lern'n
So gern ich immer da wär'
Kommt's hart auf hart nimm die Faust
Finger raus
Such den Größten der Bande, spring da drauf
Schwing voll aus
Verlieren wirst du nur das eine Mal
Denn ist alles gegeben, denken die nächstes Mal zweimal nach

Das war's: Der Sinn des Lebens ist leben

Der Trick ist immer die Balance zwischen Nehmen und Geben

Nur Todeswunsch, bloß um zu gucken wer kommt
Und bis die Wände da mein Ende war'n
Sind Träume Worte, die der Mund nicht zu denken wagt
Denk ich ma', Bitte sieh
Du warst mein alles
Mein Ritalin
Die Nächte mit den Springsteen Platten
Voll Tränen der Dinge, die man als Kind nie hatte
Plus Mut im Erkennen der Lücke
Mit dem offenarmigen Tanz auf brennenden Brücken
Wir war'n
Auf ins Leben, doch ein Haufen Elend
Vielleicht liegt der Sieg darin einfach aufzugeben
Das Tanzen und Flieh'n
Synchronisiert funken Momente zum Takt der Musik
Stampfen im Beat, klatschen zum Lied
Drängen und Zieh'n
Klammern uns an süße Melancholie
Schatz frag nicht, lass einfach weiterfahren und so tun als gäb es kein Ende der Welt
Doch was ein Kodakmoment, wie dein Herz zerspringt
Ich daneben verschwommen, gucke genervt nach links
Genau, Mister Superstar. Verfluchtes Jahr, den Fuß im Grab
Habe nie nach diesem Talent gefragt
Schrei nur weiter, nur weck mich nicht
Wenn ich endlich schlaf

Diese Medikamente bringen ’nen Scheiß
Bin immer noch da, wenigstens alles taub gemacht
Aufgewacht, schon wieder sie
Wieder tun, als hätte mir das was ausgemacht
Herr Doktor, was muss ich noch sagen im Laden damit ich endlich das gute Zeug bekomm?
Kein Witz, nur noch den einen Trip, um Cas endlich zu töten und Benjamin gleich mit
Will los in das scheiß Licht
Wofür zahl ich die Leihgebühr?
Würd's selber tun, doch bin da zu feige für
Keine Türen, nur vergittertes Glas
Der Traum wird besser verkauft, als es ist
Was Ruhm und Fame?
Zugegeben, ich kann Ian Curtis mittlerweile gut verstehen
Versuch das Leben rosig zu sehen
Aber Depression scheint niemals aus der Mode zu gehen
Schatz, lass mal
Diese Wunden waren immer dort
Zum Verdecken gibt's kein Pflaster der Welt, denn dieses Blut war schon immer dort
Und was uns angeht gab es nie den Mond, nur die Sonne vorm untergehen

Casper,"Ich weiß noch, wie du sagtest „Nie werd ich 27!“
Wir die Lieder sangen, die vom Leben-lieben handeln
Tequila tranken, machten Jägermeister platt
In den Mond schrien „Verdammt, wir sind die geilste Gang der Stadt!“
Kein öder Day-Job-Trott rafft uns hin
Wir sind wie Kurt Cobain, Bon Scott, Pac und Jim
Selbst in Unterzahl ergeben uns nie
Lieber gestanden arm sterben, als reich leben auf Knien
Täglich am Beat, jeder von uns Lieblingsmensch
Du warst unser Bruce, wir deine kleine „E Street Band“
Hatten nie viel Geld, aber jeden Tag mega Brand
Rewe-Markt, Rotwein im Tetrapack für den Weg gezockt
Heut noch denk ich dran, als ob's gestern war
Bist schon immer weg, wenn's auf Partys am Besten war
Red mir einfach ein, dass es deine letzte war
Hoff, du bist angekommen!

Und deine Mum hält dein Zimmer wie du's gelassen hast
An dem Moment, wo dich Willen und Mut verlassen hat
Die Lautsprecher tönen es laut
Dein Lieblingslied, aber hörst du das auch?
Sag, hörst du das auch?
Jedes mal wenn der Wind pfeift und durch Äste weht
Wissen wir du warst da, wolltest nur nach dem Rechten sehn'
Dann warst du kurz zu Besuch
Leider nur zu Besuch, hoff' es geht dir gut, da wo du bist

Nun sind wir 27, bald alt und grau
Keiner wurd' Rockstar von uns, niemand Astronaut
Wie schon gesagt, ging's nach dem Zivi bergab
Vorbei der Teenagerspaß, Perspektiven für'n Arsch
Sieh nur die Stadt, wie sie dabei sind, alles einzureißen
Kreidebleiche Gesichter, schwer von der Zeit gezeichnet
Die kleine Kneipe deines Papas mittlerweile
Das No Future, das Rückseiten uns'rer Jacken prophezeite
Zuviel Korn und Wein treibt zur Morgenzeit Sorgen heim
Ein Ort ertrinkt in Akkordarbeit
Immer noch im vierten Stock in weiß „Ich liebe dich“
Nur das Dumme war
Sandra liebte dich auch!

Und deine Mum hält dein Zimmer wie du's gelassen hast
An dem Moment, wo dich Willen und Mut verlassen hat
Die Lautsprecher tönen es laut
Dein Lieblingslied, aber hörst du das auch?

Jedes mal wenn der Wind pfeift und durch Äste weht
Wissen wir du warst da, wolltest nur nach dem Rechten sehn'
Dann warst du kurz zu Besuch
Leider nur zu Besuch, hoff' es geht dir gut, da wo du bist

Es ist echt schon verrückt, seit du weg von uns bist
Geht jeder getrennte Wege, man lächelt und nickt
Redet's Wetter schlecht, ab und an mal SMS
Bin endgestresst gerad', auch die Musik läuft mehr schlecht als recht
Spring nicht mehr von Bett zu Bett, schwer zu fassen, ich weiß
Kein Plan, ob's Lieben ist, doch was es ist, ich hoff, dass es bleibt
Drück mir die Daumen, war schön dich zu sehn', verdammt
Alles Gute zum Geburtstag, bis nächstes Jahr!

Doch wenn schon scheiße Tanzen dann so, dass die ganze Welt es sieht.

Casper,"Wir können alles und alles können wir sein
Verlorene Jungs zu viel Zeit, zu viel Wein
Drehen Runden um die Stadt
Da gehen Stunden um wie ein Jahr
Nie den Ärger gesucht bis er dann uns gefunden hat
Trotzdem tanzen als ob keiner gucken
Lachen als wenn es jeder liebt
Singen ohne Texte kennen und feiern als ob es kein Ende gibt
Adrenalin, Puls in 45 RPM
Werden wohl zur Hölle fahren, aber das im besten Sinn

Sieh die Kamine der Fabrik
Alles endet aber nie die Musik

Die wollen nur spielen
Lass die spielen
Lass die spielen
Wo die guten Jungs an schlechten Orten
Ohne Hoffnung, ohne Sorgen
Nasenbluten, 6 Uhr morgens, spielen
Zu dem Beat
Alles endet aber nie die Musik
Alles endet aber nie die Musik
Alles endet
Alles endet
Alles endet
Aber nie die Musik

Einer ging zu früh, einer bekam dann Kinder
Einer geht ein und aus, irgendwas ist immer
Einer ging zum Bund, der Rest weg, die Welt erfahren
Ich mach noch immer das Musikding, bin selten da
Da wo lichterloh, mittendrin im Nirgendwo
Nah vorm Rand des Wahnsinns, Liebe findet im Diskoklo
Nacht für Nacht Röcker knapp wie der Verstand
Tigerlady beweg dich, mach uns schwach Takt um Takt

Sieh die Knien in den Kabinen
Alles endet aber nie die Musik

Die wollen nur spielen
Lass die spielen
Lass die spielen
Wo die guten Mädchen an schlechten Orten
Ohne Hoffnung, ohne Sorgen
Nasenbluten, 6 Uhr morgens, ziehen

Casper,"Auf den Schultern von Giganten vielleicht landen wir nie!
Augen groß wie der Mond, sieh wie sich Schatten verziehen!
Atme ganz tief den Moment ein
Lass ihn dann nie los
Spür wie dein Herz grad' einen Schlag überspringt! Und wenn es
Kickt, kickt alle Wände beben dann
Glaub' ich fest, dass ein Text noch immer Leben retten kann
Dass den Liedern, die man liebt, immer Frieden inne liegt
Noten ewig leben, kein Grab zu tief für die Musik
Wenn, wie bei mir, deine größte Sorge Mittelmaß ist
Und ich geh', bitte vergiss mich dann nicht (bitte vergiss mich nicht)
Sprüh's an die Wände, sag' „Wir waren hier“
Anti alles für immer, dank dir!

Wenn ich geh
Wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh
Bin ich doch da, solang die Band noch spielt, ah
Und alles ist gut
Anders, aber gut anders

Wenn ich geh
Wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh
Bin ich doch da, solang die Band noch spielt, ah
Und alles ist gut
Anders, aber gut anders
Wenn ich geh

Und sag mir, wie das war, wo du gingst
Ist es wahr mit den Farben, alles warm und gedimmt?
Als ich den Anruf bekam, die Sprache verging
Alle warten, dass ich was sag'
War nie stark in so Dingen
Aber sag, wie war's? Gab's wo du kamst
Den immerwährenden Chor, die Parade, so wie man sagt?
Ein überwältigendes Nichts hinter blendend grellem Licht
Die größte Party von allen! Hoff' es hält, was es verspricht
Wette, du bist noch in der Bourbon Street und lachst
Über Touristen jede Nacht in den Bars, die du sonst hasst
Und wird es dunkel in der Stadt voller Sünder
„Champagne Supernova“ für immer

Wenn ich geh
Wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh
Bin ich doch da, solang die Band noch spielt, ah
Und alles ist gut
Anders, aber gut anders

Wenn ich geh
Wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh, wenn ich geh
Bin ich doch da, solang die Band noch spielt, ah
Und alles ist gut
Anders, aber gut anders

Und wenn es nicht gut ist, kann es auch nicht das Ende sein
Am Ende wird alles gut

Casper,"Das Gefühl von endlich angekommen
Zügel selbst in die Hand genommen
Nach langem Bangen an Land geschwommen
Endlich an Fahrt gewonnen
Angedockt, eingeschweißt
Leider kein Platz mehr, nein
Der Kreis bleibt klein
Nur noch nach vorne, schreiben hinten im Bus
Lieber hart arbeiten als hoffen, ich hab´s immer gewusst
Kleine Schritte zum Star
Kam von Nichts in die Charts
Leben im Augenblick und fangen den Blitz in 'nem Glas, ein

Applaus, Applaus!

Seh' die Nacht vorbeiziehen zum Tag
Der 16:9-Traum im Breitbildformat
Die Hi-Fi-Anlage ballert böse, lallen ohne groß zu denken
Angetrunken, schlafversunken, singen, don´t look back in anger
Die besten Menschen der Welt
Der beste Platz auf Erden, Zentrum der Welt
Die letzte Gang der Stadt, Tag für Tag nur große Kunst
Mit kleinen Heineken-Dosen im Bus
Prost auf uns

Endlich angekommen, yeah
Und alles zieht vorbei bei bei, bei

Alles zieht vorbei bei bei, bei

Liebe kommt, Liebe geht
Nur was immer bleibt, sind Bilder zur Zeit
Die kann uns niemand nehmen
Die werden´s nie verstehen, lange nicht
Der Moment vor dem Knall
Wo man loslässt und alles gibt
Hör, wie die Menge schreit, vorn-hinten Hände zeigt
Texte schreit, laut in den Himmel, Schweiß an die Wände treibt
Unendlich weit von perfekt, doch angelangt
Keine Supermänner, dennoch verdammt nah dran!

Alles ist, nur noch halb so beschissen wenn die Sonne scheint.
Gleicher Ort, gleiche Zeit. (Komm doch mal wieder vorbei)
Yeah, denn wir sind wieder da
Und liegen hier im Park
Den lieben langen Tag,
Kein Ziel, kein Plan, aber fantastisches Wetter

Trotz all den Wolken und Regen
Vielleicht doch der Sommer des Lebens
Von Freunden umgeben
Tag um Tag, Nacht für Nacht über die Straßen
Aus den kleinsten Orten auf die größten Bühnen des Landes
Wo Abertausend draußen stehen
Applaus so laut wie nie
Kaum zu glauben wenn ein Traum endlich laufen lernt und fliegt Yeah
Nie Zeit mit Schule vergeudet
Die Klassenclowns von gestern verderben die Jugend von heute
Yo, das ist Casper-Gang, Kraftklub, live in deiner Stadt
Platinplattenbande, Kerle schreien, Weiber dreh'n am Rad
Vielleicht nicht immer, Zukunft ungewiss
War nicht der sonnigste Sommer, doch alles gut wie es ist!

Nehmen nie zu viel Bissen für's Bauchgefühl
Die falschen Drogen zur richtigen Zeit
Werfen Schatten, wo das Licht nie scheint für kurze Zeit
Und übernehmen Straßen abends
Immer Wasser bis zum Hals, lieber Regenparka tragen
Sprachlos, tanzen statt reden
So müde von der Stadt, die nie schläft, bleib in Bewegung
Hörst du den Chor? Schief und doch schön
Höhen leicht daneben, wir sind Tiefen gewöhnt
Mit großen Augen zwischen Bahnschienen und Schrebergärten
Arm in Arm singend über Leben die wir nie leben werden
So wie das Ding hier nun mal läuft
Kleinganovenbeichte mit zwei Fingern über Kreuz
Wir sind Legenden, wir selbst
Gemeinsam vor'm Ende der Welt

In diesem Hinterland, verdammtes Hinterland
Wo Gedanken im Wind verwehen
Und die Zeit scheinbar nie vergeht (vergeht, vergeht)
Geliebtes Hinterland, willkommen im Hinterland

Immer Steine schmeißen, hautpsache laut
Für alles zu haben, für kaum was zu gebrauchen
In diesen Hinterwelten getrieben von Kindergeld
Wo Taten mehr sagen als Worte, sind die Stille selbst
Man gibt uns gut zu verstehen

Will auf und davon und nie wiederkommen

Sofort los, sorglos, ohne groß‘ Fokus Richtung Zukunft fahren
Weg von immer nur leben ohne Riesengefahren
Jede Nacht lang, Schlaf nur Probeliegen für'n Sarg
Werf' ein Streichholz in die Luft auf den Rest meines Lebens
Und blicke nur zurück, um eure Gebäude brennen zu sehen,
im Ascheregen
Sieh nur wie die Pläne zerfallen
Ehe wir langsam verglühen, dann lieber gehen mit 'nem Knall, ah!

Ein Drittel Heizöl, zwei Drittel Benzin
Augen und Herzen sind Dynamit (hey hey hey hey)

Wieder wird das Weihwasser knapp für die Bürger der Neinsager-Stadt
Wieder redet der Prediger lediglich ewig und wir zum Scheitern verdammt
Vorbei das Warten umsonst auf den Tag, der nie kommt
Bin im Wagen davon, los und starte von vorn uh
Kein Schritt zurück, nehm' von hier kein bisschen mit
Blick zu lange in den Abgrund und er blickt zurück, Hitze drückt
Lieber Neubeginn, als was das alte verspricht

Kreischen nun meinen Namen
Klappen dabei zusammen
Haben Ohnmachtsanfälle bevor wir angefangen haben

Komm aus nem Redneck Ort,
Lieben NASCAR dort so wie Chevvy Ford
Wo der Vetter Bob in nem Methlabor seine Päckchen kocht
Allein mit Taperecorder dort in nem Kinderzimmer
Groß gezogen auf Peter Tosh, Dylan und Lynyrd Skynyrd
Sommer immer nie Winter, Sand so rot wie die Haut
Zirpende Grillen klingen, Moskitos so groß wie ne Faust

Komm mit der Boom Boom Band im Rücken, Wände zittern
Fühl die Bässe drücken, wie Fans am Geländer sich ans Ende schwitzen
Stundenlang Händeschütteln, Küsschen für Mister Griffey
Kam von Atlanta, Alabama zu den Sümpfen von Mississippi
Yo mit Schrot in den Flinten, im Suff auf Dosenbier schießen
Biss mich von unten nach oben so wie nen Krokodil-Kiefer

Und ein Lächeln, das niemand vergisst
Ihr Blick, wie 'n Strick, an deinem Hals
Wie sie Feuerwasser trinkt
Mehr summt als dass sie singt
Jungenblut trockenpustend an den Krallen
Wie's so geht, geht, geht
Jede Rettung kommt leider zu spät
Und klapp!, schnappt's der Maus, ins Genick
Mitleid bekommt, wer Mitleid verdient
Somit jeder da, der sie nur sieht
Und der bittersüßen Sinfonie erliegt

La-la-la-lass  dich fallen, und gib dich einfach hin
Denn für dich ist das Licht schon in Sicht
La-la-la-lass dich fallen, und nimm es einfach hin
Wehr dich nicht, mein Kind Blick ins Licht

Sieh den Mann in Schwarz an der Bar
Der Blick, den er dir zuwarf
Eine Flut aus Blut vernebelt dein Hirn
Es vergeht dort keine Nacht, wo er keine Beute macht
Ein Kuss lässt deinen Puls sofort erfrieren
Wie's so geht, geht, geht
Jede Rettung kommt leider zu spät
Und klapp, schnappt's der Maus ins Genick
Mitleid bekommt, wer Mitleid verdient
Somit jede da, die ihn nur sieht
Und den Schutz für nur eine Nacht vergisst

La-la-la-lass dich fallen und gib dich ein hin
Denn für dich ist das Licht schon in Sicht
La-la-la-lass dich fallen und nimm es einfach hin
Wehr dich nicht, mein Kind Blick ins Licht

Dieser Ort am Rande der Stadt
Jede Seele, die ihn betrat
Spurlos verschwand und ward nie mehr gesehen
Also denk noch einmal nach
Sei gewarnt, eh du dich wagst
Du bist jung und hast noch viel zu leben

Hing heim allein, bis 19 Uhr

Lieg im Etagenbett, Gedanken vertieft in riesigen Stadien
Miese Gitarrenriffs, liebe das Rampenlicht

Keine Zeit für Politik, weil jedes Parlament die Farben trennt
Kein Wunder, dass hier nachts auch mal die dicken Wagen brenn'

Es ist als ob man den Verstand verliert
Immer Wege voller Steine wären
Trotz all den Hallelujas hier
Keinem was heilig mehr
Die gebrochenen Kinder der zerbrochenen Stadt
Stimmung könnte jeder Zeit kippen, aber noch ist's im Takt (tanz, tanz!)
Wirf alles ab, lass es brennen in dir!
Was ein wundervolles Ende das wird!

Diese Wände kommen näher
Fühl' mich wie ich fühl', weil ich nix mehr fühl'

Keine Angst!
Denn alles, was hier war
Ist morgen vielleicht schon egal
Außer Gefahr
Keine Angst!
Denn das, was du jetzt bist
Ist nicht, was du für immer sein wirst
Nicht für immer sein wirst, nicht für immer sein wirst, nicht für immer sein wirst
Keine Angst!

Würd' lieber sterben, als nach Hause gehen
Einfach loslassen im freien Flug
Atmen, warten bis der Staub sich legt
Ruhig Blut, alles gut
Erst ein Summen, dann ein Chor, dann ein Schreien in Harmonie
Veränderung in der Luft, nur zu Greifen scheinbar nie
Alle wie, halbwach im Tiefschlaf, Druck in der Brust
Nun wird Luft in lahme Lungen gepumpt

Casper,"Meine Damen und Herren, wir bitten zum Sitz
Noch ein Gong, dann dimmt sich das Licht
Für den finalen großen Trick, werd' ich einfach so verschwinden
Wie's scheint, in ein winziges Nichts
Raunen im Raum, Applaus überwältigend laut
Ihr werdet staunen, euch fragen wohin
Wurd' schon in zwei Teile zersägt, den Wassertank überlebt
Doch für den letzten Akt bitt' ich um Stille

Bin und war kein Held, den ihr braucht
Will untergehen in Wellen von Applaus
Überwältigend laut, oh ja
Und wenn's soweit ist, dann hält mich nichts auf
Macht mir kein Denkmal und stellt mich nicht auf
Will einfach endlich hier raus, oh ja

Bin langsam schon müde von Hasen in Hüten
Ballons halten üben und dem
Ewigen doppelten Boden, Lockern der Knoten
Dem Hokuspokus unterwegs
War so viele Jahre immer: „Los, zieht 'ne Karte, Kinder!“
Irgendeine vom großen Stapel, ich rate sicher
Tragisch ist, magisch wird's nur, wenn man glaubt
Noch ein Akt und ich bin raus

Bin und war kein Held, den ihr braucht
Will untergehen in Wellen von Applaus
Überwältigend laut, oh ja
Und wenn's soweit ist, dann hält mich nichts auf
Macht mir kein Denkmal und stellt mich nicht auf

Aber zum Ende nun, achtet auf Hände gut
Nicht die lächelnden Assistentinnen, seht mir zu
Die Lasershow, der Nebelrauch
Bloß Illusion, wie sonst alles im Leben auch
Da nahm das ätzende Verraten, verdammte Wechseln der Lager
Den Fetzen restlichen Spaß aus den Hallen
Nach einer letzten Verbeugung vor der lechzenden Meute
Dann dem betäubendsten, lautesten Knall
Brech ich zusammen

Wir rollen an,schon hängt die Kleine
Hechelnd an der Fensterscheibe
Bring sie her, kostenlos mach ich sie zu Charlotte Roche,
Zum Pavian, die Vagina
Verfärbt sich 2/3 Wochen Rot
Setz mich ein für Menschenfeinde
Vorbildlich und fresh gestylt
Zeig ich mich von der besten Seite
Heb den Krug und ex' die Scheiße
Und wer gerne mitmachen will
Muss sich, wir haben nur ein bisschen drauf stehen
Auszurasten, auszupacken, das und ein gewisses Aussehen
Wenn es klappt hielten sie Händchen
Und schon geht es verdächtig schnell ein Pflock in ihrem Kopf
Zu schieben wie beim Legomännchen
Sie hat mehr fremde Spinner,beherbergt als mein Gästezimmer
Ein paar Bier, 2 Döner nur mit Fleisch: ein perfektes Dinner
Und als Gastgeschenk stürmen vier Leute
Als Straßengang,bewaffnet in dein Haus und feiern Abrissparty

Bin dein Idol. Doch deine Mum findet das katastrophal, da

Sag zu Ihnen: Ey, ich mach zehn Riesen Netto jeden Monat
Also los geht auf die Knie und dann lächelt wie ein Donut!
Sie kichern nur, also drück ich Ihren Kopf nach unten
Und werd dann von den Schlampen angezeigt wie Boxkampfrunden
Doch scheiß auf Staatsanwälte, ey, ich hab Star-Anwälte

Me mata cuando gritas y te pones en cuatro patas

Tú también quieres repetir desde que probaste
No digas que no, lo noté por más que disimulaste
Desde que te vi, tú me gustaste
Toma diez mil pesos, vete pa'l mall, pa' que los gastes
Inolvidable, yo soy un cazador y tú eres una fiera indomable

Cass County Boys,"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted “On Dasher” and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!”

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

He said ""hoein' ain't no fun"", he ain't got no ambition

Cass County Boys,"Mommy told me something a little girl should know
It's all about the Devil and I've learned to hate him so
She says he causes trouble when you let him in the room
He will never ever leave you if your heart is filled with gloom

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grin
But oh, he starts a-running when the light comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hangin' around

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

If I forget to say my prayers the Devil jumps with glee
But he feels so awful, awful, when he sees me on my knees
So if you're full of trouble and you never seem to win
Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Cass Daley,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

So you see it's all up to you

Words & Music by Margo Guryan

Somewhere it is sunny
And people may be happy
And somewhere there are people
Making money by the week
But I can't think about that
All I can think about is you

You walked into my life
Smiling on a cold and windy day
If I hadn't been careful
You would've stole my heart away

But I think once
And I think twice 
About everything I do
And what I do
I think a lot about you

Somewhere it is raining
And people are unhappy
And people are complaining
That the world has gone to pot 
But I don't worry a lot
I think a lot about you

You walked into my life 
Looking like a lion to be tamed 
If I hadn't controlled me 
You know I might have been ashamed
(In the morning)

But I think once 
And I think twice 
About everything I do
And what I do
I think a lot about you

Sizing up candidates first election day
You thought ""I'm a teen and have no opinion either way""

You had a lot of friends but no peers 
Could you imagine this could drag on four more years
If one day you had more peers then friends
It's because your means had caught up with you ends

Jaws are wagging ""the one or the two""
Eager to put John Hancock on the who's who
Voting seemed almost like a disease
An absolute a day if you're feeling ill at ease

Thought about becoming a cop
Any job with a helmet in case of a drop
You did what anyone else would do in your place
You toyed with the idea of entering the race

Instead of living in your own filth
You had the nerve to think crop could spring from your tilth
You were called ""Diva"" by a protective young man
They still call you every name they can

He sold cookies from his parents' freezer
But were we ever really ever close?

So, naturally, on my court date I failed to appear

Eventually, the cardboard comet had to fall
I took a walk down the long hall
The first thing I did from my cell
Was write a letter in search of Daniel
Daniel was indeed in the lion's den
Not the only Lionkiller in a California State Penn.

Daniel wrote me back in a matter of days
No mention of whether or not crime pays
He wrote: “You wouldn't recognize my anymore”
“I bet you'd rather be back cleaning toilets in Baltimore”
“I'll never make it out of this cell”
“I guess the next time you see me will be in Hell”

The letters stopped rolling in
I heard Daniel was stabbed with a ballpoint pen
About sixty times by his cellmate, Charles
Now people talk about immortalizing him in marble

Let it show, you no longer have to hide

I'll be there with you 'til the end's upon us;
When our eyes collide, I know you well

It's almost dead silence when the lights go out
I like to make believe that I have the show shut down
'Cause then I feel relieved when the bass slowly sounds
A crystal light shines and echoes through the crowd

The people erupt and I become a part of the
Machine that moves directly to the beat and I
Am one with you and everyone who's heart is here
Let yourself go, this is the only time to feel alive
This brings me out to you and I'll say

I'll scream it 'til my heart comes out of my chest
And leave it to the music to transcend the rest

So many reasons to live; I need to to let them show
I've made the hardest mistakes; I need to let them go
I feel the tempo rise, my eyes open wide
I feel the well that is my heart overflow,
And now I'm losing control

When all of us are together?
Never thought it would come down to this

Never went to bed without eating
At thirteen I finally realized what it means to get on with your life
Well daddy sure did and he made it look easy

And I thought you were innocent

I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
You turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doin' I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
And no matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

If you ask me how I'm doin' I would say I'm doin' just fine

We used to be the ones that they wished they were

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke dir jetzt mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 
Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke dir jetzt mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 

Mein Engel es tut mir so Leid 
Es tut mir so Leid, dass ich das jetzt hier schreib 
Ich bring es jetzt kaum übers Herz 
Du bist nicht hier und ich schreib diesen Vers 
Schreib diesen Vers schreib ihn für dich 
Leider schreib ich diese Zeilen für dich 
Ich hoffe dass du mir verzeihst 
Wenn du das hier liest hoff' ich dass du nicht weinst 
Es fällt mir so unendlich schwer 
Ich wünschte dass unsere Zeit unendlich wäre 
Ich sitz' hier und riech' deinen Duft 
Mir kommen die Tränen und ich krieg keine Luft, doch
Ich muss weg ich lass dich jetzt hier 
Ich guck mich an und ich hass' mich dafür 
Ich würde dir so viel so gerne sagen 
Ich würde wenn ich könnte die Sterne fragen 
Wenn ich selber die Antwort nicht sehe 
Du bist der Frühling der Sommer der Schnee 
Ich hab so was wie dich nicht verdient 
Du hast so was wie mich nicht verdient 
Lass mich los ich bete für dich 
Auch wenn ich dann weg bin leb' ich für dich 
Guck was für ein grauer Tag 
Es macht alles Sinn wenn man die Trauer mag ah 

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 

Liebe an sich (An sich)
kennt kein Verzicht 
Zeit bringt uns Licht 
Ob deine Wahl richtig ist 

Ich spüre deinen Herzschlag 
Unter der kalten Oberfläche die uns getrennt hält 
Und egal was du jetzt sagst 
Ich fühl' die Angst vor der Schwäche in der du langsam zusammenfällst 
Und dennoch bin ich hier 
Gebe dir die liebe die draußen niemand für dich so zu bieten hat 
Ist dir klar was du riskierst 
Man vermisst nur das was man hergibt 
Und später nicht mehr für sich hat 

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt (Zuletzt, zuletzt, zuletzt)
Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 

Es kann schon sein doch ich 
Kann mich nicht anders entscheiden 
Lange vorbei sind die Sandkasten Zeiten 
Vielleicht mach ich jetzt alles falsch 
Ich spühr' diese Klumpen in meinem Hals 
Ich schluck' und rede nicht mehr 
Ich guck und seh' dich nicht mehr 
Ich lass nichts mehr an mich heran 
Schenk' dein Leben einem anderem Mann 
Steh' auf und geh ohne mich 
Ich frag irgendwann den Wind wo du bist 
Wenn du mich dann flüstern hörst 
Denk an mich und ich küss dein Herz 
Du warst immer mein Kerzenlicht 
Ich gehe wenn es am schwersten ist 
Sei nicht traurig du kannst nichts dafür 
Auch wenn es schwer ist die Angst ist die Tür 

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt (Mich verletzt) 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 
Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt (Verletzt)

Wir wippen im Takt, der Slip ist nass doch kein Thema
Bestraf´ dich wie dein Lehrer, pack' dich du schreist „Yeah“

Hauptsache ist du machst es wild

Du hast mich im Griff, meine Kraft lässt mich im Stich
Fass mich an, tu was du nicht lassen kannst
Was immer es ist, ist innerlich, ist fast wie ein Zwang
Es macht mich krank, spricht Wörter die verwirren
Dein Körper soll nur mir gehören

Cassandra Steen,"Einen langen Weg legt man zurück, 
Einen längeren hat man vor sich,
Jeder schmiedet sein eigenes Glück, 
So wie ich meins, aber richtig.
Noch längst nicht die Hälfte erreicht, 
Von all dem, was ich anstrebe,
Doch ich hab' und nehme mir die Zeit, 
Meine Träume auszuleben

Ich seh' nach vorn und hab' 
Noch Luft für paar Alben Konzerte und Features, 
Interviews und Videos auf VIVA.
Sieh ich mach' mein Ding, schreite vor bis zum Ziel, 
Bring' Rawness in`s Spiel und avanciere vom Underdog hin zum Chief.
Denn nichts hält mich auf, bis auf den Dreck den 
Ihr macht und den Dreck den Ihr quatscht, 
Weil Ihr meine Art von Texten nicht habt.
Es ist nie zu spät, um die Dinge zu ändern, 
Dein Hirn zu verwenden, mal Liebe zu schenken, 
Die Krisen zu bändigen.
Gib nicht auf und wage es und warte nur auf deine Chance, 
Bleib nur weiter am Ball und irgendwann starte durch.
Lass nicht los und befrei' deinen Geist, 
Bleib eisern und zeig's den Zweiflern Du bist heiß und bereit, äh yo!

Nichts hält mich, höher und weiter zu gehen.
Nichts hält mich, weit über der Welt zu stehen.
Nichts hält mich, keine Last wird mir zu schwer.
Nichts hält mich, ich hole mir alles und mehr.

Ich kille Mics und spucke flüssiges Feuer, 
Bin schlüssig und feuer' meine Schüsse, ich erfüll' meine Träume.
Hab' längst noch nicht alles, ich kämpf' bis ich falle, 
Ich stell' mich der Sache, ich werd' mich aufraffen, 
Es allen zeigen und ausrasten.
Auch wenn meine Stimme scheiße klingt, weil ich fertig und heiser bin, 
Geb' ich keinen Fick und spit', 
Weil ich weiß, dass ich immer heißer bin.
Ha, Ihr habt mir nichts vorzuwerfen, 
Nehmt Eure Mics und geht oder kommt, um sofort zu sterben.

Jeder Tag gehört mir, ich hab' 
Nichts zu verlieren,
Beherrsche bald schon das Spiel.
Mir ist egal, was Ihr denkt, 
Weil`s mein Leben nicht lenkt.

Cassandra Steen,"Mein Gefühl sagt mir weiter zu gehen, aber ich weiß nicht wie
Jeder scheint außer mir im Leben zu stehen und kommt an sein Ziel
Auf meine Kosten und sagt mir es ist alles gut
Und doch verlier´ ich Geduld verspüre Angst und Wut
Seid Ihr wirklich zu blind um zu wissen was ihr tut
Seid Ihr wirklich zu blind um zu wissen was ihr tut

Das Schicksal fickt mal eben dein ganzes Leben
Menschen wollen Cash als würde es nichts anderes geben
Das Schicksal fickt mal eben dein ganzes Leben
Menschen wollen Macht als würde es nichts anderes geben

Es scheint nicht einfacher zu werden 
Trotz überstandener Vergangenheit
Es wirkt leichter aufzugeben wenn ich fort bin gibt es euch mehr Zeit
Nachzuholen was Ihr verfehlt habt ich nehm´ mir nicht die Chance
Zu lernen und zu nehmen was das Schicksal zu lehren hat
Ich stell´ mich allem und jedem die Kraft soll mir nicht fehlen
Werde weiter mein Bestes geben und Dinge durch die weisen Augen eines Kindes sehen
Seid Ihr wirklich zu blind um zu wissen was ihr tut
Seid Ihr wirklich zu blind um zu wissen was ihr tut

Ich selbst war im Frieden doch was jetzt angeht
Hab´ ich mentale Krisen wie A-Z-A-D
Entsetzt vernehm´ ich Lehrer sind abschussgefährdet
Weil man den Kindern erzählt dass sie ohne Abschluss nichts wert sind
Wir verschmutzen die Erde vernichten ihre Pflanzen und Tiere
Ich struggle täglich und hab´ Angst diesen Kampf zu verlieren
Ich danke ihr auch wenn ich meiner Mutter Sorgen bereite
Weil sie ihr Leben damit verbracht hat nur für mein Morgen zu fighten
Worte zu schreiben hilft mir und lindert den Schmerz
Meinen Traum verwirklichen ist kaum möglich, denn ihr hindert mich sehr
Ich find´ es nicht fair Ihr fickt meinen Kopf wie ein Leben im Bau
Weil ihr für Euros dem Teufel Eure Seele verkauft
Wem kann ich trauen blutgetränkt sind diese wirklichen Rhymes
Ich wär´ gern ein guter Mensch in meiner irdischen Zeit
Vielleicht komm´ ich in die Hölle weil ich es nicht anders verdien´
Bis dahin hör´ ich die Engelsstimme von Cassandra Steen

Seele im Herz
Du fliegst vorbei und ich merk´s
Will nur dich bei mir

Cassandra Steen,"Ein Apfel und ein Ei, ist wie ein Dietrich und ein Schraubenschlüssel
Nichts wenn Du allergisch bist oder den Kitzel nicht brauchst
Während er die Tür knackt bin ich am Tor
Mein Finger ruhend am Abzug, oh mein Gott bin ich verliebt
Schmetterlinge im Bauch, Pupillen in Form von Rosa Herzen
Ich spür´ meinen Körper nicht, 
Und doch fühle ich die Kälte die uns umgibt
Doch ich vertrau´ auf unsere Liebe
1000 Bilder schwirren durch meinem Kopf, 
Als er mir das Signal gibt

Stille im Einkaufszentrum, 
So plump doch ganz real
Stille im Einkaufszentrum, 
So plump doch ganz real

Als wir das Foyer betreten, mein Herz lauter als seines
Doch sein pochen spür´ ich klar
Unser Rhythmus bindet uns durch und durch
Adrenalin wie Lust und Angst zugleich, 
Verschwinden im Anblick des Moments
Wir plündern was das Zeug hält
Und vergessen dabei die Gefahr, die um uns Herrscht
Während ich den Seesack fülle, leert er eine Schmuckvitrine
Doch wir merken nicht, dass wir beobachtet werden

Bonnie and Clyde 2000 and 3 u feel
Mein Baby hinter mir, und nur der eine Gedanke in meinem Kopf
Wenn sich keiner bewegt dann wird keiner verletzt
Aber die erste von euch Fotzen die sich rührt wird zerfetzt
Scheiß' drauf jetzt is´ Ladenschluss längst vorbei
00:15 Uhr und wir wollen keine Gangster sein
Durch das Fenster rein und schnell´n bisschen reich werden
Ich hab´ meinem Babe versprochen, nie wieder Hotels unter 3 Sternen
Und wer verwirft schon seine Ziele gern
Der Mann der euch beklaut hat ´ne Familie zu ernähren

Ihr scheint so viel davon zu haben, dass ihr den Scheiß verkauft
Und wir vier ham' seit Tagen, nichts als Reis im Bauch
Das meiste braucht Ihr eh nich´ also nehmen wir´s mit
Und werden nie mehr drüber reden, denn wir leben den Shit
War da eben ´n Schritt, das wird mein Baby gewesen sein
Sie packt Stofftiere ein, 2 für jeden der kleinen
Es sind nur wenige Minuten, von ganz arm zu ganz reich
Und nur noch ein paar Meter, wir ham´s gleich
Scheiße die Tür

Stille im Einkaufszentrum, so plump doch ganz real
Stille im Einkaufszentrum, so plump doch ganz real

Zwei Seesäcke, sind voll mit unsere Zukunft
Die so vage scheint, und sich nicht preisgibt
Denn es ist an uns sie zu gestalten
Ich weiß nicht mehr was es war, das Licht oder der Lärm der Schockte
Doch nach kurzem Blackout schaute ich hoch
Dort lag er, mein Herz blutend, weinend vor Schmerz
Bevor ich reden kann höre ich nur
„Ich liebe Dich, die Kinder“ und folge seinen Augen zur Tür

Stille im Einkaufszentrum, 
So plump doch ganz real
Stille im Einkaufszentrum, 
So plump doch ganz real

Als ich mich wieder finde, Tränen überströmt
Und voll bepackt neben der Brücke zum Glück
Sehe ich zu wie sie Ihn raustragen in weißen Tüchern

Soviel Blut hab´ ich vergossen aus Wut und Grausamkeit
Gebrochene Herzen überall und Schmerzen auf meinem Weg
Mein Banner genäht aus Sehnsucht und weil ich erst jetzt versteh´
Meine Rüstung war aus Stahl, gleich meine Seele immer schien
Mein Schwert traf stets den falschen in ungezählten Siegen

Der Regen trifft mein Haupt, doch wäscht mich niemals rein
Durchnässt meine edle Kleidung, bis tief in mein Gebein
Dringt durch zu meinem Innern, das einst so mutig war
Heute bin ich zerbrochen wie ein gefangener Jaguar
Wie ein Pulsar hab´ ich geleuchtet finster doch bewusst
In einem Kreuzzug gegen Wärme, um jeden Preis und auch Verlust
Hätt´ ich nur nicht dich getroffen, hätt´ ich dich nur nie gekannt

Es ist schöner hier ich verspüre dich so intensiv

Wie du leidest und du liebst wenn du bei mir bist
Komm zu mir, komm zu mir wo die liebe ist

Einfach gut endlich mit dir eins zu sein

Blicke straight nach vorn, Homie, ich komm doch noch ans Ziel
Ich war schon so manches mal am Boden doch bin nie gefallen

Doch die Kälte lässt die Herzen erfrieren
Kann nicht die Sonnenseite finden

Den wir träumen, wir wollen immer noch rauf
Egal, ich schick dir meine Liebe zwischen den Zeilen
Auf, dasss sie dich ein bisschen stärkt in bitteren Zeiten, glaub mir

Nur ein paar Narben bleiben bestehen

Will wieder unsere Familie vereint
Ich will den Frieden wieder sehen und nie wieder den Streit

Wir haben schon genug Zeit vergeudet
Uns in Streitigkeiten zu verstricken

Denk einfach einmal drüber nach

Ich werd euch jeden eurer Träume erfüllen

Ich kann nich verstehen
Ich habe meinen eigen Fleisch und Blut
Aber darf es nicht sehen
Manchmal dreht sich alles in die falsche Richtung
Bitte, Vater, reich mir deine Hand
Denn ich weiß nicht wohin sonst
Und bitte hab ein Auge auf meinen kleinen Engel
Flüster in ihr Ohr, dass ich sie immer lieben werde ohne Ende
Und bitte, Vater, sei nicht zornig mit mir
Manchmal benehme ich mich dumm
Denn zuviel Zorn ist in mir
Verzeih, eines Tages hoff ich dass mein Lachen wiederkehrt
Und ich wieder frei bin von dem Schmerz, der mich niederzerrt
Vielleicht eines Tages wenn sie alt genug ist
Wenn sie tun kann was sie will
Kommt sie von selbst zu mir und sucht mich, Engel
Ich werd mit offenen Armen immer auf dich warten
Reserviere meine Liebe bis ans Ende meiner Tage
Ich sterbe vor Schmerz

Mein Ego ist durchwachsen wie der Wald in Brasilien war
Ich bau' mir mein Ding zieh's durch, bis man mein Echo hört
Echauffiert euch, ich bewahr mir eure Ehrfurcht
M.C.'s seh'n uns als Verfechter einer neuen Ära
Ich bin nicht euer Lehrer, ich seh' das Ganze 'nen bisschen klarer
Kein Klugscheisser, der denkt sein Shit sei deep und stinkt nicht
Alter, mach mal Platten, jeder zweite linkt dich
Doch ich bin jung und open-minded, weiß wen
Ich als Freund und Feind hab, bereue keinen Tag
An dem ich redlich Revue passieren ließ und endlich alles verwarf
Weil erstens Ansichten sich ändern und zweitens ich das darf
Es ist in meinen Texten nachzulesen, ich frage mich
Wie lang man braucht, um sich aus der Namenlosigkeit zu lösen
Sich und sein Wesen zu offenbarn
Wo bleibt die Antwort auf die Frage die noch offen war?
Allein dieser Umstand nimmt uns schon die Illusion
Man sehnt sich nach Ruhm, Sensation will Fusion
Buhlt um die Gunst des Konsumkids, denk an den Stumpfsinn

Lauf euch nicht hinterher für'n Platz in eurer Plattenkiste
Ich kenn den wahren Wert auch wenn ich nur im Schatten dichte
Banaler Rap ist Publik und macht uns
In Sachen Kunst zu 'ner Bananenrepublik
Nur das Gute liegt so nah, warum in die Ferne schweifen?
Wenn wir lernen und reifen, bevor wir nach den Sternen greifen

Träumt von Ruhm wie Jacko, hört er sieben mal den Gecko

Ich bin kein Macho, Chauvie, kein Sexiest oder dergleichen
Kann nur nicht begreifen, wenn jetzt plötzlich Mädchen nach
Mir pfeifen
Früher saß ich wochenlang, vor dem schweigenden Fern-
Sprecher
Nicht mehr Kontakt als ein Hochsicherheitstraktschwerver-
Brecher
""Kein Schwein ruft mich an, keine Sau interessiert sich für
Mich""
War mein Motto, war auf Eis gelegt wie 'n Eskimo
Tut's jetzt nicht bin ich gottfroh und sie fragen warum bist du
So arrogant
Ich frag' warum kommt ihr jetzt angerannt
Und war ich eigentlich interessant als ich als MC Unbekannt
War

Ich fand' dich immer wunderbar

Jetzt klingelt's morgens

Mittags

Abends

Nachts
Ich hab' seit deinem Konzert nur noch an dich gedacht

Ich will dich wiedersehen

Lass' uns essen gehen

Ich bin auf Diät

Wie wär's mit Fahrrad fahren

Bin ein Sicherheitsrisiko

Oder 'n Weißwein in 'ner Bar

Hinter Bergen aus Stacheldraht stehe ich
Wir sehen uns an
Die Welt um uns rum versinkt im Nichts

So leicht zerbrichst
Und du siehst wie es schlägt
Mein Herz schlägt nur für dich

I held my breath and said ""may I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

there were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring
I keep I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to
meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning
daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing

Makes you turn your pages slow
Is life more precious than we know?
Every day unfolds
(Every day)

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid?
(Why should you be so afraid?)
I've seen brighter, seen darker days

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid?
(Why should I be so afraid?)
Sittin' here watching
It's just another parade

Just another parade
Just another parade
Just another parade

So tell me why
Why are you so afraid?
Why should I be afraid?
When you know we've seen brighter
We've seen darker days
So tell me why, why should I be afraid?
Why should you be afraid?

Sittin' here watchin' it's just another parade

Cassandra Wilson,"'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Cassandra Wilson,"I pulled in to Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
'Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?''

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free

And you put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said 'Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown''
She said 'I gotta go but my friend can stick around''

Go down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgment day
'Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?''
He said 'Do me a favor son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?''

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said 'I will fix your rat if you'll take Jack my dog''
I said 'Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man''
He said 'That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can?''

Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Won't hear you cry or hear you laugh

I can always hear you breathe

But be there when you need me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me

At night I'd ask more.
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong ?
And why does what I want always take so long ?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me ?

I'd say, Grandma what is love ?
Will I ever find out ?
Why are we so poor, what is life about ?
I want to know the answers before I fall off to sleep.

She sort of smiled as she tucked me in.
Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again.
But tonight she was slightly, remarkably
Different somehow

Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep.
Grandma yawned as she stretched.
Then she started to speak.
What she told me, would mold me, and hold me
Together inside.

She said all the things you ask
You will know someday.
But you have got to live in a patient way.
God put us here by fate
And by fate that means better days.

She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night.
Ain't no morning gonna come 'til the time is right.
Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night.
You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.

You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night.
Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
(Be patient) oh baby, be patient.

Later that year, at the turn of spring,
Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings.
Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding
In better days

And although I'm all grown up
I still get confused.
I stumble through the dark
Getting bumped and bruised.
When night gets in my way
I could still hear my Grandma say
I can hear her say,
I can hear her say.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night baby.
(Be patient) Oh,  you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
Child, do you hear me, yeah.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it, you got to make it
You got to make it
You got to make it through the night

(Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma
Do you see me now, lady
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Be patient) She used to sit me on her knee
She used to comb my hair
She used to tell me stories
My Grandma took me everywhere",Better Days,2014

Cassandre McKinley,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

On a vraiment bien fait d'se barrer d'ce bar de fils de putes,
Il m'a mis la haine!
Ouais c'était naze!
Ça nous a coûtés du gent-ar, on a pas serré d'meufs, c'était que d'la deum's!
Mmh mmh
T'sais quoi, ça m'a rappelé trop une mauvaise appréciation
Qu'un prof d'anglais m'avait mis en BTS.
Il t'avait mis quoi?
T'sais c'qu'ils m'avait noté c'bâtard?
Vas-y!
Jeune homme à la personnalité fantasque!
Mais bon c'est pas grave, j'ai un double réconfort pour vous ce soir.
Vas-y!
Le premier, c'est qu'il nous reste le pack de 24 dans l'coffre de mon ter-scoo
Cool
Et la deuxième, c'est qu'j'ai mon couplet pour l'album!
Attends, attends Claude, comment ça t'as ton couplet pour l'album, notre album?
Mmh mmh!
Mais attends, mais c'était pas prévu ça!
Bah si, depuis l'Épisode -1,
C'est bien clair et net que j'suis sur les albums avec vous?
T'en penses quoi?
Bah vas-y fais l'couplet, hein!
OK!

Han! Pour t'nettoyer l'visage, t'utilises le même gant d'toilette
Han! Pour ta réorientation en menuiserie, les profs ont pas mis d'gant d'toilette
Han! J'ai jamais pris d'cours de claquettes
Han! J'suis proprio d'une Ivan Lendl jacket
Han! Appelle-moi ""Tonton"" quand tu viens chercher l'Dragibus qu'est posé sur ma braguette
Han! Tu m'fais bomber l'calfouette
Han! Écœurante comme une fille mignonne qui fouette
Han! Mélange de Ricard et d'Powerade
Han! Un clochard agressif
Han! Un physique d'agriculteur
Han! Les Casseurs Flowters auront leur heure de gloire lorsqu'ils passeront sur Nostalgie

Casseurs Flowters ,"J'sais pas trop, c'est pas trop mon délire.
On en a déjà parlé plein d'fois,
Mais c'est la dernière fois qu'on a cette discussion.
Gringe, dis-nous ce que tu penses de la prostitution

Des fois tu trompes ta meuf, (Ouais) mais tu t'sens limité (Ouais)
Bah retiens ça, 50, c'est l'prix d'la tranquilité (Hein, 50?)
Le meilleur moyen de t'vider sans t'faire piquer
C'est certifié, penses-y avant d'critiquer
Fini les appels nocturnes, les numéros masqués
Le stress de t'faire péter chaque fois qu'tu l'as sentie vibrer
À toi qui as jamais su tricher sans t'justifier
Dis-toi qu'y'a que Jésus qu'a pas menti, résultat, crucifié (Amen)
Les putes c'est comme une séance chez l'psy, le p'tit plus
C'est qu'pour le même prix, t'as une personne qui t'consulte et qui t'suce
Sans barrière de langue, ni distinction d'âge
Moi j'avais même pas 20 ans, j'ai vite chopé l'virus
C'était la même chaque jour
J'élaborais des plans savants pour m'faufiler d'chez moi, jusqu'à ces J9 de l'amour
3h du mat' commence le compte à rebours
J'sors de ma chambre en prenant soin de respecter les étapes sur mon parcours
D'abord les poches de mon père, clés d'voiture
Puis passer par la fenêtre, sortir dehors, mettre les chaussures
Clé sur l'contact, attendre qu'une voiture passe
Camoufler l'bruit quand j'démarre
Rouler un peu plus loin pour mettre les phares
Puis direction la gare sans qu'on m'arrête, non, j'ai pas l'permis
Prise de risque maximale pour public averti
Ma première expérience dans un camtar, j'entends cette p'tite voix qui m'dit,
""Alors, une MST, c'est quoi Jamy?""
Tu trouves quand même des bonus compris dans l'prix d'vente
Kosovarde ou Béninoise, chope un master en langue vivante
Ressent des pulsions lancinantes
Une douce chaleur qui t'emplis l'ventre
Découvre un monde aux saveurs enivrantes
La sueur de quinze clients incrustée sur un matelas moite
Le parfum des lingettes pour bébé qu'elle se passe dans la chatte
Les lampes à pétrole, l'odeur du sperme
Les corbeilles pleines de capotes qui seront comptabilisées par un mac
Et pendant qu't'es là et qu'tu fais tes affaires
Une deuxième fille dors à l'avant, les putes travaillent souvent par paire
Crois-moi c'est l'genre de truc qui détendra même les plus complexés
Vive le camtar et sa promiscuité!
Y'a deux écoles, l'estafette ou l'hôtel
Aller chez l'habitant ou choisir l'ennui d'un voyage organisé
Vois pas les choses avec effroi
Dis-toi qu'les femmes ont besoin d'une raison pour l'faire
Nous, juste d'un endroit
Donc j'ai attendu là, tapi dans la pénombre
En attendant mon tour, j'angoisse et j'comptais les secondes
Excitation féconde, mais laisse-moi t'dire le plus kiffant
Une chance sur deux d'attraper l'DASS' si y'a plus d'lubrifiant
Et j'appelle ça l'amour du risque, explore ton côté sombre
Remonte le col de l'utérus plus vite que Lance Armstrong
Moi j'ai vite appris à calculer leurs vices, penses-tu
Ma bite coincée entre ses cuisses en période de menstru'
Mais j'flirte avec le sordide, j'me débine pas
J'sais qu'l'argent qu'j'lui file va servir à payer les couches et l'Blédina
Ne surtout pas tomber dans l'empathie, crois-moi
T'es dans la merde si tu commences à faire ton délicat
Là elle jouera sa carte fragile et consentante
Et toi, bah tu t'feras alléger les couilles et l'compte en banque
Et c'est une règle de base dans un rapport que tu monnayes,
Te laisse pas attendrir sous peine de t'faire soutirer plus d'oseille
1, Réprime ta morale
2, Assouvis tes pulsions
3, Découvre que rapport payé donne plus d'excitation
Impassible et stoïque, une pute n'éprouve pas d'émotion
Si tu l'as fais cligner d'un œil, t'as rempli ta mission
En résumé du sexe, du stress et des tas d'frissons
Le plus vieux métier du monde perpétue la tradition
En équipe, mieux qu'un Laser Quest, tu perds t'as plus qu'à faire l'test
Veinard si tu t'en tires juste avec un herpès
Les putes et moi, une grande histoire d'amour
Mes premiers émois, mes premiers exploits, premières tranches de bravoure
Combien d'fois j'ai fais l'tour du rond-point pour la quinzième fois
Toujours le même frisson quand j'parle des putes et moi

Alors, toujours pas convaincu?
Pff, j'suis toujours pas très chaud.
Bah vas-y, finis la discussion, Orel,
Dis-nous c'que tu penses de la prostitution!

J'entends souvent, ""Pour baiser, j'ai pas besoin d'payer""
C'est bien d'avoir sa fierté, moi j'l'ai fait
Avant 18 ans, j'osais pas tester
Comme j'habitais pas très loin, j'observais leurs vas-et-viens, j'rêvais
J'voyais des mecs perdus et des caisses de PDG
Des pères de familles prendre des putes avec leur siège bébé
C'est vrai, j'ai sauté quelques repas pour essayer
Comment c'était, à chier!
Chaque fois j'ai regretté
T'es loin du glamour de ""Pretty Woman""
Quand tu t'retrouves à rentrer mou dans une vessie toute crade
Quand l'odeur des types d'avant est limite soutenable
Quand tu comprends ""Casse-toi, connard!"", quand elle te dit, ""Good bye!""
J'suis rentré chez moi, plastique sur la bite, tout pâle
J'ai mis trois mois avant d'arrêter d'me sentir coupable
Et puis j'y suis retourné quelques fois pour vérifier
On m'a dit d'jamais resté bloqué sur mes premières idées
J'étais fixé, jean baissé entre deux pares-chocs
J'arrive à penser à rien d'autre qu'à l'accident d'capote
C'est qu'une grande carotte
Sauf si t'aimes les plans femmes mortes
En période de règles, supplément ketchup
J'aime les trucs sales dans des endroits propres
C'est tout l'contraire, les lingettes désinfectantes, ça m'bloque
Elles mettent tellement d'lubrifiant qu'tu peux rentrer sans qu'ça frotte
Autant tremper ta bite dans la flotte
Peu importe c'qu'elle fait avec ses mains, elle en à rien à branler
J'ai déjà pris plus de plaisir chez l'médecin
C'est bien si les putes t'excitent
Mais j'ai vu des bouchers découper des poulets d'une manière plus sexy
Si tu crois qu'une pute gémit, t'as du entendre un soupir
Si elle t'refile des chlamydias, tu repars avec un souvenir
Oublie tes fantasmes, elle s'en tape de tes problèmes sexuels
Les putes n'ont aucune conscience professionnelle
Quand elles s'écartent à moins d'un mètre pour aller pisser
Tu vois qu'le service après-vente laisse à désirer
J'm'en bats les couilles de leurs clichés plein d'préjugés
Mais c'est quand même bizarre de pénétrer les réfugiés
Bon, j'ai quand même tenté une autre approche
Nouveau compte en banque, nouvelle décadence
Nouvelle girlfriend expérience
Pour faire avancer la science
J'ai trouvé des sites d'escortes et j'ai tenté ma chance
Pour les plus bonnes, j'attends toujours qu'on m'rappelle
Pour les autres, tu connais l'expression, ""Photo non contractuelle""
La première était tellement moche, mon cœur s'est arrêté, AVC
Tu m'crois qu'j'l'ai baisée quand même pour pas la vexer?
Le temps d'digérer la honte et j'suis chez une femme ronde
Avec une sale tronche, qui veut qu'j'crache en trois secondes
Doit y avoir un chronomètre dans sa chatte blonde
C'est pas dans l'annonce qu'il fallait baiser contre-la-montre
Cette pouffe vénale gâche tout parce qu'elle joue très mal
Prends tes 200 balles et va t'payer des cours d'théâtre
C'est plus fort que moi, j'veux toujours qu'elles m'trouvent spécial
J'ai trop d'égo pour être un coup banal, j'fais tout l'travail
C'est elles qui devraient m'payer
J'essaie d'les mettre à l'aise au point qu'ça m'fait stresser
J'passe les trente premières minutes à bégayer
Quand j'lis les annonces et quand elles s'barrent, c'est mes moments préférés
Des trottoirs aux camtars, aux maisons closes, aux vitrines
Qu'elles arrêtent de s'plaindre, c'est toujours moi la victime
J'ai perdu beaucoup d'amour propre et un peu d'money
Quand j'suis à deux doigts d'craquer, j'me dis qu'la capote aussi
Les putes et moi, une suite d'histoires lamentables
Crois-moi, oublie les films de boule que t'as dans l'crâne
C'est qu'une grande arnaque ou p't-être que j'ai pas l'mental
Rendez-moi mes 50, mes 100, mes 300 balles

Les putes et moi, une grande histoire d'amour
Mes premiers émois, mes premiers exploits, premières tranches de bravoure
Combien d'fois j'ai fais l'tour du rond-point pour la quinzième fois

Ma meuf m'a dit d'changer d'ami parce qu'il m'tire vers le bas

Ma meuf m'a dit,
""Ton pote est vraiment trop con, il ramène ses poufs chez toi, dis-lui qu'il arrête
C'est qu'un trou noir
J'vois qu'il part avec tes fringues, et, c'est bizarre, mais j'le vois jamais revenir avec
Tu t'prends des droites
Parce qu'il attire les embrouilles, à chaque fois qu'ça part en couilles, il assume que dalle
Quand il débarque
C'est qu'il vient faire une machine ou qu'il a des trucs à mater sur le câble""

Ma meuf m'a dit,
""Ton pote, c'est vraiment un beauf, à chaque fois qu'il croise ma mère,
Il l'appelle ""Mademoiselle""
Il chante tout l'temps
Le problème, c'est qu'il est nul, mais il est persuadé d'avoir la voix d'Pharrell
C'est un clepto
La dernière fois qu'j'suis rentrée, il avait les deux mains plongées dans mon sac Chanel
Il trompe sa meuf
Quand vous traînez tous les deux, dis-moi c'qui m'empêche de croire qu'tu fais pas pareil""

Tous les jours, ma meuf me prend la tête avec ce genre de dicton
J'vais finir par vivre avec mon pote, et puis c'est tout

""Traîne avec des millionnaires, t'as des chances d'attraper des millions
Traîne avec des pouilleux, t'as des chances d'attraper des poux""
Tous les jours, ma meuf me prend la tête avec ce genre de dicton
J'vais finir par vivre avec mon pote, et puis c'est tout

""Casse-toi si t'es pas contente, tu sais comment ça va finir si t'augmentes de trop
Pour qui tu t'prends?
Toutes tes copines sont à chier, même toi, tu les aimes pas vraiment, tu parles dans leur dos""
""Hey, mais n'importe quoi, t'as pas du tout dit ça, hein""
En fait, j'ai dit,
""Bébé, tu peux pas m'quitter, tu sais, j'ferai toujours passer notre amour avant lui
T'es ma moitié
Plus jamais j'te partagerai, ce soir, c'est la dernière fois, poupée, j'te l'garantis""

Casseurs Flowters ,"Est-ce qu'il y a une drogue pour m'apaiser?
Une drogue assez puissante ou une parole pour me rassurer
Quand je suis dans mes phases délirantes?
Est-ce que le réconfort d'un pote ou celui d'une femme séduisante
Pourrait m'éloigner ou même me guérir d'un passé qui me hante?
Et j'ai vraiment tout essayé, loin d'une vie trépidante, rongé
Des nuits blanches à m'demander d'une voix hésitante,
""Ai-je fais les bons choix?""
Prise de conscience froide et flippante
Des fois j'aimerai m'endormir et m'réveiller l'année suivante mais
Renferme les problèmes sous une chape de plomb
Quand ils remontent en surface souvent la peur te paralyse
Alors l'angoisse frappe comme une lame de fond
Fait qu'aujourd'hui j'me Jack Danise encore et qu'la psy m'analyse
Tellement de fois j'ai chéri mes démons pour qu'ils reviennent
À m'esquinter, sans m'interroger sur la vie qu'je mène
Si j'emmène avec moi ces fous rires, ces souvenirs de scènes
J'ai négligé ma famille et même perdu la fille que j'aime

Et si, plus tard
On voulait connaître mes histoires
Combien vaudront, vraiment la peine d'être racontées?
Même si, ce soir
J'suis touché parce qu'il est tard
Demain j'aurais, sûrement déjà tout oublié

Et j'cours entre deux trains, m'essouffle entre deux refrains
C'est nous l'futur, c'est nous les ringards de demain
Plus tu tapes fort, plus t'as des chances de t'péter la main
La plupart des choses sur lesquelles je me suis construit servent à rien
Quand les gamins font des gamins
Personne contrôle, c'est la loi d'l'évolution
Tu crèves si tu joues pas l'bon rôle
Et j'flippe à n'en plus pouvoir trembler
J'ai jouis à n'en plus pouvoir bander
Reste à voir qui va m'planter
D'ailleurs j'le f'rai sûrement moi-même
Rattrape-moi, j'ai plongé sans voir les piques devant la scène
On a gravi des sommets, bâtit des projets
Ravis des trophées, affligés, choqués
J'manque de certitude pour être un artiste révolté
J'regarde plus loin, machine et progrès
J'entends mon heure sonner, alors j'fais l'inventaire
J'f'rai tout pour ne jamais devenir un cinquantenaire pommé

Et si, plus tard
On voulait connaître mes histoires
Combien vaudront, vraiment la peine d'être racontées?
Même si, ce soir
J'suis touché parce qu'il est tard
Demain j'aurais, sûrement déjà tout oublié

Tu t'vois en haut d'l'affiche, ça y est tu mènes la vie d'artiste
Toi qu'as toujours voulu faire parti des finalistes
Ça y est tout l'monde te r'garde, exhibe tes cicatrices
Mais c'est déjà trop tard, sans l'savoir tu quittes la piste
Les mêmes gens qui t'aimaient maintenant te jugent et te stigmatisent
T'en as rien à foutre puisque personne ne rivalise
Mais quand le rideau tombe et qu'ta conscience te tyrannise
Tu sais qu'celui qui vit comme un égoïste finira triste

Les erreurs font les remords et les hommes apprennent en grandissant
Les mauvais sentiments viennent t'attirer vers l'anéantissement
Comme beaucoup d'gens d'mon âge, j'suis rongé par la culpabilité
J'ai toujours tout fait pour esquiver les responsabilités
J'ai souvent choisi d'me taire au moins j'étais sur de pas m'tromper
Mais les années passent vite et même les plus grands finissent par tomber
Dans toutes nos aventures, beaucoup d'moments finiront par compter
Si j'dois m'en aller, j'rêverai d'avoir plus d'histoires à raconter

Et si, plus tard
On voulait connaître mes histoires
Combien vaudront, vraiment la peine d'être racontées?
Même si, ce soir
J'suis touché parce qu'il est tard
Demain j'aurais, sûrement déjà tout oublié

Reste, encore des bornes à faire
Si tu regardes en arrière
Ne vois pas qu'le vide
Te casse pas trop vite
Attends parce qu'il nous reste
Encore des bornes à faire
Si tu regardes en arrière
Ne vois pas qu'le vide
Te casse pas trop vite
Attends parce qu'il nous reste

Tu peux m'trouver sur un téton comme un poupon trentenaire
J'opère en vacances, en carence, en latence
J'suis toujours trois d'tens' comme si j'étais sous mescaline
Des sirènes aux thons, j'baise toutes sortes d'espèces marines
Queue mécanique, Winter le dauphin, sex machine
J'opère en puissance, en nuisance, en silence
J'opère en kickant, sans freelance, j'vais t'mettre la pige
Quand j'étais p'tit, j'fantasmais sur ""J'aime la gym""
J'rajoute un peu d'blanc dans ta belle chabine
On viens tronçonner ton arbre généalogique
T'as pas compris, on t'baise à la racine
J'dors dans la cabine, j'fais des micro-siestes
Au paradis, 2Pac et Biggie récitent nos textes
Dis à tes twittos de rejoindre la Team Valium
À part dormir et faire la sieste, y'a rien qui m'passionne
J'ressors à bord d'une ambulance quand j'vais au Gymnasium
E-cigarettes branchées, mon Mac c'est une chicha pomme
""This is the best I ever had""
J'me prends pour Drake quand j'enregistre mes yaourts sur dictaphone
Orel, Gringe et Skread c'est Dewey, Reese, Malcolm
Les MC partent en thérapie à la sortie d'l'album
Moins et moins ça fait plus et plus, deux frères d'un autre utérus
J'sais pas quelle connerie j'vais faire, prépare quand même une excuse
Alcool pur et dur, j'suis ton gars, plus très sûr
Tu repars en fauteuil roulant, Ben Hur

J'suis curieux, ma conscience dit toujours, ""Pourquoi pas ?""
Tu m'vois pas dans la boîte, c'est qu'j'suis sous la table
Ou la la, c'est l'bordel, dans ma tête, tout va mal
C'est la Chandeleur en concert, on retourne toute la salle
Who's back, douchebag, j'envois la douche froide
On arrive en aquaplaning dans ta bourgade
Un déluge de conneries s'abat sur ta do-rag
Travaux forcés pour tes rappeurs, c'est retour au goulag
J'viens surfer sur la vague, encore un blanc qui rappe
Raelsan en feat, j'pars avec un handicap
Gringe est dans l'réseau, un peu comme ces gens qui hackent
Perroquet sur l'épaule, téléchargement pirate (Stupide, stup')
Attends, j'ai encore deux-trois phases au chaud
On t'greffe un frère siamois homo
Tu peux rien faire pour l'éviter pourtant tu vois l'poteau
Levez les bras pour Satanas et Diabolo!

Winter the dauphin, c'est l'dauphin qu'est, tu sais,
Qui s'est retrouver dans un casier à crabes,
Il s'est blessé dans l'truc, il a perdu sa queue,
Et du coup ils l'ont transporté à l'hôpital Clearwater pour espèces marines là,
Il a été rebaptisé Winter, et euh, en fait, euh,
Si il perd sa queue il risque de mourir, du coup ils lui ont,
Ils lui ont fabriqué une queue en, une queue en, une queue mécanique quoi,
Une queue en métal, d'où la phase Winter le dauphin, queue mécanique,
Sex machine

Quand l'Bois d'Cergy tout entier était mon terrain d'jeu
Sous mon blouson starter, toujours à la recherche d'une connerie à faire
Et j'y retournerais si j'pouvais faire un vœu
Si dehors j'suis seul, à la maison une femme m'éduque
Mais déjà trop dissipé, j'fuis les salles d'études
On s'bousille à Tekken quand on s'entasse chez Luc
Et en bas d'l'école des Maradas, j'marque des buts
Avec Karl, Nordine, Mouss, David, Fabio, Ayoub
Christophe Leblaye, Steph et Chicano
Ici tout l'monde se connaît, chacun à son équipe
Donc mieux vaut marcher en bande et connaître ses répliques
J'repense aux barres de rire dans l'hall de Pierrick
Les mercredis foot en salle, vitesse technique
Ici trop d'têtes rasées, mecs cramés
Si t'es blanc, ramène des chips au bacon pour pas t'faire taxer
Lycée rime avec mauvais points
J'vais en cours pour élaborer toutes sortes de sèches
Daniel me roule mes premiers joints
J'rentre chez moi les yeux vitreux et la gorge sèche
Première, parano, merde
Grillé par la mère quand elle m'fait cracher dans l'lavabo
Cachette cramée, mon shit fini au camion-benne
J'me revois encore traîner avec Luigi aux Trois-Fontaines
Puis des étangs à Cergy Village
Flashback, soufflette
Musique rap, city stade, roulette
Non, mes traces au Posca n'sont pas qu'des phrases toutes faites
Gringe est dans la place pour être",20h08 - Dans la place pour être,2013

C'est quoi les news, déboule en pass Navigo V12
Arrive en califourchon sur un triple Magnum de Grey Goose
Un gros Reebok sur les shoes
Chérie, j'veux juste baiser,
Me raconte pas ta life comme si tu voulais que j't'épouse
Tu crois encore au prince charmant, lance un appel d'offre
Cherche-le sur ""Les Copains d'Avant"", lance un appel d'offre
Face caméra, j'vomis mes tripes, comme David Hasselhoff
Gringe a signé sur Label 5, Mazel Tov
Si tu fumes pendant les concerts, on vient slammer sur ton smartphone
Ces artistes de merde vont bientôt chanter les Droits d'l'Homme
Même chez l'marchand d'glaces, tu pourrais pas payer ton Magnum
Si j'trouve personne, j'mettrais ma bite dans une calzone
Blanc avec une attitude, qu'Eazy-E m'pardonne
Y'a d'quoi m'attirer des procès dans mon dictaphone
J'ai du mal à conduire quand j'écoute la musique, sale conne
Oui, t'es bloqué, mais sois dans les temps quand tu klaxonnes

Klaxonne
Klaxonne

Gringe fait l'ours avec des écolières, PedoBear
J'glisse dans ta bouche sans prévenir, comme tes premières prémolaires
J'vais prendre l'argent du rap, et m'arracher à Buenos Aires
Si tu m'cherches, j'serai joignable sur mon numéro vert
J'me suis fait tellement recaler,
J'aime faire la fête que devant les discothèques
J'écoute jamais deux choses, tes sons et c'que les filles promettent
J'arrive, bandoulière à l'épaule, équipé d'mignonettes
Laisse nos Pokéballs, c'est l'retour de la Team Rocket
Mailler pour garder la vie sauve
Ne plus passer des chattes aux femmes cougars dans mes nuits fauves
J'essaye encore!

J'rappe pas, j'pontifie
Pousse le cerveau des fidèles qui s'zombifient
Mode de vie nul et connexion wi-fi

J'lève mon verre au prochain paiement qu'on va faire en cinq fois
Fermez vos gueules quand j'cause, whisky, Coca, Mentos
Tous les coups sont permis, j'fais l'grand écart à la Jean-Claude
J'excelle pas dans grand-chose, à part dans les temps d'pause
J'ferai couler ta boîte avant la fin d'l'entretien d'embauche

Bonjour les amis, je reviens d'un vernissage avec Stanislas,
Non sérieux, ça va les mecs ou pas?
Ouais ça va et toi?
Bof pas terrible, parce que j'voudrais pas vous faire chier,
Avec les problèmes qui s'passent au Moyen-Orient actuellement.
Ouais.
Mais là il nous reste plus qu'une demi heure pour qu'on s'éclate la tête à l'happy hour!
Ah merde, putain, comment c'est passé vite!
Et on s'est pris une heure et demi dans la tronche, qu'on retrouvera ap'.
Une heure et demi en moins sur l'apéro.
Et voilà!
Bah t'sais quoi?
On a qu'a éclater tes 24 bières que t'as ramenées avant d'y aller!
Nan, hors de question, parce que quand on va être cramés mon pote,
On va pas s'prendre l'inflation des épiceries de nuit, hors de question,
C'est l'paquet survie, celui-ci!
On va prendre quatre pintes d'Embuscade et un RedBull banane, s'il vous plait!
Bah ouais, y'a des gars c'est des oufs,
T'sais qu'David Bowie, il paraît qu'il allait tester chaque nouveau morceau
Dans l'bar du coin devant les pochtrons et tout!
Mais allez-y, mais allez-y, y'a tout c'qu'il faut,
Y'a les platines, y'a les micros, allez-y s'il vous plaît!
De quoi qu'on aille chanter là maintenant?
Bah ouais mais allez-y, non franchement allez-y!
Ça fait longtemps qu'vous avez pas fait ça!
Nan, nan, franchement, nan, nan en plus c'est bon public et tout!
T'sais quoi, on y va si tu fais les backs!
Y'a pas d'soucis, vas-y c'est parti, on y va!

Tu supportes pas qu'on t'chambre, souvent ça part en baston
Tu cognes en premier, juste après tu demandes pardon, ouais
Quand elle cherche à t'exciter, t'essayes de l'esquiver

Tu mens jamais mais tu dis pas vraiment la vérité

J'attend qu'elle m'quitte, les bras croisés en attendant la suite
En attendant la fuite, j'attend la gloire, j'attend qu'elle m'bipe
Incapable de faire des choix j'suis comme mes figurines
Inutile, j'reste chez moi, j'baisse les bras
Inachevés
Un prototype une version beta
Une seule réponse à toutes les questions ""j'sais pas""
Comme un constat d'échec dans la playlist
Comme un air d'abandon sur la setlist
J'fais rien à fond donc j'serais qu'à moitié triste
Et à l'image de tout c'que j'ai fait jusqu'à maintenant j'vais même pas finir mon couplet

Pourquoi quand elle m'attend sagement j'passe toutes mes nuits à jouer?
Pourquoi est ce que je l'évite lâchement quand j'la sens tiraillée?
J'trouve pas les réponses p't'être que j'suis comme Mario
La tête dans les nuages à la recherche d'une vie cachée
J'compte plus mes relations inachevées
Meuf ou branlette améliorée j'fais pas la diff' donc elle me quitte fachée
J'ai essayé d'changer les choses d'lui dire avec des roses
La sauver d'mes névroses mais comme les études ça m'est vite passé
Et j'ressens comme un vide Inachevé Inachevé
J'ai jamais rien fini sauf c'que j'ai entrepris d'gacher
Complètement détaché j'mécoute raconter des histoires
Le monde peut bien m'attendre même si j'suis tout seul à y croire
Faudrait qu'on s'pose et qu'on discute
Qu'on discute ? Ouais on verra ça demain là j'vais rejoindre mes potes c'est jeudi soir
Mode de vie nul, j'avale la pilule tristement
Admettre la vérité j'refuse, j'me monte des complots
Longtemps que j'simule persuadé que j'fixe le temps
Incapable de voir que tous mes refuges sont mes tombeaux

Long à la détente, mauvais sur la longueur
A quelques millièmes de secondes de laisser passer mon heure
La tête plein d'doute à confondre rien foutre avec patience
J'te parle pas d'galanterie quand j'dis que j'laisse plus passer ma chance
La médiocrité commence là où les passions meurent
C'est bête mais j'ai besoin de cette merde pour sentir battre mon cœur
J'ai tellement misé sur mes faiblesses et mes failles
J'mérite une médaille au final j'ai fait qu'briller par mes absences
Tu parles de quoi ? J'te parle de moi, j'te parle de faire des choix
Si tu renonces à rien tu choisis pas faut que j'me barre de là
Et on parle et on parle de partir pendant qu'on reste là
Mais si on s'tire c'est vers le bas on s'y fait on vit presque pas
A partir de maintenant j'commence mon ascension
J'ai plus peur du vide, d'affronter la spirale sans fond
Donc j'arrête d'arrêter, j'abandonne l'abandon
Si j'dois finir une seule chose c'est cette putain d'chanson

Et c'est la première mesure de ma vie d'après
Et ça fait 15 ans qu'tout monde dit ""ça va lui passer""
Mais si t'écoute les personnes qui dorment les rêves n'arrivent jamais
J'veux pas vieillir blasé à 50 piges passées l'envie d'claquer
Alors j'lacherai mes derniers flows jusqu'à finir déshydraté
Et si l'envie d'tout foutre en l'air se pointe dis lui d'rappeller
Si jamais la cabine explose J'rapperai même sous une pluie d'acier
J'finirai d'écrire en m'entaillant les veines sur un vitre cassée
Si la mort frappe à ma porte me dit ""T'es dans mes p'tits papiers""
Dis lui d'revenir après, dis lui d'jarter, dis lui d'venir backer
Ou laisse moi lui dire ""Ferme ta gueule j'ai pas fini d'rapper
J'partirai jamais en laissant l'histoire inachevée",Inachevés,2015

Tu vois pas qu'ils veulent être toi, même pendant quelques secondes
Qu'il rêvent de fame en priant pour que la tienne retombe
Tu seras du-per, toi qui rêvais d'être dans la lumière
Comme si c'est nous qu'allions de faire de l'ombre
Ouais on est tes potes, mais bon tu changes de cap
Tu nous mets sur la touche maintenant que tous ces gens te flattent
J'suis pas là pour critiquer ni t'apprendre le rap

C'est l'heure pour aller jouer
Regarde comme il fait chaud dehors
Faut sortir s'aérer
Je m'en bats les couilles!

Abattu par la fatigue d'avoir rien branlé
Le projet c'était d'rien foutre, et j'ai aucun plan B
J'pense qu'à glander, chanter, m'esquinter la santé
Mon cochon d'Inde est mort de faim, j'lui donnais rien à manger
Quinze appels manqués, rappelle-moi d'jamais les rappeler
Aucun objectif, j'suis sûr de pas les rater!
J'écris jamais d'chanson, j'suis sûr de pas les rapper
J'suis fakir, j'marche pieds nus sur des assiettes cassées
Il m'reste qu'une barre d'énergie, ça sent la panne de réseau
Tu viens d'finir tes exos, j'finis ma boîte de Lexo
J'vis dans mon dix mètres carré, carrelage couvert de crasse
Si j'prends l'balai, c'est juste pour changer la poussière de place

Regarde comme il fait beau dehors (Pff, ouais, ouais)
C'est l'heure pour aller jouer (Je m'en bats les couilles!)
Regarde comme il fait chaud dehors
Faut sortir s'aérer (Pff, non!)

J'vis en marge, plus ça va, plus j'me détache
Déchiré sur les photos, même sur l'périph', j'souris quand y'a les flashs
J'frôle la syncope, tise à m'en rendre malade
Au réveil le p'tit déj', c'est une fin d'clope et une part de pizza froide
Fatigué, j'trouve même plus la force de m'ennuyer
Tout c'qui traîne peut devenir un cendrier
On est resté bloqué sur les vieilles vannes de lycée
Si t'as pas d'nouvelles histoires, on va les remasteriser
J'veux qu'on m'foute la paix, j'dors, j'provoque la chance
J'suis à l'autre bout du canapé sur les photos d'vacances
J'avance avec un fort taux d'latence
J'me réveille à midi, j'ai la gaule à 18

Bonjour, j'ai une quatre-saisons et une calzone, c'est ici?

Tu peux garder la monnaie, j'ai mal au crâne quand j'calcule
Des pizzas, des films bizarres, des femmes, des tentacules
J'allume une clope, et pense à celle d'après pendant qu'j'la fume
Comme une pucelle dans un gang-bang, j'en branle pas une
J'prends l'évolution dans l'sens contraire, j'végète
J'descends même plus mes poubelles, j'les lance par les fenêtres
J'ai la flemme de nettoyer mes fringues, j'les jette
J'ai des portraits d'mes ex, on fera des parties d'fléchettes
""Un t-shirt propre qui traîne"" égale ""nouvelle taie d'oreiller""

E penínsulas e oceanos que não vão secar

Que era certo em ferro e chumbo
Que era reto, enxergo curvo
Porque a era do futuro
Você trouxe pra mim infernal

É céu, não acaba, achava que era o chão

Só o cheiro do seu cheiro

Não consegue ser tão fugaz
Nas pessoas, peles, colos
Sexo, bocas, onde nunca estás

Você partiu e foi melhor
E eu já me esqueci de cor
Do som, do ar, do tom, da voz e de nós

Já passei um pano um branco, um zero, um xis
Um traço, um tempo, já passei
Só o cheiro do seu cheiro
Não consigo deixar para trás
Impregnado o dia inteiro
Nessa roupa que eu não tiro mais

Cássia Eller,"Tava com cara que carimba postais
E por descuido abriu uma carta que encontrou
Tomou um susto que lhe abriu a boca
Esse recado veio pra mim, não pro senhor
Recebo crack, colante, dinheiro farto embrulhado
Em papel carbono e barbante e até cabelo cortado
Retrato de 3x4 pra batizado distante
Mas isso aqui, meu senhor, é uma carta de amor

Levo o mundo e não vou lá
Levo o mundo e não vou lá
Levo o mundo e não vou lá
Levo o mundo e não vou lá

Mas este cara tem a língua solta
A minha carta ele musicou
Tava em casa, a vitamina pronta
Ouvi no rádio a minha carta de amor
Dizendo ""eu caso contente, papel passado e presente desembrulhado
Vestido, eu volto logo me espera
Não brigue nunca comigo eu quero ver nosso filho

Dona dos meus olhos é você, avião no are
Um dia pr'esses olhos sem te ver é como o chão do mar
Liga o rádio a pilha e a TV só pra você escutar...

A nova música que eu fiz agora
Lá fora a rua vazia chora

Os meus olhos vibram ao te ver, são dois fãs, um par
Pus nos olhos vidros pra poder melhor te enxergar
Luz dos olhos, para anoitecer é só você se afastar
Pinta os lábios para escrever a tua boca em mim...

Que a nossa música eu fiz agora
Lá fora a Lua irradia a glória

E eu te chamo
Eu te peço vem
Diga que você me quer porque eu te quero também

Faço as pazes lembrando
Passo as tardes tentando lhe telefonar
Cartazes te procurando
Aeronaves seguem pousando sem você desembarcar

Pra eu te dar a mão nessa hora
Levar as malas pro fusca lá fora

E eu vou guiando
Eu te espero, vem
Siga onde vão meus pés porque eu te sigo também

E não sinto nem mais frio,

E o que os olhos não veem

Mesmo na saudade
Você não está ausente

E em cada beijo seu
E em cada estrela do céu
E em cada flor no campo
E em cada letra no papel

E a luz dos seu cabelo

De enfeites, brochinhos e queixas
Queixas, queixas, queixas
Foi você mesma quem quis

Foi você quem quis ir embora
Agora toca a campainha e cora
Diz que esqueceu a sacola
Baby, eu conheço essa história

O cara já está buzinando lá embaixo
Fazendo papel de palhaço
Cheio de flores, promessas

¡Menina mimada, você é um fracasso!
¿Cigarros?
Leva o maço
Foi você mesma quem quis

",Menina Mimada,2006
Cássia Eller,"Você na multidão, você é diferente
As suas mãos me acenam
Não parecem ter morrido
Cheias de presentes, caixas coloridas

Trouxe uma orelha
Envolta num pano vermelho
É a prova, meu amor
Me espera sem uma orelha

Vou correndo, vou agora
Resgatar o meu amor
No asfalto quente
Do aeroporto

Como uma miragem
É a alma que castiga o corpo
Esta é a mensagem
Na paisagem distorcida
Pelos aviões que sobem

Você voltou pra me ajudar
E eu fico mais feliz
Mas ainda não estamos salvos
O ar está pesado

Não é só a cicatriz
Que identifica o ser amado
¡Temos que ter idéias juntos!
¡Temos que achar uma maneira!
É que agora está chovendo uma chuva sem vento

E há meia hora ventava
Vamos fugir pra dentro
Há meia hora ventava e tínhamos coragem
E eu já estou cansado de não gostar de mim

",A Orelha de Euridice,2006
Cássia Eller,"Benzinho, eu ando pirado
Rodando de bar em bar
Jogando conversa fora
Só pra te ver passando, gingando

Me encarando, me enchendo de esperança
Me maltratando a visão
Girando de mesa em mesa
Sorrindo pra qualquer um
Fazendo cara de fácil, é

Jogando duro com o coração, gracinha
Todo mundo tem um ponto fraco
¿Você é o meu, por que não?
¿Você é o meu, por que não?

Cássia Eller,"Eu quero a sorte de um amor tranquilo
Com sabor de fruta mordida
Nós na batida no embalo da rede
Matando a sede na saliva

Ser teu pão
Ser tua comida
Todo o amor que houver nessa vida
E algum trocado pra dar garantia

E ser artista no nosso convívio
Pelo inferno e céu de todo dia
Pra poesia que a gente nem vive
Transformar o tédio em melodia

Ser teu pão
Ser tua comida
Todo o amor que houver nessa vida
E algum veneno anti monotonia

E se eu achar a tua fonte escondida
Te alcanço em cheio mel e a ferida
E o corpo inteiro como um furacão
Boca, nuca, mão e a tua mente não

Ser teu pão

E algum remédio que me de alegria

Sei também que você...

I continue to expose you niggas that's so superficial
I script you your obituary then blow like a missile
Once I blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you
Come with a style, I'm wildin', pile up my money so kosher,
Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover
Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the costa rica area level, 
My features and carry my posters

While helpin' you grow up, niggas know you for soundin' so tore up

I lock a strip and chop a brick like I'm Mr. Miyagi
But this ain't karate, I been sick since I pissed in a potty
I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy
I'm a cannon man
Holdin' the hamma man
For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man
Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker
I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers
And I do crimes for the bread like croutons
With two nines I be layin' clowns down like foutons
With the bullets in the rocket, my pockets is full of cream
I'm blowin' steam keep the steel in my hands like wolverine

Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level
I'm locking the kettle man, I'm hot like the pot and the kettle
On the mic I spaz, who get it hype as cass

I'm a fetus that survived an abortion, I won't be kilt (killed)
I'm the heart of Brooklyn, New York, I'm bedstuy
I'm a christian woman's hand on the bible I won't lie
I'm the code of silence in the gotti crew
I'm an empty mag right after a shootout, I just bodied you
Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you
Like kamakize through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back
Cause she was sittin' on my lap
I stay with the oowap strap
I put your baby daddy in a body bag
When I squeeze and let the wop clap
I Baghdad like Iraq

This is my era, you niggas is losers
I'm the new era(error) like a mistake on your computer
Got the infrared dot, bustin' you gullible suckers too
But a dot on your ass like www

Rip some pieces of niggas, we got 'card with us

What more can we say' Stop grillin'
'Fore you get hit up, shot up good
We'll murk you in your hood

I'm El Patreno, Nas the God, you lose your life
Whether on the corner or clubs, I'm shootin' dice
Break my cipha, I'll make it at you, slice you
Knife you, stab you, shank you, splat ya

Too many rappers is jealous, who be gassin' the fellows
Bunch of actors who never sold a crack in the ghetto
Went from Nas to The Esco, back to nasty
Clappin' that black heat

Nowadays, I'm on some mack shit
But I used to be loyal to tax, cracks
The nigga that would soil in your jacks
Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs
Coke so bright, it shine like white gold

And the hoes like Joe way before this rap shit
Before the Versace floors and the Rolls to match it
Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap
Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet

Don't front for me, you kids is not ballin'
If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan'
Ties swollen for no man with bold plans
Sick of this rap shit, why' Listen to 'Slow Jams'

I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip
Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss the fifth
Dogs, you's a bitch, I'm here to bring you a muzzle
Saying I'm peepin', I'ma bring you a muzzle
Get the point, general

It's Cassidy, I get rock like a boat when you go fishin'
Ayo, listen, I'm the general like Tso Shim Shin
I'm so sick, you can tell by the expression on my face
That I'll get in that ass like preparation H

The weapon on the waist and I spray guns off
'Cause if it's beef, I'ma be on top of it like A-1 sauce
Pause, now who the truth' Me, who quick to shoot' Me
My four-fifth got kick like Bruce Lee

See, I'm a true G, hotter than soup be
Raw like sushi, you gotta salute me
You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you
I'll let the water boil, cook a quarter to the oil

I had it for sell but y'all fagots would tell
Go to jail and start singin' like Patti LaBelle
I ain't gon' back in a cell, you rat and you did
Fuck a vest, put a bulletproof hat on your head

When I'm clappin' the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say he not the feds, then I'm servin' the nigga
I'm thirsty for the change, playin' games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now

I got that coke and that haze on my gristle now
We goin' to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwin' missiles 'round, you still tryin' to get a nine'
Uh, it's the last days, end of time

The terrorists jackin' planes, sendin' bombs to the Pentagon
They off the hook like intercoms
We just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil' when it's dinnertime

You still spendin' time focusin' on dumb shit
On the block smokin' but you broken on some bum shit

I keep it as raw as you seen it before it was put on the boat
The hookers'll open they jaw for free
Fuck being a gentleman, ya girlfriend open the door for me
When a pimp walk the beat, you shut up one day
The day the dick had ya mother next up one way

Make beef and I'm cookin the sauce - Gravy!

Come through in the spit white 330 with a mean birdie
Holdin my hammer cause she know its dirty
You got questions, holla at me - I tell you what's what
Lay you on ya back and y'all chumps'll really see what's up
On the real, y'all niggaz better chill
Think ya crew spittin flames - I'll put ya hot dogs on the grill
It gotta be a conspiracy if niggaz ain't feelin me
Like a nigga with no eyes - y'all not seein me
Call me a director - I give clips to ya broad
Bullets is like gum - How they stick in ya jaw
Go 'head, call the narcs - I put a hole through ya heart
And leave you on the train tracks in a shopping cart
This ain't just beats and bars, Its things I'll do to you
In Compton fuck, I'm tryin to get through to you

And them ATL niggaz show me love too
They ladies act crazy when the club do, show me love boo
This for my collie cats
My Baltimore stashin' the ollie cats
From Florida back up to D.C
And Virginia sendin' love when they see me, and that's for GP
I send the rest out
To any other place that I left out
From the north to the east to the west south
Cassidy gone rep 'till he repped out, until he repped out
Yeah yeah

Ayo, what'chu know 'bout this world I'm in
Every night I twist up and get drunk 'til I hurl again
Then I'll pour some more and start twirlin' then
And might go and get my pipes up by your girl and them
If you a thug, stop girlin' then
If I see a car in traffic, I'm a jacket like Burlington
It's Cassidy, who's thorough as him, nobody
I keep a gun tucked cause I don't trust nobody
I got plenty biscuits
And ya'll niggaz like skinny bitches y'all ain't got nobodies
Watch how you talk to me man
Before you faggots get smacked with the dark skin part of my
Hand
Understand?

I'm the best in building, a prospect destined for millions
Threat to civilians and my blood pressure is building
Catch feelings? You be wet, catchin' a steel in
Weapons directed, at ya' chest, neck and ya' grill and
Still, there's no regrets, but I confessed that I kill men
I spill men's blood on the rug next to there children
And if you wan' set it? Cass' bettin' his deal in
Yes I will win, when I spill extra appealin'
Come to Limekill, we got them exstasy pills and
Got the whip fully equipped except for the ceilin'
I got a stash in it, the Smith-n-Wessun can chill in
I might get arressted, but until then?

If I hear you gettin' chips, pitbulls where you sleepin'
Everybody on the fuckin' floor, I'm squeezin'
Click the four, grip your whore by her weave and
Bitch, what muthafuckin' drawer is the keys in?
Got you on your knees like a braud and you pleadin'
(Uh, you got it dog, take it all, I don't need it)
I'll clap you and have you on your carpet, bleedin'
Throw your stuff in the trunk of the Ford then I'm leavin'
Now I got a raw load more than I'm needin'
And that's the reason, why you and whore is screamin'
Pull this, squeezed then if you holdin' them hammers

'Cause I'll look good, and I'm good person to know

[Female Voice:] I'd like to make sweet love to you
[Cassidy:] What you say you tryin' to do, huh?
[C:] I'll make you scream like
[F:] AHHH!
[C:] And shout like
[F:] AHHH!

[C:] Now what you say?
[F:] I'd like to make sweet love to you

[Repeat]

[Verse 1 (Cassidy)]
Okay!
I was told you ain't got it nice, 'til you got a wife
But nope I'ma baller 'cause, never gon fall in love
Pshyche that's a damn lie
Ladies put ya hands high every woman should get that one man to stand by
It's called devotion, emotions could make a man cry
But ma wipe ya tears and just stare in that man eyes
Prove that you there for him, prove that you care for him
That's how you gotta act, prove that you got his back
Prove that you not a rat
Don't creep and ho around, hold him down
'Cause you know what comes around goes around
And I'm older now and it might seem kinda weird
But man all them damn AIDS commercials got me kinda scared

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 (Snoop Dogg)]
You ever laid on some pink mink sheets blowin' swishers
Holdin' on some champagne while doin ya damn thang
Caressin' on tha world main
Adressin'' you is no pain
Betty Wright is playing, no pain no gain
I did it for the hell of it
Hit it now you tell a bitch
Now she want a little bit, I did it for the smell of it
It's relevant and evident
Yeah girl you heaven sent
I love the way you break and take all the evidence
Pimpin cause I'm stayin in your mothafucking residence
While you out bringin me back the dead presidents
(Pimpin', Pimpin', Pimpin')
You can say that I got you
I do it cause I have to, plus I feel like I got you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 (Cassidy)]
Sis if you make love to me
Kissin' and huggin' me
Lickin' and rubbin' me, it'll get ugly
The bed got a mink spread gettin all cuddley
Pop bub' the hot tub gettin all bubbley
You don't even gotta ask, all my girls got it bad
Closet full of Prada bags and I ain't even gotta brag
Yeah I keep them lookin real
Go 'head you can push the wheel
And if ya face tough I might wake up and cook a meal
Whatever you ask for (It's yours)
We can go to my bungalo over in Tahiti with the glass floors
Fish swimmin 'round, the moonlight shimmer down
I got the bomb stroke
Girl get ya spine broke

[Chorus Until Fade]",Make U Scream,2004
Cassidy,"Okay. This joint is knockin' right here
I don't even need to write to this joint this easy
I'mma just talk to 'em off the top, listen

My interpretation of what the game facin'
I'm basin' my facts on ancient civilization
And my proclamation plus the world and its foundation
My education is statin' black unification
Debatin' whether Satin is situatin'
And placin' me in a state of mind that can't be shaken
It's like a leech slurrin' my specch, energy taken
It's brakin' my fiberglass thoughts that pass through my mental
Lettin' off frustration through meditation in conventional
Dimension in teleportation
And like the length between words in the first grade my mind is spacin'
Out on route like telephone communications through nations
Give me 360 degree rotations my occupation
Spittin' flows and creatin' a creation through experimental situations
They drug me 'cause my thoughts bloody like menstruations
Makin' my temperature heat up like incubation
They tracin' and chasin' from location to location
I'm stationed at a hotel accomidation
Waitin' to start me and my squad organization
But I'm hesitatin', too many outside irritations
Makin' me pause and might cause altercations
But I'm penetratin', surpassin' so-called limitations
Dedication, motivation and concentration
Manifestation is the key to escalation
And fluctuation of cheese might cause MC's suffocation
Or tax on cats 'cause no jacks is bein' fakin'
They typically pissin' me off like urination
Deflation and toleration is in consideration
But me in my rankin' is like Bob Marley to Jamaicans
I might be...slightly exaggeratin' but eliminatin'
These snakes wit affiliation got the system scared
Like mice durin' extermination
Erasin' the rhymes rapper's lines wit time and patience
Takin' no shorts, thoughts like woo blunts I'm lacin'
Comin' down like condensation givin' proper information
My interpretation of the rap business
Since my christenin' I wanted to be a rap technician
Splittin' mics in half for my fans when I'm spittin'
Never forgettin' how rap started from the beginnin'
But most of these ignorant rappers talkin' 'bout money they gettin'
Bars they spittin', cars they whippin', nice clothes they dipped in
Hoes they hittin', 9's they grippin'
But they gotta expand they mind and rhyme somethin' different
For instance, that's what I be kickin' in my writtens
But if you listen pay attention positivity's mentioned
My composition has a 50 slash 50 division
I can please both crowds no vocals is my intentions
When I do that wit rap I expand my comprehension
Extendin' my knowledge like goin' to college at Princeton
The industry's missin' and interpretation that's sickenin'
They was wishin' I presented so now I'm forever in it
The business...",My Interpretation,2004

You could make the newspaper, get ya own page
And make the news too, you know how my dudes do
We wear masks so you can't tell, who's who
And for the cash, we'll blast at you dudes too
Wit the lead pipe, so get ya head right
I'm in the Benz, rims, spin at the red light
I'm comin for cash, gun in the dash

Organs on the floor of the van
Cause you gotta show these fagot motherfuckas, that you more of a man
y'all want to fly like Mike, motherfuckas
So they won't find you, or your Jordan's again
Take a boss to be ordered the men, give them a call
If you don't have my money, in 24 hours
Then the cocksucka won't see his daughter again
It's like the movie that you seen, I'm the star of the screen

And take six to the face, I dug a hole for you today

Did time, been on the strip and grip nines

I got my gun right here, I ain't scared of you motherfuckas
I'm a hustler, plus a check cutter
I stretch butter, in ? X, now that's gutter
I came for war, you know what them thangs is for
Slug make ya blood stain the floor
It ain't a game no more, niggas gon' respect me
I grip gats, that kick back like Jet Li
So don't test me, or the boy S.P

Good evening Cassidy, Real Talk

Life is cruel but you can choose your life
An' if you 'on't make the right moves you could lose ya life
An' that ain't cool there's rules you gotta use in life
But I make the news tryna get some food to bite
Dudes drool when they see my jewels, cubes of ice
So I don't go nowhere without the tools at night, RIGHT
This for my niggas tryna choose they wife
An' my sistas that's tryna choose the dude they like
They call all men dogs cause ya'll prove 'em right
Until they get confused an' wanna choose a dyke
An' ya right hand man that you refuse to fight
Might stab you in the back but won't use a knife, RIGHT
Don't get it confused I moved the white
I get cream from the fiends that abuse the pipe
I like money, guns, ice, and alotta yea
So stress is the price I guess I gotta pay

Ha, ha that's real talk right there Cass
That's real talk baby. I mean the streets gon' relate to this one
They can relate to this

Yeah. Better play by the rules
Cause I'm tellin' you lotta niggas turn fools
Get lost in the system and get jammed with the nine
Tellin' you man respect my man Cass
It's fo' real on the field. This is Waah son talkin'
Fuck what ya heard

I always tried to do it big but had small paper
Now I'm goin' big my friends want small favors
I'll see ya'll later cause I'm tryna stack
An' ya'll just tryna keep my back against the wall paper
You think it's easy to rap, this shit hard labor
I put years in; blood, sewat, and tears in
Plug ya ears in cause this real talk an' this some true shit
We all go through shit
See baby girl she got a seed on the way
An' she 'on't know how she gon' feed her lil' seed everyday
Another young brouther gon' bleed everyday
We in the gutta that's why we smoke weed everyday
Daddy locked but he innocent
He can't afford a lawyer and his public defender a degenerate
An' mommy she just heard her daughter call
She ain't got no lights and they 'bout to cut her water off

Uh, you know we all gon' pay
A matter ah time, we gon' live though
Don't even worry bout it. Just a matter of time
We be straight. Do whatchu gotta do
Stay focused. Gotta put ya time in
You 'on't put no time in you ain't gon' get nothing out of this
So you put ya time in, now it's your time believe that

I'm tryna get out the gutta look I don't grind for nothing
This so my lil' brother won't be deprived for nothing
Dodgin' duckin' bustin' feastin'
In police handcuffs goin' up the precinct
You could get stuck up by the sluts you sleep witt
While you eattin' it, suckin' it, fuckin' it, creepin' it
Even our young bucks is stuck on some street shit
Cuttin' school, puffin', plus they freakin', cussin', speakin' outrageously
I'm tryna get from route A to Z, get a house, play the V
Get a spouse, make a seed, relax and live
The kid Cassidy tell it how it actually is
I been stackin' bread but 'fore you look I'm gone
An' I'mma crook every song they put me on
An' it ain't no questionin' that
Man I know I'mma blow I just pray for the rest of you cats

That's what I'm sayin' man uh huh
You know the industry is what it is

The boy's got at least six digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like ten bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers

I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em

I don't jump ship I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting I'm fine

Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough

If it's beef when we meet then I'm spaying shit up
Prraat prraat.I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends can envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggaz will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die, but I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, guac-a-moola
I pop the ruger, send that hot shit through ya!
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggaz out here are playing fair
So before the odds are even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga I'm that sick

It got my mind scrambled the and egg and an omelette
I talk to God every day, and he made me a promise
Me and T like, Malcolm and Alasia mahomie
Me and Swizz like Martin and Jessy
But the fact that I can get assassinated, is startin to stress me
I ain't tryna let the police department arrest me
But I still keep the steel tucked under the fresh tee
And I ain't just rapin for my health

Pretend to be BIG, pretend to be Pac, pretend to be hot

And goin' to jail, like goin' to hell

To get paid you got saved dont be spending the change, 
In 5th grade i was hustling my genesis games, 
I was dumb young, selling chewing gum to my classmates, 
On the cash chase, moving at a fast pace, 
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummys do, 
So I had to mill the bird before I turn twenty two, 
More money more problems is true, 
Cuz the more money I make the more problems for you,
Yeah I use dude voice, props to the boy sean, 
He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song, 
So stop drawn man you gotta respect it, 
I'm the best swizz got it perfected, 
Dont mess with C-A double S-I-D-Y, 
Cuz I became the best when B-I-G died, 
The kid do it big like P-U-N, 
Cuz I'm nice like P-A-C with the P-E-N

Now when I got to the spot I was ringing her phone 
Like I'm thinking bout bringing you home 
But that ain't what its all about unless that's what chu thinking about 
I ain't fresh I'm jus taking you out 
Listen 
Getcha nails done,
Getcha hair fixed do all of that and call me back on the cell sis 
I ain't the hell rich

Lock still reppin Tony blue gotcha

Cassidy,"It's a real bad time for black celebrities, they lockin everybody up

Michael Jackson, James Brown, Tupac, R. Kelly, OJ Simpson, Mike Tyson, 
Kobe Bryant, Jay-Z, Mystikal, P. Diddy, Allen Iverson, Snoop Dogg, DMX, 
Styles P, Shine, Beanie Segal, Lil' Kim. 

[Chorus]
Is it because I'm Black 
Is it because I'm Black 

When you black you got to hustle, got to struggle and strive. 
And not every cat that goes through that struggle survive. 
But he got to stay stronger and keep the struggle alive. 
They say the struggle died, I say the struggle revived. 
My profession is going through oppression. 
That's why I'm so stressed and I'm working with no rest, 
And no question ima fight for y'all cause I don't like it y'all, 
We make half as much as them, we workin twice as hard yall. 
It ain't fair sometimes you seein heaven signs, I ain't Pharaohcon 
But I got knowledge and I'm sharing mines. I swear its time to 
Be aware that they fear you mind, and they fear your heart. You 
Want to change here's the start. I'm tired of watching cops outline 
My peers and y'all, I'm trying to make a move, I'm not trying to make 
The news. They say the consequences worst when we break the 
Rules. To get back and right you got to make a sacrifice. 

[Chorus]

We got some problems we need solve, here's our chance to get them handle. 
Just take the boycott in Alabama for example. They stop ridin the bus till they 
Address their affairs. And they ended segregation in less then a year. So imagine 
What our status if we made a contribution, we'll probably be able to change the 
Constitution. I can't see no other kind of solution we deserve our reparation, its 
Time for a revolutions. I'm a step ahead of Satan, I read it in Revelation. Forget 
Your reputation, lets make it a better nation, cause they trying to cage us in, 
Make us slaves again, eventually its meant to be the new plantation, the penitentiary. 
For centuries they had a plan we let them executed, everyday another brother getting 
Executed. And all our artist getting arrested I aspect improvement. It's a message 
In the music, I suggest you use it. 

[Chorus]

On the streets its hard to survive.
Why, is it because I'm black,
Hot Shot got rock, I can't bring my cousin back.
Five-hundred thousand sold, gold, yeah it wasn't platinum,
But Clyde gave me another try, cause I wasn't whack.
And now I'm buzzin back, yeah I got my budget back.
Renegotiating got a mil to do a dozen tracks.
Yea I'm eatin only reason is because I rap,
my homies eatin only reason is because of crack.
They can't get a job so them niggas quick to rob, quick to steal,
Quick to kill, grip the steal, quick to ride.
Malcolm X, Martin Luther King we can't forget them guys.
These politician, hypocrites they got us hypnotize.
That why I kiss rick, why, we got to lift our eyes.
Cause if we keep 'em close they just goin keep control.
And hold our sisters and brothers in the pen and we was born guilty
Cause the color of our skin",The Message,2005

Cassidy, yeah
Uh, I'm out here on the grind

I'm out here on the grind tryna get a little change
When niggaz tryna shine just to get a little name
They act a little funny and they talk a little strange
But they need to get they money and enjoy a little fame
Cause I'm out here on the grind tryna get a little change
When niggaz tryna shine just to get a little name
They act a little funny and they talk a little strange
But they need to get they money and enjoy a little fame

I was told it's a crazy world, well I was born crazy too
1982, they said I was a baby who
Always started trouble, start to hustle what they made me do
As I grew as a man, my plans and my gravy grew
Coke, I copped a little, posted on the block a little
My block popped a little even though my rocks was little
But now a nigga grown started sellin bigger stones
Got a steady clientele that can't leave the shit alone
Keep it on the hivic homes, can't leave ya shit at home
If I spit it, I did it, I lived it, we can get it on
Forget it, I'm sick with it, the midget'll get shitted on
You don't wanna get the chrome, you wanna getcha phone
You don't wanna brawl at all, you wanna call the law
But if you get called a snitch, you might as well call it quits
And I might answer the phone when ya call ya bitch
I push bars like rod, this shit all will flip

Man I'm out here on the grind
I'm out here on the grind
I'm out here on the grind

I do this for the hood and I do this for the streets
I do this for my peeps cause my family gotta eat
I do this for the thugs that be hustling the drugs
I do this for my niggaz who be bustin all the slugs
I'd do this for the love but I do this to get paid
I do this for my niggaz in the cells and in the graves
I do this for my niggaz on the block that keep it thorough
I do this for all the hustlers around the world
Cause I'm out here on the grind

Don't abuse the fame, use ya brain fore you open ya mouth
Or you could get poked ouch with the toast in ya mouth
I doubt I'ma go broke, I be done broke in ya house
You don't hustle just cause niggaz cook coke in ya house
If I stop sellin coke, it'll drought
And my flow so dope, I got insurance on my throat and my mouth
I change the game, my name gets spoken about
I'm still ill with the smoke in my mouth (whoa)
Ya sis oped, and I'ma open her blouse
Stick my dick down her throat and start stroking her mouth (whoa)
I let my unborns float in her mouth
And then I put a condom on and start stroking her out (whoa)
I blow the hydro to the scout
On the post with the rock inside got most of the clout
And most of the cash I'm bragging and boasting about
Copped a yacht and got a dock, I can float to the house
Got damn, you wouldn't understand how I'm feeling man
I'm chilling man, all for the love of drug dealing man
I got change I'm gon borrow
That's why I got a quarter million dollar painting hanging on my wall
So naw, I ain't pressed for paper
But I'm dealing weight and got real estate tryna stretch the paper
It's best to invest the paper
But if you wanna battle, let's bet, I could use the extra paper
Cause I'd do whatever to eat
I'm from the street, if it's beef, it's whatever, I ain't never been sweet
And in a battle, I ain't never been beat
I'm in the race to take Jay-Z place, and you ain't better than Bleek
When I speak, you can tell that I'm wise
Dog, I got the best punch lines since Big L was alive
And this was a big L so I'm already high
If a nigga better than me, then he already died

And you probably wouldn't of sold loads if wasn't for kels
Well you was crazy man with the punch line flow
But now you the ladies man where the punch lines go
Yo it don't get no better
You was smiling chi-town stepping but ain't get no cheddar

That track would have been wack if it wasn't for jigga
I'm a ladies man chicks loving a nigga

You know how like em man, super official right
All day if it ain't official I ain't fucin wit her

So many nights I felt like crying (can't get you out my mind)
All this time I felt like dyin
(love's so hard to find)
So I (gotta move on)
Yes I (gotta stay strong)
And I (gotta keep it going)
So long (so long)

It's usually the beauty that attract me
But perhaps she was the right person,
Her personality made me happy and that's why I pursued her
I'm a dude that make manoeuvres
If I choose her then she whipped cause my dick as long as a ruler,
She maybe kind of crazy its cool long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Poobah and I can charm a computer,
For us to conversate all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing when I'm speaking she taking lessons,
But every time we argue and fight I feel like I'm dying,
I feel like trying tell you the truth,
You feel like I'm lyin but I'm a move on cause I'm strong as ever
Without you, I can do better but I can never forget about you girl.

[Chorus]

Ay yo I laced you with the girl braces when you was young,
Doing ya thang I went to amfye and buy you dem benaces,
Queen of the temple with the sent of a Lemon
All of that lenin shit at time I'm just observing your menin with all that long hair,
Sexy, mean walk and your von gear we at the pond you all up
Under my arm when we shopping embracing your re-lock and gloks and tims
Flyin from Africa yo back to the, you just a sadosure that's why your ones is owsed
Up cause when I needed you, you never got flossed up a laced out lady with taste
I gotta just kiss ya face keep ya nigga growned these are the brakes. One!

[Chorus]

Without her being close is depressing,
They say ain't nobody perfect but a honey rosted complexion
Close to perfection plus she got a body that could
Probably turn a gay man straight, to stay in shape mommy started taking karate,
So while she get it done in the gym runnin the treadmill I'm runnin for feds
Still, keep one in the bed still I be reminiscing boo,
Missin you that's dead real cause you nice in the bed
And you nice with the hand skills you awfully fine,
I can't get you off my mind, I ain't frontin yea I lost a dime
But you crossed the line and ain't follow directions you gone, gettin back together is out
Of the question, I moved on.

I'm in the zone all by myself,
I'm alone all by myself I'm on my own,
But homes I could set the tone myself,
And make the track that I could rap on myself
I wrote the rap myself, did the track myself, went in the booth produced that myself, I did the bass did the claps myself, did the drums snares and the high hats myself, uh I play each sound I'm banging out beats now, the only one with heat now holdin the streets down, I paint pictures everybody could see but besides god I ain't got nobody but me...

[Chorus x 2]
I'm in the zone all by myself
I'm alone all by myself,
But I don't need nobody else, but me... and god...

I wanna thank my fans, good lookin for the mail,
Cause I was goin through it when they put me in the jail, they put me in the cell, just me and the rats, and my relationship with god is what kept me relaxed, DA will say anything except for the facts, and they had alot of evidence except for the gats,
Before they prove you guilty they will treat you like a criminal, they tried to give me first degree they said it was intentional, I had to get shit together on my own, the media was talkin like I'm never comin home, me and my mother used to talk together on the phone, she said keep your faith and you will beat this case, yup

[Chorus x 2]

I gotta clique that'll grip steel for me,
I gotta squad that'll ride that'll kill for me,
But I argue and fight with my own mother, and now a days you can't even trust your own brother,
So make sure you keep your enemies the closest to you, cause your friends will the ones who put the toasters to you, that's why u gotta watch your surroundins, cause niggas that can swim love watchin you drownin, so only real niggas chill with me, but ain't nobody gonna pay my bills but me, see, you might got a crew that can help, but if you want it done right u gotta do it yourself

Damn I miss the damn I miss the damn I miss the game
Game, when it's gon' come back, come back
I'm gettin tired of the dumb rap, dumb rap
Man I done been there and done that, let's move on
Damn I miss the damn I miss the game
Game, when it's gon' come back, come back
I'm gettin tired of the dumb rap, dumb rap
Man I done been there and done that, let's move on

Damn I used to love this rap shit
When it was on some gold rope, Kangol hat shit
Now e'ry rapper on some bust-that-gat shit
Cut-that-crack shit, fuck that whack shit
Public Enemy was on some power to black shit
Rap cats need to get back on that shit (real tough)
They need to try switchin they flows
Cause all of our women ain't bitches and hoes
And e'ry rapper out got a brick on the stove
and his wrists all froze, and he whippin the Rolls
To hear that, I can listen to Hov'
You bullshit and then you gettin exposed (y'knah wah im talkin bout)

[Chorus]

Yo what happened to the game?
All these niggaz rappin the same and that's lame (that's lame)
Cats hustlin, bustin they gat
But Kurtis Blow wasn't talkin 'bout hustlin crack
Now e'rybody on the grind (uh-huh)
But Run-D.M.C. never killed nobody in their rhyme (nah nah)
They wasn't on that beef shit (uh-uh)
And Melle Mel was the first one to talk that street shit
But e'ry since N.W.A. came out
Cats turned gangster and took that same route (MAAAN~!)
To hear that I could listen to 'Pac
You bullshittin and I'm wishin it'd stop

[Chorus]

I don't even listen to rap now
It make my head hurt when I listen to cats now
They sound like they all rhymin in one route
So take the industry and put 'em all in one group
Since they on the same page (yeah)
We should be able to boo them dudes offa the same stage (boo)
F'real, I still love this rap shit
Even though the A runnin with that snap shit
Even though the Bay runnin with that hyphy
When I get on the mic niggaz still won't like me
To hear crack, you can listen to me
You bullshittin, you ain't sicker than me, uh-huh

Hey... look what he done for me
Look-look-look, look-look-look, look what he done for me

When I'm floatin off course then the Lord is my anchor

When I kill time with my son that's keepin it gangster
I'm done beefin cause I'm eatin
I feel bein a father to my son that's keepin it real (ill)
And I'm the one providin at home
So I can't leave my seed to survive on his own, NOOO!
No, it's not optional man
That's why I maneuver through the obstacles man
And, I watch for the snakes that's in the grass
So I can stay alive and be a daddy to Cas

Look at Big L, Soulja Slim and Big Pop'
Jam Master Jay, the boy Proof and the kid 'Pac
You and me gon' have to see to it the (ish) stop
If not, they gon' bring rap to a pitstop
Plus the hip-hop cops ain't a myth ock
They'll love to sit you in the box if you slip up
You a big shot, you will get more time
Look at C-Murder, Cool C and the boy Shyne
Beans and Kim got a day and a year
It's rules to the game and they ain't playin it fair, yeah

Hey! God is good, God is great
It's a reason that I'm breathin and it gotta be faith

I get my paper on my block
I get my paper from my block
I get my paper all the time I keep tellin' you

Look if you deal coke and your still broke
Start grindin' more homes
Cause I'm a drug connoisseur homes
In the hood good jobs so hard the find like dinosaur bones
I'm tryi'na start shinin' more homes
Thats why I make em hurry up and buy
Like that china store homes
Cause they'ya give ya time for a dime or more stones
And tell it ain't ma twist I'm not that kinda boy homes
But a lotta niggas singin' like the commodore homes
I'm ridin' when its time for war homes
The chrome on my hip could flip a fully grown dinosaur homes
I'm the kinda boy known to split domes when I palm the Taurus
Or spray rounds that could lay down a tyrannosaurus
Ma mind like a thesaurus
I'ma shine regardless my brain a dictionary
Lames I'm quick to bury
I spit scriptures and put pictures on obituaries
So get your own sound
The hustlas home now

[Chorus: x3]

E'ry bar I write like a brick of that hard white
I've truly been blessed
This a gift from the lord Christ
So if you livin' the hard life you cant give back the hand you was delt
So play ya cards right
They say you ain't promised tomorrow right?
So I stay in the streets like a deer that stare in that car light
With the high beams on and the fog lights lit
I get my lean on
On some bars type shit
Until my cream gone and my bar like this
In my all white tee and my all white kicks
And I still toss the white on the strip
Thats why I floss like this
With my frost bite wrist cause we all quite rich
I love this life
I threw different color ice in my cross like swiss
And all I give brauds is hard type dick
Have 'em twirlin' they tongue
Yeah I know I got a girl and a son
But um, its a mans world and I'm as real as they come

[Chorus: x3]

I'm from a block where niggas get it poppin' at
Where kats is known for boxin' and poppin' gats
But you gotta aim low when you poppin' that
Cause that hot shit got kicked like a soccer match
I'm from where the m1s and the choppas at
Philli is where you could come to go gun shoppin' at
You rockin' plack
Got the chain with the watch to match 
You better watch ya back it'll be gone you ain't got yo gat
Kats'll jack ya,POP, he ain't got a strap
Kats'll rob ya mom if she got a stack
Cause niggas tryin'a get paid
And niggas ain't tryin'a get waves when they rockin' a stockin' cap
Where I'm at, they got gourmet pots of crack
And you will spend like 24 for a block of that
My niggas tryin'a get the cheese but no not to rat
I'm from a block where snitchin' ain't a option at

[Chorus: x3]",I Get My Paper,2007

To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cheese and get out these crazy streets
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some gwop and get off this crazy block
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cake and get out this crazy place
To get away I got to pray that it'll
Be all good if I get out this crazy hood and I pray

I pray everyday for a better life 
But it's never a night I ain't trying to get my cheddar right 
Make it better Christ I'm on both of my knees 
I""m trying to stop coppin' cope by the keys 
I'm sorry father but I got to keep a toaster to squeeze 
I be stressin' cause the blessings I'm supposed to receive 
I ain't gettin' yo I'm supposed to succeed 
But I didn't yo I didn't know cause I was naive 
But now I'm gettin' dough 
My son gettin' plead I hit the stage and spit a flow 
I rip the show and make enough monet to but a brick of snow
I get to travel to places you never get to go 
So I got to move from the block I'm a lot richer yo 
I'm a lot sicker yo I make hits quicker yo 
When I blaze the haze and mix it with the liquor yo 
Niggas know to get cake I need these streets 
So I'ma stay but I pray that I could leave these streets everyday

[Chorus]

For a life full of transgressions is heaven harder than inner 
Are the roads to the pearly gates all for repenters 
Is the harder the winter the harder the sinner 
Lord I blow so much kush the answers hard to remember 
I'ma win the game hands down if yall the contenders
Cause yall far from the real thing see yall the pretenders
I know I ought to go to church and pay my tides 
But I'd rather play the hand I'm delt and wake my eyes 
And I drop to my knees and I pray my god 
That when you save my soul you save my squad 
Cause they some vicious killas that'll spare no life 
They don't pray to Allah and they don't fear no Christ 
So don't where no ice cause they'll run up and clap you dummy 
Which proves my theory the route to evils the lack of money 
So that's the reason why I stack my money 
I'm tryin' to move from these streets and concentrate on this rapper money

[Chorus]

Man we supposed to be family and we all hood 
If we all could get money it'll be all good 
Cause we all street but we all deep 
I'm tryin' to make more to make sure that we all eat until 
We all fall then we get fed then get bread we hustlin' 
To try to stop sufferin' 
Yea I put my L in the air I got love for them 
And everyday I pray that they stop strugglin'

You just a family man, tryin' settle down,
You on parole, so you scared to hold the metal now,
You moved away from the hood, I'm in the ghetto now,
Yea, I grip pipes, I jus like how the metal sound,

But you ain't tough as me,
I'll burn you like a dutch-a-tree!

You a snitch, you a rat, you a sing, you'll hold the note,
I sold the coke, or smoke weed till I'm comatose,
I live by the rules, I was schooled by the older folks,
I was showed the ropes by the cats that was holdin' toast,
Lords knows even goons get the holy ghost,
Yea, I believe in Christ but I'll still squeeze a pipe,
And I don't even need to write, or switch the flow,
You niggas know I ain't murda fluke or cysi-ro!
I'm way sicker yo, so who ever supposed to be nice
Get 2 choices, the toast or the knife!

[Verse 1]
Here's a story about a youngin' that started off strugglin'
He didn't like his life so he started off hustlin'
He was doin good in the hood with the cane
Whole hood knew his name, he had neighborhood fame
Now he stays dressed up
Just copped the fresh trucks
Stepped his rep up, plus he stepped his connect up
But guess what, he don't even mess with his old niggas
They hatin' cause he makin' more money those niggas
So one day when he was chillin on the block, dealin' rock
Tryin' to make a killin' on the block
Some dudes came, masks down, told him lay his ass down
Then they blasts rounds and started fillin' him with shots
He can't feel his legs, got grazed in his head yo
He might be paralyzed but he could've been dead though
He on his bed yo, prayin' to God
If he survives that he promise to stay on his side

[Chorus x2]

Here's a story about a shorty chasin' the cream
Her daddy was an inmate, her mommy was a fiend
Her grandmoms old so she couldn't get control of her
It was all love 'til the drugs took a hold of her
First it was liquor then it was weed
Then next came the wet then the syrup and V's, E's
Oxy Contin, she poppin' them pills
And if you got a couple dollars she'll hop in your wheel (For real)
Until one day a nigga with paper
Took her out, got her pilled up then he raped up
Fam even had a camcorder and taped her
As soon as her high faded, shorty felt violated
So she stopped gettin' high all the damn time
Only person she could talk to was her grandmom
Now every Sunday she be goin' to church with her
She leaned on the lord, now he startin' to work with her

[Chorus x2]

Here's a story about a young rapper named Cassidy
He started off at 13, I mean he actually
Signed his first deal when he was still goin' to high school
10th grade, way back then he was a fly dude
He played by the rules, determined to get cake
He started off battlin' and rippin' the mixtapes
But he didn't take the same path that the rest do
He dropped a debut that was highly successful
That's when the respect came, that's when the cheques came
He realized life is like playin' a chess game
Him and Swizz, they started makin' the next album
They say when you make more money expect problems
But the problem that he faced was unheard of
They locked him up, no bail and charged him with murder
But now he got his freedom restored
And he livin' his dream that's why he leanin' on the side of the lord

How could it be new? How could it be my cheatin' ways through?
How could it be it's me in pursuit about to get a white suit
About to get a night job just to keep my mind grounded in you
And all that jazz, what else can make a nigga spend all his cash?

A chick with a face, a chick with a little skinny waist
A chick with a mind that match her nice taste
Plus I got the mind to snatch you like weight

Why you wanna tie me up like Rick James?
Reverse the Porsche as long you got them little high heels on
It's on, it's on

This is somethin' I never wanted but since I met you I've been on it
I think about you all the time, can't get you off my mind
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

Thinkin' I'm going all the way, I wanna show you but I'm afraid
I know you say it's all on me, maybe tonight I'll let you see
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me but I like it, I like it

I heard you whisper somethin' to me
Hold me close now, baby don't leave
Emotions taking over, somethin's controllin' me
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

What am I feeling' it's gettin' stronger
And I can't hold it back for much longer
Although we try to be cool, it's all because of you
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me but I like it, I like it

Nah, in a minute I might have to check myself into the psych ward
I'm goin' crazy and I don't know what I'm fightin' for
See it's too easy to run from this
And my mind's sayin' I can't really fuck with this

Try to resist but every passionate kiss blow my mind like a terrorist
You can be mine on some forever shit
I'm intrigued, believe me
Try to be tough but the look in your face is so delectated

It's somethin' you doin', you got me in a trance
You got me ruing and doing shit I ain't used to doin'
Thinkin' 'bout a chance, maybe a slow dance
Maybe we hold hands, fur coats and France

Go diving on beaches with white diamonds in the sand
Then we hand gliding over Cannes
And then you can be my number one fan
And I could be your love in the club for as long as the song lasts

The way you make me feel got me goin' crazy
Tell me what you doin' tonight
I'll be there right away, take a ride with you, home late

Ohh, and you know I'm gonna give you my love
Boy I so glad that you're mine
Do you wanna spend some time with me?

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you doin' to me but I like it, I like it

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you doin' to me but I like it, I like it",Must Be Love,

We've been through this a thousand times
And I've never been more sure then I am right now
{Cassie ugh shhh}
Please don't say anything
Its just about that time

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
I think its finally time that I'm moving on

Ohh I can't stop the way {I love you}
I've got to let this go
Although we've {tried}
Doesn't really matter no more
And I don't know what I stay here for
Especially when I know I gotta make a move

I think its finally time that I'm moving on

don't tell me I should stay {Its too late now}
To think we can make this work somehow
You should know the truth {Its over}
Over and done 
Ohh and I can't believe
All of this time you've had me thinking
Thinking you would call me late night
Knowing damn well you wouldn't do it
Telling me I was still on your mind
I don't know why you had to put me through it
And I'm thinking I'm still livin for your love
It was all over and you knew it
Although its gonna be hard to let this go
Boy this is something I gotta do

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong

You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
I think its finally time that I'm moving on

Gave you all of my heart
All of my body
All of my soul
All of my precious time
And you know its so hard loving somebody
And I loved you so good baby you can't deny
You know this time that respect just goes away
Let it fade away
And the only way to heal is to give me time and space
And I guess its time

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try

He told me I'm the only one that he could see 
And I said ""ditto, ditto, ditto."" 

It's been a while my baby 
I told you we could love in spite of all the things that they see 
I said I wouldn't want no one if all you wanted was me 
I knew back then you were the only one you're all that I need 
Oh, knew that you were all that I need 
Baby, now I gotta be 
Part of you you're part of me

All this time you've been waiting

But if you want that
It's a wrap

I know you, were prepared
And you know what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares
The same love on the balcony

I saw a tourist staring back at me
In times square in new york city

Last night, good kush and sirrock with a super freak
Told him put it on my black card,
Get it super sweet
We can do it right now girl, I don't give a fuck
Right here in the valley, we can do it in the truck
Got her legs on the dashboard, yeah I got a boulder
Don't know if the kush heat with the
Go, but I'll be back though

Had a couple drinks, later air it was perfect
The enjoying the scene, now breathe
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew, through my hair love
I stunned by your stare
From the sight of you, standing there love
I could walk, walk on air
Then we made love on balcony
Right there in new york city
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In times square in new york city
And in that moment the city was mine

I told her look, baby talk to me, you know I'ma talk
You know that tic talk... yeah you gonna get the
Look I got you soaking wet
Yeah you my needle white, swish
Turn it right,
Tear you like I'm kevin hard, you gonn learn tonight
I ain't no funny nigga nah I ain't got jokes
Wake up in the morning tell your girls that you got choked
Bust it wide open, turn it up, blew it back
Turn that presidential suite, swerving deep, like a crack house
We're at the rich and I got her on the balcony
One stop shop ain't nobody coming after me

What you doin' tonight?
Oh shit

Shawty so cold, pussy winter fresh
Reservations to eat and you my dinner guest
Shawty clean up nice, never been a mess
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain't try to hurt her, ‘cause I've always been the best
At making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I'm a fan of her talent, so I've always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn't reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn't reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands

Call me crazy, shit at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don't it, boy?
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you're mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right

The club popping but she ain't trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I'm the only one that get up in that VIP
My money grown, baby, ain't no need to see id
Slide her somethin' just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you're getting to the most money
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear
But you're overdressed if you're wearing underwear
Now turn up, couple J's to burn up
Couple spots to hide out, now let that playlist ride out
Where I live on Sunday, your place Monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol yo, kissin' on the balls like the dick a mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo
Bad bitch good girl around the Christmas, though (Nice)

Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushin' I drink the best juice
I'm drinking till nothing left too
And she playing with herself, too
I been thinking about her all day
She perform like it's Broadway
Yeah, we hop in the range, she off top with the brain
Got the windows down, broad day
Just look at her, spectacular
Throw her on the stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her, but you see them niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause I don't ever get back to her
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her
She's a trigger, I never seen her with a bad bitch
Unless she's meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real all these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples, super fine at you
If she's giving head, She's throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don't mind that you do
Might just wanna watch, I ain't taking time at you, dudes
Never faking, why they hella front?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that's all she ever wants
Somethin' bout the alchemy, she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony, we 'bout to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you the shit
Couple days with her, man, that's all I ever get
Yeah she got a little sister, that's all she ever with
Game like a nigga, man, that's wall she ever spit
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back, she don' left couple there
spent a couple stacks, I don' put a couple pair
Try to bag mine, my nigga I double dare
Never retract statements, nigga, I'm never scared
Niggas be switching up, but nigga, I'm never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here
Listen up, bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you're doing what you're supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl, though, I just need you in my world, yo

Cassie Franklin,"Lady Margret was standing in her own room door
A comb in her long, yellow hair
When, who did she spy but sweet William and his bride
As to the churchyard they drew near

Then day passed away and night coming on
Most of the men were asleep
Lady Margret appeared all dressed in white
Standing at his bed feet

She said, ""And how do you like your own bed?
And how do you like your sheet?
And how do you like your fair, young bride
That's lying in your arms asleep?""

He said, ""And very well do I like my own bed
Much better do I like my sheet
But most of all that fair, young girl
That's standing at my bed feet""

Then, once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold, corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

Well, then night passed away, the day came on
And into the morning light
Sweet William said, ""I'm troubled in my head
By the dreams that I dreamed last night""

""Such dreams, such dreams as these
I know they mean no good
For I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine
And my bride's bed full of blood""

He asked, ""Is Lady Margret in her room?
Or is she out in the hall?""
But Lady Margret lay in a cold, black coffin
With her face turned to the wall

""Throw back, throw back those snow white robes
Be they ever so fine
And let me kiss those cold, corpsy lips
For I know they'll never kiss mine""

Then, once he kissed her lily white hand
And twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold, corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

Cassie Silva,"Temprano el durazno, 
Del árbol cayó 
Su piel era rosa, 
Dorado del sol 
Y al verse en la suerte, 
De todo frutal 
A orillas de un río, 
Su fe lo hizo llegar 

Dicen que en este valle, 
Los duraznos son de los duendes 

Pasó cierto tiempo, 
En el mismo lugar, 
Hasta que un buen día, 
Se puso a escuchar, 
Una melodía muy triste del Sur 
Que así le lloraba, 
Desde su interior 

Quien canta es tu carozo, 
Pues tu cuerpo al fin, 
Tiene un alma 

Y si tu ser estalla, 
Será un corazón, 
El que sangre 

Y la canción que escuchas, 
Tu cuerpo abrirá, 
Con el alba

La brisa de Enero, 
A la orilla llegó, 
La noche del tiempo, 
Sus horas cumplió 
Y al llegar el alba,

At least I'd have a cherish all the memories

And I'm feeling desperate

With scars across my heart and on my wrists
When I looked in your eyes
I didn't know happiness had a price

And you take advantage of a simple heartbreak
At least you had to love to know how to ache
But don't, hesitate to let your feelings be known
It's better to love and lose then just be alone

And if they left you, and if they leave you
At least you know in their heart they will always keep you

Cassini Quartet,"One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.
You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.
You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.
Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.",The Old Music Master [BBC Broadcast],2006

No more space on my drive
I'm back in neverland woman
Innocense on my flag
Reminisence only give life to happy ends
Everyday I can be

Should we make it out
I wanna be your lover

It's to never see you sad
I'll steal your tears and ride the lightning
And the four winds to make them dry

First and lost we'll always be babe
Whatever we do
Together forever
Just like lovers do

Should we make it tighter
Be a slave to your rhythm
Should we make it out

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

I hear those things are awfully loud
It glides as softly as a cloud
Is there a chance the track could bend?
Not on your life, my Hindu friend

What about us brain-dead slobs?
You'll be given cushy jobs
Were you sent here by the Devil?
No, good sir, I'm on the level

The ring came off my pudding can
Take my pen knife, my good man
I swear it's Springfield's only choice
Throw up your hands and raise your voice

Cast,"You work all day for some old man
Sweat and break your back, uh huh
Then you go back to your castle
But your queen won't cut you slack, that's true

That's why you're losing all your hair
That's why you're overweight, uh huh
That's why you flipped your pick-up truck
Right off the inner state, that's right

Except for the pick-up truck, now you talk so tough
and act so rough but darlin', you can't hide the heartache
And the sadness that's buried deep inside
There's a lot of bull they hand you

There's nothin' you can do

I said no one understands but I do

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer

And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy

With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

But all work no God has left Jack with a lost soul
But he's moving on full steam
He's chasing the American dream
He's gonna give his family the finer things

Not this time son I've no time to waste
But maybe tomorrow we'll have time to play
And then he slips into his new little BMW
And drives farther and farther, farther away

'Cause he works all day and tries to sleep at night
He tells him thing will get better
Oh better in time

So he works and he builds with his own two hands
And he pours all he has in a castle made with sand
But the wind and the rain are comin' crashing in
Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
But will his kingdom stand?

His American Dream is beginning to seem
More and more like a nightmare
With every passing day
Daddy, can you come to my game?
Oh Baby, please don't work late
Another wasted weekend
And they are slipping away

'Cause he works all day and lies awake at night
He tells them things will get better
Just take a little more time

So he works and he builds with his own two hands
And he pours all he had in a castle made with sand
But the wind and the rain are coming crashing in
Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
But will his kingdom stand?

He used to say, whoever dies with the most toys wins
But if he loses his soul, what has he gained in the end
I'll take a shack on the rock
Over a castle in the sand
Now he works all day and cries alone at night
It's not getting any better
Looks like he's running out of time

'Cause he worked and he built with his own two hands
And he poured all he had in a castle made with sand
But the wind and the rain are coming crashing in

Their losing the fight for another day
The life that she's known is falling apart
A fatherless home, a child's broken heart
You're holding her hand
You're straining for words
You're trying to make sense of it all
She's desperate for hope
Darkness clouding her view
She's looking to you

Just love her like Jesus
Carry her to him
His yoke is easy
His burden is light
You don't need the answers
To all of life's questions
Just know that He loves her
Stay by her side
And love her like Jesus
Love her like Jesus

The gifts lie in wait in a room painted blue
A little blessing from heaven will be there soon
Hope fades into night,
Blue skies turn into gray
As the little one slips away
You're holding her hand
You're straining for words
You're trying to make sense of it all
They're desperate for hope

Stay by her side
And love her like Jesus

The God of all the nations holds our lives in His hands
The rock of our salvation holds our lives in His hands
He cares for them just as He cares for you.

Just know that He loves them

And wiped our tears away,
Stepped in and saved the day.
But once again, I say amen
That it's still raining

I'm with you
And as your mercy falls
I raise my hands and praise

And I'll praise you in this storm
And I will lift my hands

No matter where I am
And every tear I've cried
You hold in your hand
You never left my side

You heard my cry you raised me up again

Is there anyone that falls?
Am I the only one in church today, feeling so small?
Cause when I take a look around
Everybody seems so strong
I know they'll soon discover
That I don't belong
So I tuck it all away
Like everything's OK
If I make em all believe it
Maybe I'll believe it too
So with a painted grin
I'll play the part again
So everyone will see me
The way that I see them

Are we happy plastic people
Under shiny plastic steeples
With walls around our weakness
And smiles that hide our pain
But the invitations open
To every heart that's been broken
Maybe then we close the curtain
On our stained glass masquerade

Is there anyone who's been there?
Are there any hands raised?
Am I the only one who's traded
In the altar for a stage?
The performance is convincing
And we know every line in my heart
Only when no one is watching can we really fall apart
But would it set me free
If I dared to let you see
The truth behind the person
You imagine me to be
Or would your eyes be opened
Or would you walk away
Would the love of Jesus
Be enough to make you stay?

Above your deep and dreamless sleep
A giant star lights up the sky
And while you're lying in the dark
There shines an everlasting light

And is sleeping in a manger tonight

Oh Bethlehem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
For God became a man
And stepped into your world today

For the Bridegroom has returned
And has carried His bride away in the night

Finds me crying in the rain
All alone with my demons I am
Who is this man that comes my way?

They scream his name
Is this the one they say will set the captives free?
Jesus, rescue me

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free 

And as the god man passes by
He looks straight through my eyes
And darkness cannot hide
