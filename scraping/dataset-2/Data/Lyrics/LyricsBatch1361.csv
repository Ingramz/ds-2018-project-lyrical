Buddy Cole Trio,"I never traveled further North 
Than old Van Courtland Park
And never further South than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, 
But first let me remark
I saw it from the empire state solarium

But we've been putting nickels 
In the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, 
We can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin de-luxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant,
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block.

You're just the companion
I want at Grand Canyon
for throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block.

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To London in May time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block.

In Winter at Christmas,
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass,
We'll take a ride around the block.

We'll keep to our promise,
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling,
Still I am willing,
Just now to walk around the block.

Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok
Perhaps Vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables,
Accumulate labels,
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock,
But since we are flat in old Manhattan
Let's take a walk around the block.",Let's Take a Walk Around the Block,2010
Buddy Cole Trio,"I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Buddy Cole Trio,"There are many many crazy things
That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No they can't take that away from me",They Can't Take That Away From Me,2010

Buddy Cole's Four of a Kind,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

Buddy Cole's Four of a Kind,"""This is a song I've been singing for a long time. 
It's like an old friend. 
But, you know, I think it, 
it's only recently that I discovered what it's really about.""

You've got to give a little, take a little,
and let your poor heart break a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,
until the clouds roll by a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

As long as there's the two of us,
we've got the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us,
we've got each other's arms.

You've got to win a little, lose a little,
yes, and always have the blues a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

Coming from a troubled sky,
Winging through the clinging vine
Right into this heart of mine.

Listen to the night wind sigh,
How can I expect to sleep
When I lay me down to weep?

Your love has cooled

Buddy Cole's Four of a Kind,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1999
Buddy Colepiano,"Far away places with strange-sounding names
Far away over the sea
Those far away places with the strange-sounding names
Are callin', callin' me

Goin' to China or maybe Siam
I want to see for myself
Those far away places I've been readin' about
In a book that I took from the shelf

I start getting restless whenever I hear
The whistle of a train
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain

They call me a dreamer, well, maybe I am
But I know that I'm burnin' to see
Those far away places with the strange-sounding names
Callin', callin' me",Far Away Places,2013
Buddy Collette,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Buddy Collette,"They say, Ruby you're like a  dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

Alone where we have walked together

Buddy Collette,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high

Buddy Collette,"It was Montmartre 
It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Buddy Collette,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Buddy DeFranco,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Though by tomorrow you're gone

The way you sip your tea

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you",Moonglow,1958
Buddy DeFranco,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby,

Buddy DeFranco,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,1958
Buddy DeFranco,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Buddy DeFranco,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1961
Buddy DeFranco,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1975
Buddy DeFranco,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1990

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

And you'll be met there by others like you

Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer

Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

Why can't I let you know,

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

But Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
Fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
South to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down

Fought single-handed through the Injun War
Till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

He give his word an' he give his hand
That his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand
That justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his promise dear

Home fer the winter with his family
Happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
Bein' the father he wanted to be
Close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came
An' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame
An' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again

Off through the woods we're ridin' along
Makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a be 'are an' twict as strong
An' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear

Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
Where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
Where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
An' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
In his heart he wanted to leave it all
An' lose himself in the forests tall
But he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind
They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
Sent up to Nashville the best they could find
A fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier

The votes were counted an' he won hands down
So they sent him off to Washin'ton town
With his best dress suit still his buckskins brown
A livin' legend of growin' renown
Davy, Davy Crockett, the Canebrake Congressman

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
Fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
Took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
An' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear

Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
An' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand
An' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
Of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
An' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear

When he come home his politickin' done
The western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
An' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer

He heard of Houston an' Austin so
To the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
An' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear

His land is biggest an' his land is best
From grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test
Followin' his legend into the West

That's why that's why the lady
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp
Tramp
Hm, ooh

She gets too hungry for, dinner at eight, now
Hates the theatre but, never comes late
She never bothers, with the people she hates
That's why, that's why the lady is tramp

Don't go to crap games, with the barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls
She won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp
She loves the free, fresh, wind, in her hair
Life without care
She's broke, and that's ok
Hates California, it's so smuggy and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp, now

She gets massages, she cries and she moans
Tells Slenderella just to leave her alone
She's not so hot, but her shape is her own
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp
The food at Sardees is great no doubt
But she doesn't know what, motels all about
She puts in a dime, and some ice comes out
That's why the lady is a tramp

She loves the free fresh wind in her face
Diamonds and lace
No God, so what
For Rod Steiger she whistles and stamps
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
She don't know the reason for, cocktails at five
She don't like flyin' baby, but I'm glad I'm alive
I crave affection baby but not when I drive
That's why the lady is a tramp, now

She flew down to London and left me behind
I missed the crowning but, I didn't mind
She won't play Scarlet and Gone with the Wind
(It's got to rhyme)
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
I like to hang her hat, wherever I please
And fly, with a breeze
And no dough, hi ho
She thinks that Marciano was still a great big champ
That's why the lady is a tramp, now

She goes down to Coney and she thinks the beach is divine
She goes to the ball games and thinks the Yankees are fine
Why she reads Walter Winchell and understands every line
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
She likes do to go rowing down Central Park Lake
She digs a price fight, that isn't fake
Why she even goes to the opera, and stays wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
I like the green grass, under my shoes
Now what can I lose
She's flat, and that's that
She's all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp,

Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere 
Two of us together building castles in the air 
We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time the lovely long ago 
we didn't have a dime

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Buddy Greco,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits

Seeing you in summer I never would go.

That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

The sweet of you, the pure of you 
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you

When first I learned the truth,
Don't blame it on my heart,

You're free as the roaring tide
So there's no need to hide

Born free, and life is worth living
But only worth living

Buddy Greco,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new beneath
The blue umbrella sky

Then softer than a piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you, I lost you
To the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days
They go on and on

And guess who's sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickled friend, the summer wind

The summer wind
Warm summer wind
The summer wind

",Summer Wind,2004
Buddy Greco,"When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand

Buddy Greco,"Day in, day out
The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips
And the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar
A thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out",Day in Day Out,2004
Buddy Greco,"While the city sleeps, ev'ry night he creeps
Just surveyin' his domain
He roams around like he owns the town
He's the King, he makes that plain

He knows ev'ry trick, doesn't miss a lick
When it comes to keepin' track
Some city slicker, no one is quicker than
That darn cat

Ev'ry nook and cranny and garbage canny
He inspects so thoroughly
When he's on his rounds, nothin's out of bounds
To his curiosity

He can smile and purr at a pretty her
Till she don't know where she's at
Nose like a diner, oh, what a tiger is
That darn cat

He's a sly old codger, an artful dodger
A scrounger unsurpassed
A ball of fire, a nine live wire
Who just can't be outclassed

Yeah, this midnight rover, he lives in clover
It's an art he's got down pat
Never was a greater smooth operator than
That um darn, that darn cat

Um um

Now our cat's been paid ev'ry accolade
And he's earned all his acclaim
In a blaze of glory, he ends our story

From the fam'ly he begat

Buddy Greco,"Around the world I've searched for you;
I traveled on when hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous.
I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow,
You'd look at me and I would see
The smile you're smil-ing now.

It might have been in County Down,
Or in New York, or gay Paree,
Or even London town.

For I have found my world in you.",Around the World [From the Pan Am Soundtrack],2012

With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the hills, the tunnels
Never falter, never quail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us
Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In thy praise for evermore

You will roll up grades of trial
You will cross the bridge of strife
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life
Always mindful of obstruction
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

You will often find obstruction
Look for storms of wind and rain
On a hill, or curve, or trestle
They will almost ditch your train
Put your trust alone in Jesus
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train will guide
There you'll meet the superintendent
God the father, God the son

And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

Lying here, underneath the stars right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are and
How do you do?
How do you do, baby?
The clouds roll in across the moon
And the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

We never going to make that bridge tonight baby
Across lake Ponchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain

So batten down the hatch baby
And leave your heart up your sleeve
It looks like we're in for stormy weather,
That ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lay here, in my arms
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain",Feels Like Rain,1999
Buddy Guy,"I need someone's hands 
To lead me through the night 
I need someone's arms 
Just to squeeze and hold me tight 
And when the night began 
And the days have end 
I need your love so bad 

I need someone's lips 
To feel next to mine 
I need someone to stand up and tell me 
When I'm lying 
And when the lights are low 
And it's time to go 
I need your love so bad 

So, give it up 
And bring it home to me 
Write it on a piece of paper 
So it can be read to me 
Tell me you love me 
And stop driving me mad 
'Cause I need your love so bad 

I need a soft voice 
To talk to me at night 
Don't worry baby 
Don't fuzz and fight 
So listen to my plea 
Bring it home to me 
'Cause I need your love so bad 
Ohohoh I need your love so bad

Should ladies you don't hurt 'im. I said don't you hurt him! Man happens to be
God's gift to women! So ladies you must know that the man is already grown so you can't
Raise him over again

So the thing to do is throw your arms around him! Hold him close to
You! Look him straight in the eyes! And then you tell him you tell him, you
Say ""now baby you been messing up, but I know you gonna do me better."" and when he
Look at you as if he wanna know when, then you tell him ""someday baby."" and if it seem
Like he's hard of hearing or not paying you much attention or something do like you ladies
Are known to do put your hands on your hips and then you say it again ow! He have to
Be a mighty hard hearted person not to listen to you

But I don't think it's fair to just talk to the ladies, I think I should say a few words to the
Men too. So fellas I said fellas! Fellas if you got a woman and the lady don't do like
You think she should
Don't you be goin' upside of her head now. You know what I'm talkin' about, don't you be
Beatin' on her. The judgment's much cheaper if you don't beat her. And you see if you hurt
Her you only do one thing I said if you hurt her you only do one thing! You make her a little
Smarter and she won't let you catch her the next time. So the thing to do is throw your
Arms around the pretty little thing! Now listen to me, listen to me I don't care if she
Weigh thirty-two and a half pounds wet or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet. If she's
Your lady and you dig her, than she's your pretty little thing and then you tell
Her! You say ""baby! Baby I don't care what they say about you on the next block, your
My little lady and I dig you. Let em talk, let 'em say what they want to say""

And fellas, you must know too that the ladies, god bless their sweet little souls, ladies
Happen to be god's gift to man too fellas. You all agreed? You better say it cause your wife
Is listening. But there's just one more thing I must say to you fellas, just one more thing
Don't be too proud to beg. I said don't be too proud to beg! If you have to fall
Down on your knees to let your woman know that you love her, go on down there
I can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this evening what I'm tryin'
To say, ladies love to hear their men say ""baby I love you!"" don't
You ladies? I said ladies love to hear their men say ""baby I love you!""
Don't you ladies? So fellas tell your lady that you love her! She might
Think you're lying though. Tell your lady that you love her even if you are
Lying

But seriously speaking, when I goof, when I goof I usually slide up to my woman and I look
Straight at her I have to get my look first I usually say I look like a little puppy begging
For that last bone you been holding out on. I look straight at her and I say ""baby! Please
Forgive me honey!"" and then I wait a few minutes to see how she take it. And then I
Say ""baby! Please forgive me honey!"" and then I stand back far enough so that when
She swings I can duck and then I say ""baby! You know when I goofed last week I
Was high ""if she let me get away with that then I look at her real pitiful like this say
""Baby, honey you know when you're high it don't count. "" And then I tell her, I say
""If you forgive me honey I'm gonna do better."" And if she look at me as if she wanna know
When then I tell her ""someday baby ""

He grabbed me by the collar and began to shout
You better eat up all your beans, boy and clear right on out!?

Then my heart was all a mess

One hour to learn of all your charms
Then my heart's like a fire alarm

Twelve hours of you to tantalize
One day for me to realize
My heart flutters like butterflies

Seven days - a wedding to plan
One week and then I begin
My life of a happy married man

One month of fighting the missus

Someday, you'll know why I'm so blue

Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost
Don't turn away from me now

I weep over you when you cry
It is a thorn in my side
But if I lead will you follow
Me to the end of the times

Think it over in your pretty little head
Are you sure that I'm not the one
Is your love real or only fun
You think it over, yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old

Think it over and let me know
Think it over but don't be slow
Just remember all birds and bees
Go by twos through life's mysteries
You think it over, yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old

Think it over and think of me
Think it over and you will see
A happy day when you and I
Think as one and kiss the blues goodbye
You think it over, yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old

Think it over, think it over",Think It Over,1987

Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me

Heartbeat
Why do you skip when my babies lips meet mine
Heartbeat
Why do you flip and give me a skip each sign
Piddly pat
And sing to me love's story
And bring to me love's glory
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me",Heartbeat [Single Version],2005

With no particular place to go

Riding along in my automobile
I was anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go

No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the Kokomo
The night was young and the moon was gold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you image the way I felt
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still trying to get her belt a-loose
All the way home I held a grudge
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge

With no particular place to go",No Particular Place to Go,2006
Buddy Holly,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I Straddled that Greyhound,
and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rollin' out of Georgia state

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross Alabam
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh when The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate

Swing low chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten O nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line",Promised Land,2006
Buddy Holly,"Rock And Roll Music
Just let me hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it,
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick againt modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast,
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why I go for that

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music 

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo,
It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that

And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed, she screamed and yelled ""Hooray!""

Five thousand tongues were screaming ""More! More!""

And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell

The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well

Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell

When you told me that you loved me
I gave my heart to you

And your love the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
And my love came tumbling down

And may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish
Because I love you so
I'll still get lost, in a Fool's Paradise
