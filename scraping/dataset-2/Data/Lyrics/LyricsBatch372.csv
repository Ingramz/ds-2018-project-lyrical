Hunters & Collectors,"When success is on your mind
But true direction is missing
You know the Gods have lied - but you're still smitten.
By the stars in your eyes
I can tell you know where you are
Smile sweetly and you'll be forgiven.
You're almost free - almost free to come and go
Bed sitting room for ambitious prisoner.
Walk away, don't take no for an answer
Turn a blind eye to it all
Let sleeping dogs lie
Down in Queensway.

Like a bulldozer chasing butterflies
Down sad English streets you wander
Over sleeping bodies you step lightly.
All the snow on the ground
Lets you pass by without a sound
One last look before you disappear.
Walk away, don't take no for an answer
Turn a blind eye to it all
Let sleeping dogs lie
Down in Queensway.",Blind Eye,1995
Hunters & Collectors,"Know it sounds funny
But, I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl
You know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed! (yeah)

Ooh that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning!

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be
What they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it! no!

Ooh that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning!

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know
The things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me! Whoa, oh! Babe!

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy

Hunters & Collectors,"If I don't come home before midnight
And I call out your name in the dark
You'll know that I've been tempted
And I'll know that I've got no heart
And I'll know I won't be expected
And you'll think we're drifting apart
And I might as well be blowing at the top of the world
When my fingers find your body in the dark
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
So if I don't come home before midnight
And I can't find the keyhole in the dark
Burn the place down
Make it glow like christmas
The tenderness that's burning in my heart
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire...
If you can't open your eyes in the morning

If some maniac has been and left his mark
I'll be round to sift through the cinders
Lift the lid and take the thing apart
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire...
So to all you feelers and fumblers
Waiting for the fireworks to start
Do it now--blow it up yourself
Unbutton the butcher in your heart
And if I don't come home before midnight
And I can't find the keyhole in the dark
You'll know, you'll know that I've been tempted
You'll know, you'll know we're drifting apart

Hunters & Collectors,"Woke up this morning, 
from the strangest dream 
I was in the biggest army, 
The world has ever seen 
We were marching as one, 
on the road to the holy grail 

Started out, 
Seeking fortune and glory 
It's a short song, but it's a 
Hell of a story, when you 
Spend your lifetime trying to get 
Your hands on the Holy Grail 

Bud have you heard of the Great Crusade? 
We ran into millions, and nobody got paid 
Yeah, we razed four corners of the globe, 
For the Holy Grail. 

All the locals scattered, 
They were hiding in the snow 
We were so far from home, 
So how were we to know, 
There'd be nothing left to plunder 
When we stumbled on the Holy Grail? 

We were foolish beings 
But we were dying like flies 
And those big black birds, 
they were circling in the sky, 
And you know what they say, yeah, 
Nobody deserves to die. 

Oh I, 
I've been searching for an easy way 
to escape the cold light of day 
I've been high, and I've been low 
But I've got nowhere else to go 
There's nowhere else to go 

I followed orders 
God knows where I'd be 
But I woke up alone, 
all my wounds were clean 
I'm still here 
I'm still a fool for the Holy Grail 
Oh yeah, 
I'm a fool for the Holy Grail",Holy Grail,1995
Hunters & Collectors,"Well just the other night I come home
After three months of constant grind and travel
And I went sniveling
I went crawling around to my girlfriend's house

And she came down hard upon me
And she ground her finger into my breastbone
And she said
She said: ""You don't make me feel... like I'm a woman... anymore

And you don't make me feel like I'm a woman any more
You don't make me feel like I'm a woman any more
And I know
I know it's been a long time

Seems like it's been go-ing on forever
And my heart
My heart is beating
Too big

It's beating too big for the space that's meant to hold it
So good-night
Goodnight my little lovely
As we turn

As we turn down the lights
Say good-bye
Goodbye to the naked truth
Your skin is looking weary

And your eyes are closing down on the day
I know, I know it's been a long time
Seems like it's been going on forever
But just as black is white

Yeah and just as night is day
The light is going to leave you
And you're gonna fade away
So goodnight, goodbye my lovely

As we turn, as we turn down the lights
Say goodnight, goodnight to the naked truth
Your skin is looking weary
And your eyes are closing down on the day",Say Goodbye,1995
Hunters & Collectors,"I've been hearing round the town
You've been out and getting round

Hunters & Collectors,"Come on confess with confusion... spread it around
They trickle down your cheek...tears fall like seed on barren ground
Your thoughts are scattered like paper everywhere
Tiny piece of laughter and despair

But you cry true tears of joy

Passion is your weakness but you feed it everyday
Like a moth to the naked flame... you just can't keep away
You twist the truth and you turn the other cheek
But everybody knows it's just salvation that you seek

And you cry true tears of joy
Yeh you cry true tears of joy... oh yeah, alright

It flickers on your face
I can see it in your eyes
I knew for you a moment

Took a lie, took a lie, took a lifetime
Driven under 20k of rain
I had to crawl, I had to beg,
I had to pay for it through the nose
To get into this tiny shiftless room
With the barheater broken
And the stale chips in the oven
And the fly there on the table
With its legs stuck in the butterblock

Made the whole city shudder

Huoratron,"You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefields on on wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As  I plunge on into certain death

The hours he sweat with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round

We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights 
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my house below

Nd as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.",$$ Troopers,
Hurby's Machine,"Aurally potent, lethal, bust steady
Man your battle stations, I'm ready
Cold gettin' bigger, an idol-like figure
Play me if you want and make like a trigger
Squeeze off your best, you can huff and puff
But it's kiddie stuff because your best ain't good enough
Stand on attention, your body in line
This ain't your average rhyme, if it is, it ain't mine
Ducks, has-beens, I'ma show them all
I'm not a joker but I laugh cause y'all can't brawl
I roll the mic, smoked I lay it to rest
Embalmed in my palm, I touch it and it's blessed
Got style, I know the routine
All punks poppin' junk can't join my team
I got an attitude

I run through the motions, I don't ramble
Twenty to one I'm up to par, don't gamble
I take it till you're broke, you think it's a joke?
The last duck that laughed choked from my smoke
I light the mic on fire, set alarms to perk
Antoinette is alert, I put bodies to work
My attitude fills the room, you can feel the tension
And if I ain't around, just mention
I'm on the way with the mic at my side
Watch the ducks hit the road up to Duckhill Drive
When I finally approach I be in the mood
To get loose and get mine, me and my attitude
I got an attitude

Come to the party with an attitude, a mood to chill
When the music starts kickin' I can't keep still
Biters watchin' me, eyein' me, waitin' to make
Little rumors causin' tumors that I might break
But I'll never break, I'll just address the crowd
There's no ifs, no ands when it's pumped up loud
Cause I'ma rush em, crush 'em, shame, tame and blush 'em
Voices that are moist, I'll hush 'em
I'm no joke, the mic smoker of chicks
From the pack I'm the pick, no, it ain't no trick
I got rhymes that'll rock ya, beat that'll knock ya
If it don't shock ya the body'll stop ya
But don't play me close, other words hands off
Deep voice, hard and moist, playin' hard when you're soft
You want a cutie? Don't mean to harness the charm
Dom Perrignon in the arm, duck alert the alarm
I'm not braggin' or boastin', don't want to be rude
But ( ? ) keep tellin' I got an attitude

You want to know why I play you like that? I don't like your face
Take your running shoes off, you ain't in this race
Kick back, sit back, step off, sit down and be numb
Feed crumbs to bums, rock rhymes over drums
It ain't complicated, must I break it down?
Def rhymes from a lady with a real live sound
Must admit it I'm with it so get with it, you dig?
Flossin' carat and gear, and real hair, not a wig
Bodily I'm vivacious and vocally gracious
Antoinette's put together in all the right places
Fit to carry wit, makin' hit after hit
Never ask me to quit cause I'm eternally lit
You ain't ready, baby, sorry Sally, this is my thing
A lot of male vocalists can't even hang
And if they sound like a sissy when they diss they just piss me
Off, I get wild and on the mic I get busy
Bold just like a bee, I'm the queen of this thing
Rock a beat inside out like Whitney can sing
Clear my throat, hit a note, ( ? ) and bruised
You run circles with my words, I finds and loose
Ya, run your ( ? ) to the edge, you must be on Quaaludes

Ostrich on my seats and ferocious beat in the trunk

And my Chevy shine stupid like I sprayed it with baguettes

You gotta get on my level lil' daddy step up your game
I got speakers all in the grill of my car like im insane
Feel like I got music surgically implanted in my brain
I just chunk the deuce and hit the drank cause I cant hear a thing

The other day I got a ticket listenin' to that hurricane
Soon as the police got out my sight I turned back up the bang
So much vibration in my trunk that my car wont stay in one lane
White people be lookin' at my car like honey thats insane

I pulled up at her house it was her and about six broads

I hopped outta the truck with me and my six boys
Me and my sick clique them boys they hit hard
Speakin' of hittin' hard the trunk makin' some noise
Neighbors callin' the laws cause I done knocked they windows off

When I pull up on the block I'm shakin' the whole ground
If the baby touch my car the baby will fall down
But the trunk hit harder than Tyson in the first round
I got that amazin' base and I wont turn it down

Before you pull up on me boy you better get your head right
Let me show you what I do to haters who wont play it right
Pull up on them boys who be stuntin' at the red light
Open up my trunk on em and see who got they bread right

He thought I was go fight him, but I wus gon shoot a nigga
Now I know that sound fucked up, but I aint got no time
Soon as you whip a nigga he jus' gon go get his iron, his nine, or his rugle, howeva he wanna do ya 
I ain't thinkin', I ain't talkin', I ain't boxing, ima shoot ya
His nine or his rugle, howeva he wanna do ya

I think somebody tryna do me something, I see him lookin'
Come play me like a rookie, watch
How quick I leave you shooken
I hop outta the bushes wit that thang like surprise, and if you
Try to run then that choppa knock off yo thighs
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, take off I'll shoot off

Me an my clique be posted up on the block, what's yo sign (get em up), but back to the
Subject of how these hataz wish me death, 
I peeped the way these niggas try to play me to the
Left
So I keep the ""K"" off in the trunk, I'm heated when I step, 
Cause beefin' ain't beefin' until
You stop somebody breath
And if we creepin, I'm creepin, bussin til it ain't nuthin left
If we creepin', I'm creepin' bussin' 'til it ain't nuthin' left, like dat

I remember one Sunday we hit the scene, it was packed, sittin' on 22's wit the paint wet black
Me an my nigga he got my back, I got his back
Dem hoes standing on top of the car shakin' cat
We finna do a show, so we pull the truck to the back
But when I hit the door, them niggas
Ain't know how to act
Dem hoes grabbin on my chain, pullin on my plaits
Dey want me to take
Em home and hit em from the back
But when we got outside, them pussy niggas was hatin', actin'
Like he wanna do me something but he fakin'
I asked him what it was wit no fuckin' hesitation,
One false move ima leave you shakin on the pavement
I had a funny feeling that something was
Going on, nigga wanna do me something cuz im ridin on chrome

I'm getting money getting money thats all I know

[Verse 1]
Why don't you criticize me for actin' like I act if I ain't never had a thang
My daddy got locked when I was 12 my whole life changed
My momma hustled hard and then had to get the bills paid
While you probably ridin' round the in yo Escalade
But now that I got money I went and bought me 2 mansions
Just to stunt on them niggas who told me I never had it
I walk out the door the other day and my momma told me you got a lot to learn
She told me just because we got all these money to burn don't think I can't be a turned
To go bigger to the streets
So I stay back with some heat
24 hours 7 days of the week cause they free
24 hours 7 days of the week I'm a beast

I'm 18 years old and I done seen more drama than a lil' bit
And don't advise you to talk about it unless you lived it

Tryin' to ball like me
And these is for my niggas who used to roll gold d poppin the trunk on them swangers Hopping out in tall tees so all my niggas that ballin' and feel like me from the struggle and gutta to makin' a live g
Keep my head up remember who got me right where I'm at today as long as I got money I give a damn what a hater say

Need me a gutta chick, who gon keep it gutta with, Hurricane Chris-agist

Really matta hold me down, and that ain't what you doin so you need to move around
I need somebody that's gon' cook for me, fix my plate and rub my back 
But all you do is fuss and fight, like you just don't know how to act 
I'm sick and tired of hollerin', and fussin' and
Fightin', ain't wit it, don't like it, don't do it, not likely

I feel like your comments useless
Nothing to it, but to do it, get your bags and get to it
Get outta my bed, get outta my room, get outta my house,
Get outta my life And you can't come back and holla when you get your mind right, 
'cause as far as I'm concerned you ain't got nothing I like
Need to keep on kickin' and walkin' the other way
Please stay outta my face, 
I ain't got nothing to say, but Ay Bay Bay I say that in every phrase
This supposed to be a sad song, but I said Ay Bay Bay
And I can't stand the way you act when people hang up in your face, what that got to do with me, that's your phone anyway
Why in the hell would I give them your number to catch myself up in my game, 
I am not lame, I got game, H-U double R - I to the Cane
So get your things hope on the bus you came, I think it's by time you swang
And do your thing everything gon' be okay, everything gon' be okay

Get the hell up outta my sight, lil' mama you think I'm lien, here some money
For a cab hope you have a nice ride

She took me in the bathroom pullin' on my zipper
I bent her over from the back and hit her with the missile
I be-um be-um be-um and I didn't mean kiss her
I beat it out the frame you know I'm hurricane
Then I dipped off in the middle of the night in the range switchin' lanes

Go Live entertainment
See the gold bangin'
Walk like that cause I talk like that
I walk like that cause I talk like that
All you out there fakin' better chill out (hold up)

[Chorus: x2]
Why you walk like that?
Cause I walk like that
I walk like that
Why you talk like that
Cause I talk like that
I talk like that
Cause I talk like that

Look at my pants
Look at my shirt
Look at my shoes
Look at my feet
I walk like that cause I talk like that
I walk like that cause I talk like that
You just said the same thang
I just said the same thang

I'm from Louisiana you could tell by the accent
Well I'm a get in the doors on impalas with the phantom kits
Pull up at the party hop out and get it started
Plus I'm full of Bicardi I think I'm getting nauseous
Now I'm feelin' retarded
Looking for a broad to go get another broad
And then I'm a get it stared
Talk like I talk
And when I walk I be mobbin'
And gun pumpin' to get you stumped it ain't a problem

[Chorus: x2]

I walk like this cause there's a lump in my pants
And when I hit the club they call me the money man
I hit the V.I.P that when I spend a couple grand
Then I walk on the floor with a couple stacks in my hand
Lil mamma got to poppin' and pullin' all on my waist
That's when I took my shades off and let her see my face
The shirt that I got on the same brand as my cologne
The same ratchets on my phone I can't help it I'm a dog
I go harder than the average take a trip to Paris
30in with candy-paint on the Volkswagen
Pants stay saggin' can't help it I'm just rachet
Money make me happy hoes like my swag
And I get it from my daddy black on black in that caddy
Walk like dis cause I used to walk home
But now I walk to the parkin' lot to see I sit on chrome
26's yea I'm sittin' on that chrome

I look you in the grill

But please don't try to tell me
What I can not see
What's the real definiton
Of A Fake MC

Muthafuckas only rappin since 93
And expect all props

Them gettin dropped like hot rocks
""So stop what you doin cause I'm
About to ruin"".....
Like Shock-G get turned to stone
Tryin to rock me
I separate my thought process
From stress, 24 tracks inside my brain
Tyrin to maintain
I bang shit without no gang or jherri curls
I seem like Kadeem
In a whole different world
It's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves
Forgettin who they are
When they try to be that superstar
They don't understand
It's all in the game plan
Exploit the art
And watch Hip-Hop fall apart
But I'm a do my part, and stay true
And keep breakin down bitch niggas like you

Leavin muthafuckas stretched out

Like nicotine, never get me clean
From your blood stream
We all can't bust, so do it how you must
But if you hustle, avoid gettin rushed
With hand cuffs plus
In got we trust but don't trust us, we just
Add to the ashes, then pick up the dust

Like you havin bad dreams
Have you wakin up out your sleep
By your own screams
Xzibit has arrived Goddamit

We bout to rock the whole planet
And bitch niggas can't stand it
Try to play the back and look intense
You need to hit a fence
You don't want none of this
Hands on experience
I'm no the type to play games
Or drop names I just
Maintain and drop rappers out the frame

No mas o menos, simply stacks affect tracks
So set the move back

Why si me miras en los ojos recojo puro respeto 
Why las palabras de mi boca empezaron enlocesos
Asi lo es homeboys, I'm puttin dantas con mi clicas

Ton touch sound doofy eatin fajitas 
Chillin' in the B-boy stance 
In my Adidas 
While senoritas be screaming Buenos Dias 
Rock steady by now you know the steelo 
Mi correo still gets down on the leelo 
Tahino indians welcome to my teepi 
Pop in the CD and let's get freaky 

Boriquia, about to pass it off to the rasta 
It's the el generalno 
Tell your baqua where's the hydro 
If the chocolito make my eyes low 
BC a tomb bab with me and my man 
Trying to double our ends with the el capitain 

Undressin' me, thinking about sexin me 
While I 

Blazing, kicking lingo with this bingo 
Who got hot making the peicos out in santo domingo 
El socio, used to go to the acopulco 
Every weekend tricking on chulas, he was beatin 
But on the streets of Harlem around the grand concourse 
He had to force a loco, with amigos he used to boss 
A dios mios, just like el ninos 

Harlem got the pace in it (boogie, boogie got the cake in it) 
Crooklyn keeps on takin' it (queens cats been making it) 

I do this for my soldiers in the streets 
Who stand toast to toast with the cousin asleep 
Making illegal transactions 
World-wide connections 
Forced up a change like the name smif-n-wessun 
See me coming through and my nigga clef too 
Or the 650 blowing up the Grant's Tomb 
Mobb beats to protect slaying your street bite 
Like a killing, over-dealing for the pearly white 

Blows down your mother fucking roof 
It be hurricane g, subwoofin' out ya asshole 
From first staff, up through parks from the heart 
They better stand though and my niggas up in Spanish Harlem 
Who don't give a fuck and my box stuck cutting up tribal 
Forget the hydro, 'cause we gonna keep it live all night yo 
Yeah one love to my fam in boriquia land 
My emanitos sparking up trees 
112 buddah keys barking up Puerto Rican queens 
Smacking all rice and beans 
And you know my emanitas keep it real 
In timboso high hills 
All my pitycitas who ain't fucking around 
Sontaras holdin shit down for the crown 
Tony touch, cocoa brovaz and I 
Keep the body all high 
No doubt 
If he CPR in the mother fucking house 
I'm talking about crazy Puerto Ricans 
Who beefing 
A few heads is busted because I see them leaking 
Freaking, because I be frying bitches up like hoochie fritos 
For my five bitchulitos 
Yo, yeah word up and if you can't get with it then kiss my a*s 
But your, on thea real I want to say one love and rest in peace

You got to keep bubblin on em
Platinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas
Hey yo, I bumped into these cat an' they was like,
""Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice""
I said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice
You public enemy number one right now
But Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit

Let's go
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear
Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be  you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs  they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because i'm public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun 
Cause they got me public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
You know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because i'm public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? and thats just the way the story goes
And thats just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Susie meets the man of her dreams.
He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind
He doesn't want the company

Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand as the rain puts a tear in his eye.

Cries into the leather seat
And Susie knows the baby was a family man,
But the world has got him down on his knees

So she throws him at the wall and kisses burn like fire,
And suddenly he starts to believe
He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why,
But he thinks that he begins to see

Hush,"I take a deep breath and unload every thought 
Everything I've ever known anything I was taught 
When I think I'm on a roll I have to slow down 
Cuz my words get ahead of myself I know how 
To make you feel how I feel my words are so vivid 
See how I live it all I got to give is 
My pain my stress one blade and one knife 
Ends with one slice my name and my life 
All rests with my sons so they can do better 
I need to be here so we can be together 
But life is so hard seeing through these eyes 
A world with no heart believing these lies 
Can you be strong before your times up 
Looking to find what you've made your mind up 
There has to be a change so my seeds can reach 
Anything they can grasp anything to teach 

CHORUS 
I got 24 hours to live my whole fate 
All I have left in my heart is one take 
One breath one sigh one death and one try 
One more reason to ask God why? 
It's my life it ends when I say 
So until my time is up on that day 
I'll do what I gotta do live how I wanna live 
Be who I wanna be prove what I gotta prove 

Verse 2 
It's not so funny how we live each day 
Wake up go to work come home in replay 
We say we love life inside it's untrue 
Unless you got dollars aside it's not you 
I used to wake up call in or just quit 
Cuz I couldn't stand a boss in my face for dumb shit 
You know what I mean that boss with no life 
No sense no friends no kids and no wife 
Career motivated on an hourly wage 
Me well see I'm on a whole other page 
I gotta make money man fuck I got kids 
Whose father and uncles in time have done bids 
Iced out homies only preserve thugs 
To get what's deserved or they deserve slugs 
If murder was the case that they gave me 
Dear God I wonder can you save me 

CHORUS 

Verse 3 
What if in one blink you could end all the pressure 
Built up inside no one bares to measure 
To pain to hide inside with no stress 
No tears to be cried outside and no less 
Make it all wash away with one scream 
One shot one bullet one love and one dream 
Gone to a place where mouths never speak 
But thoughts convey words peep the technique 
My time is coming watch me when I shine 
I strive for something watch me when I rhyme 
Thoughts race through my head like track stars 
A hudred miles an hour inside like fast cars 
I can't slow down if I do it's all gone 
Everything I've done up 'til now and this song 
Ends right here my life and no fear 
My fight and my struggle to die with no tears

I walk this planet the most rugged
Most can only see this heat but don't touch it
Cuz' you might get 'em burned
When I come through it's my turn
Never get in my way or you're getting' rolled over
Like Rover cuz' my fist's a bulldozer

Like a heartbeat playing against piano keys

Turn around and you might catch these so justt freeze
A riddle with no clues I'm a walking nightmare
Anywhere anytime boy I don't fight fair
A day in my shoes is a day with no fear
So walk barefooted and save your whole year
And I wear a mouthpiece cuz' I grit my teeth
So just bite your tongue before you get your ass beat?

In the street wit' a beef in the heat

Don't matter if you win or you lose
Only one thing to do
EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
Put it down every town every city
If you feel me and you wit' me
EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!

Verse 2
I'm an S.O.B.
That's a son of a bitch homie you don't know me
I was put here to slap you silly and clap Billy
And clap everything in the track like Mac Milly's
And that's just the half really
You don't wanna see the other side I suggest you act quickly
And ran swiftly and get outta my way before the gats empty
(C'MON!!!) and just tempt me?

My crew is all fired up
Y'all better just wise up
Everybody gettin' sized up

Start runnin' your times up

Hush,"I'm the next new kid not on the block
But I will knock your block off quick not with a glock
But two guns and knuckles that bring pain
It's a shame you couldn't spit venom on my name

Is it worth all the fame and money it's no joke
I done came from nothing to something it's so funny
How you could just start at the bottom so hot
Til they see you at spot when you got no product

And the crowds do flock to see you
And the shot you got and it's hot to be you
And shocked to see through all the squat they feed you
You did not squeeze through in a plot they need you

The dude calling shots at the top could be you
Unless you get got and the rest it rings true
It's just the beginning of pain and my glory
Starts when I finish the end of this story

Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)

We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
We put 'em down, put 'em down put 'em down now
We put 'em down, uh!

See I float like a butterfly, you could fly like a bee
With a sting but could never fight me
Call it Bulletproof, Teflon with a voice
And track that hard just to put it through

'Cuz it's a banger comin' in showin' the middle finger
Once I begin to flow you'll know anger
One dagger sharp with the tongue, I walk with a swagger
You seem to stagger

One slip of the jaw and Hush I'm Quick Draw McGraw
'Cuz me I see all see y'all fallout
Ballout on the streets and seize all
And beef I breath for

Try me lyrically I'll bully and squeeze off 'til fully
See y'all I'll risk it
When your dogs to limp for bizkits call for this shit

Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now

I'm here, you've been waiting for me
You've been waiting to see, now that I'm here
I'll be right on the top of things, no you don't want it now
'Cuz we be poppin' thangs, no you don't want it
I said, ""No you don't want it now""

When I'm to hot you're lovin' it
When I'm not you're just not into the plot with no slug in it
Just not shot with a glock or Tupac in it
Must not be in a squad with no thug in it

'Cuz I'm a breakthrough where I take you
Now I will shake you up like a quake and make it so painful
Pistols ain't playful it's the way crews act they erase you
If I'm to face you I'll replace you quick

When I spit shit that's so graceful Mase will embrace you
So you better pray Jesu sways your way just to save you
Me I will never die, but I will live on in any song long as forever I
Live for the agony and defeat whatever it is I meet with no tragedy

Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now

We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
We put 'em down, get up
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
We put 'em down, oh

And what ever it is then that's what is gonna be nigga
Hussein Fatal, the outlaw don, ""Blood In My Eyes""
Shyea', Triple O stand up, Got your mind's back right
Jerse's mobbin' these cowards all the time

You know gunning them down, Every thing like that
Smooth stayin' forty below on these cowards, early nigga

Get down and lay down, Draw heat and protect your self
Rule' holla at yo' peoples nigga..

[Verse 1 Ja Rule]
For now on call me the don, and bicthes call me don da da
Where ever I go niggaz soon to follow'
Like when I dropped my first joint making the world ""Holla""
I kept it ""Between Me And You""

'Cause that what real street niggaz do
""Put it on Me, cause even thugs get lonely
Sometimes ""I Cry"", fo' niggaz I'm a baptized
When will they realize I ""Live It Up""

Cop tha coke sell it and re' it up
I'm ""Always On Time"" got bitches ""Memsmerize""
From the ""Thug Lovin"" load the clip
Cock back the nine, open mouth shove it

Look in his eyes, and squeeze like fuck it
And just to think my niggaz do this shit for nuthin'
When my wild Rule' thuggins, lookin' to get a come up
Come on in and catch the angel that's all in

Call me Lord remis' my time, and I'll arrive with
Blood in my eyes

[Hussein Fatal Talking]
That's what real niggaz do you know
We hold it down for each other
We don't waste time we get it done
Why not, Why would'nt we, you know
That what goes down you know
You draw yours, I draw mine
Who ever get the drop that what it is
The object is to get it done, let's go it's nuthin' (Yo)

[Verse 2 Ja Rule]
Fuck tha world and niggaz that proceed to run it
Rule' for prez cause I'm one of the best that done it
On the M-I, these niggaz spittin' semi, to get by
But never really get right, livin off of the hit I

""DMX"" was my dog, but now we just dog fight
Sucking on glass dicks, calling them crack pipes
And I'm hearin' you letting yo' health slide these days
And yo lady's dicked up, and you contracted to aids

Who the fuck you callin' gay nigga, must a been talk to
Em' and ""Dre"", nigga, pour out a little liqour
And rest in peace to ""Tupac Shakur"", cause you let us know
That Dre was a queer before

And ""Marshall"" how dare you use his name in vain
Son of a panther, you'll never understand his pain
But you do understand trailer parks and cocaine
Disrespcting your mother what fuckin part of

The game is that man , I guess this world need change
So we got it, and now I gotta put 'em in the grave
Red, guide 'em before they put us in the cage

Uh huh
Y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
Is y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
I don't think you are
I don't think so!

They got my back against the building
I'm the villian that's creeping around corners
Like shorty you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his fucking dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you
It's murda
It's murda motherfuckers

I take a squat then post up with the toast up
I bring beef to a closure
Know somethin?
From cats stackin four-somes
I'm loathesome 
I scream out fuck the world then I throw something
Niggas scheming hard but fuck it, it's the god
I leave bullets lodged leave you leaning on your broad
And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want?
Daddio with the calico 
Let the gat blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you
I before you

Death before dishonor now and prior to
Boss man spy on you
Conspire you
Me die before you?
You liar, you
Niggas is dead off the hits I approve
Fuck it, I got the feds wearin wired suits

Straight do or die niggas
Caught up and fall victim to the worst shit
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shot on the world and reflect it
Niggas don't respect it
So get it the worst way
Fuck with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day
Now everybody want you
I'm feeling like: stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time
It's murda
Whenever you see blood

Lay you down for the love
That's us 
Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.
Niggas better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murderin' shit

And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin' my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin' up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the ""Inc."" is ""Murderous""
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips
Murder meets gangsta shit

My Murder Inc. mob money, Oprah style
From here back to the block, they get that green
Known to put a hole through a nigga's shoulder soon as the beam glow
Probably graze you in the face, give me a break
I'ma rapper, out here to stay, don't make me do what I say
Just let me say what I do
Cause I'ma put it in a rhyme, every time, about to spray up your crew

Lace shots to the face

Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, cowboys is near
Stampedin' anythin' in our way, we'll attract war
If your smart you'll slide over like handicap doors
I ain't a killer, I just spark a lot
So when I squeeze I'm turnin' your whole block to a parking lot
Understand I'm the grimy Floy
Wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since '94, that's why cats don't hang around me like Chinese stores
One step ahead of you, get more guys
You strapped with four fours, we pack four fives
Fuck talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if your able to crawl or walk out

I'm in the pop life
So when I pop up in your life, and I pop twice
Get down, I spits more than rounds
And niggas bleed heavier than hoes on they period
This sound gotta movin' ""Faster Than Furious""
But nah I ain't Ludacris
I'm here to let y'all niggas know I ain't new to this
Gun butt your bitch
That's the way I get down, believe my style is Murder

To put a hole in your neck

Yall niggas get alot of heart when you get in the studio, huh?
Get that can the man motherfucker wanna talk shit on the mic
Well do this for me, would you?
Next time you get the notion to talk some shit about an Outlaw nigga
Or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas sayin somethin on a record, ha
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'

Ah, from the pressure, yeah
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky

3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranahs or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure

I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me ""I can guarantee you a boss""
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect

Hit the spot and them boys looking, that boys is so lovely
And that boy be popping champagne, that boy be sipping on bubbly
Running thangs, ain't no every day I'm on my campaign

People too hard to figure out, so shit call me a puzzler
Freestyling nigga, boy I be showing charisma

Doing this thing these boys can't mess with me, these boys can't test me
What's left to see, is that boy are-E double D
I'm a star sipping bar in the car, sitting sideways on the highway
Two hundred the fly way, what that boy say
That boy's out of control, that boy balling, that boy top drop low crawling
That boy's nineteen, that boy's not stalling
That boy mash for his green, that boy stacking cash for his dream
That boy last to get the green, that boy too fast on the scene
That boy be moving, that boy in the groove, that boy gon' bust a move
That boy gon' get the girls man, he gon' make 'em all soothe
In a bubble bath in the jacuzzi, might pull a yellow bone floozie
That boy don't understand, 'cause that shit really don't amuse me
I'ma grab the microphone till the mic is gone, I can hit the spot
Like it or not I'm a big shot, fuck it drop

Telling her that I can come through, and I can get her into a interlude
At the same time I can have the tool, that's the microphone the utensil
While I come through the Southside, everybody say man that boy's instrumental
Better yet he's a republican or a democrat, every time he look at
Talking bout man what he have to have, a motherfucking Cadillac
On fo's, and I'm still swanging to the elbows and they sticking out
What you talking bout, what about them boys on Rap-A-Lot
Love to talk about the hoes that I fuck, and I smash and I pass
At the same time every time I receive, they be saying he's tip-toeing fast
Like a motherfucking ninja, or I mean the karate kid
At the same time I can drop the top, and I can go on and drop the lid
I mean I can let it fall, always come through and we still can ball
At the same time I gotta write my name on the wall, 'cause I gotta get a plack
I'm a mack in a Lac ready to attack, I duck on Shaq
Might as well make this boy put his granny, have a cardiac arrest
Using finesse I pop up in the STS, or a Benz
Me and my friends rolling on 20's, I mean three's
At the same time we some G's, sipping on Hi-see
Tropicana, here's the key to the banana, what about the scandalous
And Fraiser that he say, that he made the people

Grab the mic and be screwing

And people say when we got a white cup in my hand, we might toast
I got Hump I got Redd to the side, we'll chunk it up
Uh ain't no drank in the cup, 'cause I done already drunk it up
I'm leaning I mean like a tower, got mo' drank than Doogie Hawser
Stay in Cloverland, I might pull up in the Prowler I'ma call
Get a room for a hour and take a shower, hit the West down to press
Pass a girl I can tell I must confess, I must manifest
I learned about the constitution, I learned about all this stuff
I learned about that you can get diamond baguettes, princess cuts or crushed
I got a piece I got a crease, nigga I look nice in it

Get a cut, nigga I pimp a slut on the cut
Man I got great pass and struts, pull up in a brand new Lexus truck
With Screw eating on barbecue, like Master P say Hoody ho
Nigga I stay Sucka Free, but uh I might just stay T-are-you
Wear FUBU and Kinner Ko and Jabos, I keep a crease
These people say god damn Flip, you got a car you don't ever have a lease
See I can pay the whole price, I look nice nigga I just do it
Nigga I break these boys off, smoke sweets no embalming fluid
Then I wreck I recollect, do a song with J-Mack
Uh to describe my house in one word, nigga I'm living so laid back
Now I got a escalator, matter fact I got the common denominator
I pull up, I make a movie like Arnold Schwarzengger
The Terminator or The Predator, nigga I wrote a book I'm the editor
Them boys be saying, Flip always be ahead of his competitors
'Cause these boys can't flow, these boys be saying I'ma come down
And I'ma break these boys off, and get down like James Brown
Or Chucky Brown or Troy Brown, I could make me another movie
In the jacuzzi and blast like a uzi, nigga I get free in the movies
'Cause I always at Loogie's, I be eating on Tuesday's I might shrimp fettuccine
Pull up in the Lamborgini, like Aladdin I got a beanie like a genie

And people say when I fill up my Jag, nigga it's gas unleaded

These niggas want to mug me, these niggas want to love me 'cause I'm in a Lexus
From Texas, these boys be staying on the Southside ain't no plexers

Or I might go to the club, and say uh give my D-tape to the DJ
He'll play it I'll say it, get the mic and I'll wreck it, them boys be like
Lil' Flip you got so much money, you don't never have to go on naked
Nigga I got Mariah Carey, nigga I got all the fine girls

Like BG, nigga it's gon' be a bling bling
Nigga I'ma have to talk on my walkie talkie, when my Nextel ring ring
And if I don't want to talk, nigga I ain't gon' even answer the phone
Nigga I be doing like I gotta do, nigga you can cancel that home
See I got a home in Roam, I got a phone that got three way
You want to see Lil' Flip run through them like a, TSU relay

Hustle Gang,"Ay, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a ""69""
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck""
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down

She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested, damn!

Like the camera rollin' and them people on us
You know it

Middle finger out the Beamer like Pac
One hand on my dick, one hand on my Glock
All gas through the dash, I'o'nt plan on stoppin'
Got a mouth full'a gold, shirt off I'm Pac
Still ridin' with my nigga with a thug's habbit
My other nigga drinkin' lean 'n' got a pot belly
Now we ain't finna play no games, not at all, period
They hit ya ass long range like Paul Pierce
'N' drop a song bet ya ass hear it all year

And let's get one thing clear, let's get one thing straight
Came straight up in this bih, move shit up out the way
Put your hands in the air, bitch show me where the safe

Give a foot long to ya bitch, no Blimpie

Orville Redenbacher I'm the only bitch poppin'
And a whole clique 'a yall damn sure couldn't stop it
Runnin' straight to the money that's the only way I'm rockin'
And if yee ain't got that then they might get to poppin'
I ain't fuckin' with the crowd, I'm a different kind of bitch
Go to court and point fingers, you a different kind of snitch
Think I wanna buy a yacht, be a different kind of rich
But I'm still from the hood, I'll settle for a brick

And if I call you a friend, I die for ya
That's even if we don't communicate on Facebook
Man I was raised in the trenches by straight crooks
When lady see me on the street grab they pocketbook
I'm sharp as a pocket knife on IG
This address on my ID
Should tell you I'm from Bankhead, you know not to try me
I put you over my knee
And spank your ass like my niece
And kick ya shit, Tai Chi, until it's over, capisce?

Call 'em Jimmy John's cause them shooters gon' deliver me
Gon' catch ya after hours outside of where you livin' at
Don't forget Tokyo, man we gotta keep it pimpin', man

Betta know I keep a rocket so I'm ballin like I'm Harden
Open up the safe I got it looking like a gourd
Hustle like a mu'fucka fuck what niggas charge
And I came from bein' nothin' now I'm top five startin'
And the game need renovation
Fuck it, no penetration
Money my demonstration, foreigns in my destination

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Hutch,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light

Just disappear
I care for you much too much

Hutch,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Always smiling softly
Such is the habit of my sweet friend

The silver bridle on my horse’s head
Is it enviable, brother-in-law?
Your lambkin staying with me
Is she desirable, brother-in-law?

The golden saddle, rein, and bit
Are they enviable, brother-in-law?
Your precious staying with me
Is she desirable, brother-in-law?

On the shy colt’s head
Bit and rings are rinkling-rinkling
On my young love’s braid
Her braid ornament is swaying-swaying

I long to ride my skewbald horse
On whose flank a mark is branded
I long to meet the beloved girl
On whose fingers rings are stuck",Eki Attar,1994

Remember that tanktop you bought me
You wrote ""You're gorgeous"" on it
You took me to your rented motor car
And filmed me on the bonnet

You got me to hitch my knees up
And pulled my legs apart
You took an instamatic camera
And pulled my sleeves around my heart

Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through

You said my clothes were sexy
You tore away my shirt
You rubbed an ice-cube on my chest
Snapped me 'til it hurt

be changed to protect the record.

St. George: This is the countryside. My name is St. George. I'm a knight.
 Saturday, July 10th. 8:05 pm. I was working out of the castle on the night
watch when a call came in from the Chief. A dragon had been devouring
maidens. Homicide. My job: slay him.

 You call me, Chief?
Chief:		Yes, the dragon again, devouring maidens. The King's daughter may be
next.

St. George:	Mmm-hmm. You got a lead?
Chief:		Oh, nothing much to go on. Say, did you take that .45 automatic into
the lab to have them check on it?

St. George: Yeah. You were right.
Chief:		I was right?
St. George:	Yeah. It was a gun.
 8:22 pm. I talked to one of the maidens who had almost been
devoured.

 Could I talk to you, Ma'am?
Maiden:	Who are you?
St. George:	I'm St. George, Ma'am. Homicide, Ma'am. Want to ask you a few
questions, Ma'am. I understand you were almost devoured by the Ma'am. Is
that right, dragon?

Maiden:	It was terrible. He breathed fire on me! He burned me already!
St. George:	How can I be sure of that, Ma'am?
Maiden:	Believe me, I got it straight from the dragon's mouth.
St. George:	11:45 pm. I rode over the King's Highway. I saw a man. Stopped
to talk to him.

 Pardon me, Sir. Could I talk to you for just a minute, Sir?
Knave:		Sure, I don't mind.
St. George:	What do you do for a living?
Knave:		I'm a knave.
St. George: Didn't I pick you up on a 903 last year for stealing tarts?
Knave:		Yeah. So what? Do you want to make a federal case out of it??
St. George:	No, Sir. We heard there was a dragon operating in this
neighborhood. We just to know if you've seen him.

St. George:	Mmm-hmm. Could you describe him for me?
Knave:		What's to describe? You see one dragon, you seen 'em all.

want to get the facts, Sir!

St. George:	I thought you'd never ask. A Dragonet.
 3:05 pm. I was riding back into the courtyard to make my report to
the lab. Then it happened. 			 It was the dragon.

Dragon:		Hey! I'm the fire-breathin' Dragon! You must be St. George, right?
St. George:	Yes, Sir.
Dragon:		I can see you got one of them new .45 caliber swords.
St. George:	That's about the size of it.
Dragon:		Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!! You slay me!!
St. George:	That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Dragon:		What do you mean?
St. George:	I'm taking you in on a 502. You figure it out.
Dragon:		What's the charge?
St. George:	Devouring maidens out of season.
Dragon:		Out of season?!? You'll never pin that rap on me!! Do you hear me,
cop?!?!

St. George:	Yeah, I hear you. I got you on a 412 too.
Dragon:		A 412!!! What's a 412?!?!?
St. George:	Over-acting. Let's go.
Narrator:	On September the 5th, the Dragon was tried and convicted. His fire
was put out and his maiden-devouring license revoked. Maiden devouring out
of season is punishable by a term of not less than 50 or more than 300 years.",St. George and the Dragonet,2005

Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees
Yo ho it's hot, the sun is not a place where we could live
But here on earth there'd be no life without the light it gives

We need its light, we need its heat, we need its energy
Without the sun, without a doubt, there'd be no you and me
The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees

The sun is hot
It is so hot that everything on it is a gas
Iron, copper, aluminum and many others
The sun is large
If the sun were hollow, a million earths could fit inside
And yet the sun is still only a middle-sized star

The sun is far away
About 93,000,000 miles away, and that's why it looks so small
And even when it's out of sight, the sun shines night and day

The sun gives heat, the sun gives light, the sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy

Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine
The heat and light of the sun come from the nuclear reactions
Of hydrogen,carbon, nitrogen and helium

Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees

Show me that wonders can be true

Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is - be my guiding star

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking without saying anything

More and more than the air I breathe

I'm letting go, falling into You

The giver of all I'll ever need

You would live inside of me
Come and live inside of me

Hylo Brown & The Timberliners,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,2010

Hymie Shertzer,"Hmm, c'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 

Oh, c'est si bon
So I say it to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh-so good, ba-ba-doo, doo day

Every word, every sigh
Every kiss, dear 
Leads to only one thought 
And it's this, dear!
 
Hmm, it's so good

Just your slightest embrace

Be my own

Through all levels you've been changing
Getting a little bit better no doubt,
The doctor bit was so far out.
Looking through crystal spectacles,
I can see I had your fun.
Doing us paperback reader
Made the teacher suspicious about insanity,
Fingers always touching girl.
Through all levels you've been changing
Getting a little bit better no doubt,
The doctor bit was so far out.
Looking through all kinds of windows
I can see I had your fun.
Looking through all kinds of windows
I can see I had your fun.
Looking through crystal spectacles
I can see I had your fun.
Looking through crystal spectacles
I can see I had your fun.
Rebelling against society,
Such a tiny speculating whether to be a hip or
Skip along quite merrily.
Through all levels you've been changing
Elevator in the brain hotel
Broken down a-just as well-a
Looking through crystal spectacles,
Ah, I can see I had your fun.

What do I see?

I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like ""sure""
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: ""Ooh-Dee-Whoo""
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi how you say, ""voulez vous?""
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I mange, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically ""yes""
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her ""why you stare"" - that's a ""yes""

Situation's gone bad for you niggaz claimin' killaz
Automatic triggaz pullin', drillin' holes inside your liver
How you figure, I was gon' let you talk that shit
And peep these streets sayin', ""That ScanMan boy's a bitch""

Killin', buckin', buckin' up in gunfire
Bullets rickin' off the walls, nigga this is warfare
Suckaz claimin' they got nuts
You don't know these elephants
Specialize in takin' notes, specialize in nappy hoes

Niggaz this is serious, I can't play no games no more
Niggaz actin' curious but I think they know the score

Hold it up strong, only those, who stay real, or maintain' in this game

a lot of niggaz talk that shit and end up gettin' the wig split
It's MC Mack, the nigga known for smackin', jackin', Cracker Jacks
Busta ass nigga, run you mouth and get your ass blowed off
Watch me put my ski mask on

Come a gat back now trick now drop it off
Shoot a super soaker in a minute
Don't you give a fuck about another nigga
If he's speakin' use your counter attack

Rollin' like a nigga smack a nigga like a nigga
Smack a bitch, you crump, you ain't no busta
Ain't no love lost off in my heart, there's no place colder
Won't you come a little closer nigga, you won't be rollin' our

Started rivalries civil, homies swithin', actin' fickle
But if you fuck with family ties, we leave you triple

That nigga there know his gun a missile
Lord don't flash on him, only man ain't chival
Erasin' ample businesses all in the name of the T-Rock
Suckaz eat pot, swallow D, and get punished for three rocks
Bangin' the hit stops, it won't be over, 'til your heat pops
Away from the gravity, stand and point your a tech and see him drop

Yeah, I know, I know, down, down, baby goin' down, down
Sweet dreams baby, rock-a-bye, baby

Ridin' with my congregation and we smokin' on marijuana

If you wanna go to war with us, we prepared to bust
Caught that niggaz slippin' at his place, shot him in his face
Now I race, from the scenery, blowin' on greenery
Know I got a temper but you tricks wanna be mean to me

It's the weak, told to tell 'em, Julius Caesar, how he rolls
Newspaper, told to tell 'em, how he just got lnocked of his toes
You should know, that we rollin' deep, hittin' like a train
Kiss the floor, don't be lookin' dumb 'cause I don't explain

But boy choose them carefully
Each of my poisons 
Are deadlier melodies
I am the doctor
And this is your therapy
You can have one
So you must get a pair of these
Beat, bound and gagged
Bump off bounty
Place all his pieces

And plus platinum plaques to match
And add them twenties and vogues

And wanna rise in the hood
It's cold I'm crankin' up heat
And you wish you could
Y'all wish y'all could get back with us
Then maybe then you could shine
Like the rappers you wish you was
And get off the grind
I'm keepin' one in the chamber
Because I'm filled up with anger
And when I see yo little hoe 'n'
You knowin' your life's in danger
I do a show y'all in the burough
Hollerin' no kind of shit

To get attention lil bitch

They feelin' that they left out
And we the ones movin' on

And one day then you'll get a crown

To battle and crush the holy war

Hell is here, no escape
Hell is here, Mother Nature's raped

Fueled by the hate we plow across the burning nation
With blood dripping from our hands only to keep the essentials from our past
The great army of the black horde is marching on
Through the remains of the slaughtered men

Lives flushed down the drain, bodies left to rot

Blood that was spilled, obliterated mankind
Life's lost
There's nothing left to claim

satu jokaiselle työt
ja töiden jälkeen yhä useammin iltaisin

lasin pohjaan tuijotin

mä itse tunsin kokeneeni saman kohtalon
eipä ollut virkaa enää
tumma puna peitti nenää
ja rannalla mä yksin istuin nousuun Auringon
kun lähelleni näin mä naurulokin kaartavan
niin tiesin että jotakin nyt vihdoin oivallan:
Siinä sielu on sen miehen
jonka työt jää puolitiehen
ja joka kaiken rakentaa vain varaan unelman

Mut albatrossi joka lepäämättä liitää

And in that moment
Between two worlds

You spoke in silence
And you made it clear
Walk in peace now

Into the blackened meadows

It brought us here to end our days
Countdown for the walls of time
The age of light will pass away

The storm race against us
A thousands days of misery
All fall in twilight
Burning for eternity

Blasting flames in the sky
Waiting for that moment

Spread your wings across the sky
To the end of the earth
Riding at the speed of light

All end in damage

Devoted to the darkness
Driven by the force that reigns

Cursed we are to die as men
Beneath the gods of ice and sand
Cursed we are all

Seventeen mountains stood so high.
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made you cry
You said the devil told you that another mountain would appear
Every time somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would one day overflow with all your tears,
And love will always leave you lonely

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, you and me

Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,
Happiness sometimes hard to find. (yeah)

That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound,
To one night hear the sound, of you calling,
Do not stumble through tonight, 
Have no fear of falling.

And if nobody got lost,
And if no-one paid the cost,
The price of this you may summize, is forever after,
We won't stumble through tonight drowning in their laughter.
We won't stumble through tonight drowning in their laughter.

From these moments, we awake,
Our heads clear of the mistakes,
How we never hit the brakes, or felt it stalling,
Just don't stumble through tonight,
Have no fear of falling.
No don't stumble through tonight,

Under the arches, somethings still moving,
We lie together, forever and ever,

Now this house is haunted, now look in the ruins,

The day they'll discover, you're still with me my lover,
The creedence is craving, the truth be uncovered,
I sent them your letter, that read like a lecture,
There on the pages, the laughter, the rages.

This house is haunted, the face in the mirror.

Kiss me and shiver, one day they'll discover,

I carry their DNA 
We are representatives of a long line of people 
And we carried them around either with 
This long line of people 
That goes back to the beginning of time 
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people 
And we say bring together the lines of me 

When I look back over the years 
At the things that brought tears to my eyes 
Papa said we have to be wise 
To live long lives 
Now I recognize 
What my father said before he dies 
Vocalize things I've left unsaid 
Left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where I can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestry 
Givin' me continuity 

Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
Would you rather I quit 
Come with that other shit
Making people's hips sway 
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous 
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
Like a lifeline, I light lines 
'Cause my compassion is deep 
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep
And this is who I happen to be 
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be

Remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you 
Reduced to tears 
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that's right 
My name Rob 
I'm the one 
Who landed the popstar's job 
I'm the one who 
You told look, don't touch 
I'm the kid 
Who wouldn't amount too much. 

I believe in the senses that I sound 
I have always been too loud 
Won't you help me drown it out? 
And When I feel 
What I'm feeling is so real 
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel
Always digging in my heels 
Now I got the faith to 

Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 

Ha, lace up your booty 
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude 
Feed freakin' for loot 
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now 
And your forefathers further know how 
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred 
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best 
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth

This is what my Daddy told me

Going light speed traveling
Stick around if you want me to fix you good
Put the pill in your mouth and don't worry what it is you having
Better days are soon to come to you

Locking up time out in the country
With a doctor watching
Did his best now it's not really working no more
Got my tongue tied to the ceiling and my finger touching
Afraid that I might hit the floor

Came around when I sat at the doorstep, I could see you waiting
Come in and I'll give you the 411
In between what I did and you said, lights were fading
All the things I know to be undone

I Killed the Prom Queen,"You wore out your welcome, like you wore me, to the bone.
Outside the mood is absent and silence provides no solace.
I offer no shelter from the dead night air.
Just a tomb to call your own.
In this falling fortress.
Awake me from this broken dream.
Your god won't lead you tough today.
He only hears your cries as a chorus to a lullaby.
Your faith has fallen before your eyes.
A mindless cage that keeps you suffocated and on your knees, lonely, wanting more.
He preaches another love song, temporarily blinded by lies.
You taken beauty from these words.
Rewrite your own mind in this war.
You wore out your welcome like you wore me down.
You are an image without form.
...And in this moment my heart collapsed...
You smashed it apart.
He preaches another love song, temporarily blinded by lies.

Everything you love will pass away.
Everything you hold in your heart is frail.
It will perish in a wall of flames.

Ill show you exactly what its like, to feel alive.
As you gaze up at the sky, as your frail hands reach out for mine.
I have forced myself to look away...
As all hope is lost, as you gaze up at the sky.
Ill show you exactly what it's like to feel alive.
We'll paint it black and blue, as a painful reminded of the black heart that's beating inside you, bleeding inside you.
Among the merciful, sin will reign.
Only guilt will crush us all...
And when we face the end we'll find the deepest sleep.
In graves we dug ourselves.
Ill make sure you never sleep again.
The air around us has become a threat to swallow.
These words are uttered in contempt and spat out like poison.
I hope you rot down to the core.
From many years of misery I'm torn in two.
We'll paint it black and blue, as a painful reminded of the black heart that's beating inside you, bleeding inside you.

And I couldn't care anymore.
I've never had it to hold, so I've got nothing to lose.
Young love left you broken hearted.
""We could have never had us, because I never had you"".
So let your eyes tell the tale.
What I was meant to say.
I thought of you for too long.
Now a frozen smile... won't even bring you back.
Your kiss is no longer safe to me anymore.
Your lips have turned into something I don't know anymore.
They are the gates to a vicious tongue.
Your razor wrists won't make this change or go away.
Id never trust those bloodshot eyes...
This love was living with its eyes sewn shut.
At times I'd love to bludgeon you and dance with your corpse.
Yesterday's memories left me weak.
I'm chasing shadows, wasting time, waiting for Vegas to call my name.
Idle thoughts spill constantly, from open mouths, with their eyes sewn shut.
I hope this haunts you like it does me, be-sides and broken smiles won't dance with me.
Idle thoughts spill constantly, from open mouths, with their eyes sewn shut.

I Killed the Prom Queen,"Storm clouds hanging over head
Offer not the slightest bit of comfort
For the first time in days
I wait to discover
Disasters that I've slept through
While I felt so alive

So we say goodbye
So we say goodbye
Heartstrings severed just as quick
As they were discovered
So we say goodbye
So we say goodbye
I'll break my own fall to keep you picture perfect
Just don't wake me up now

so say goodbye
Close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong

the silence she whispers to me
Telling me things we dare to speak out loud
The collaboration of the blinding sun
Through vacant streets hits home hard
Like a hatchet to the skull
I'd keep you here if you kept me warm
And these winters away
Your hands were the only hands needed to hold me
For the first time in days
I feel alive

in the end we will both rot together
In the end we rot toegether
Our love lies in embers

say goodbye
Close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong

peering out of those same cracked windows
That I studied for day upon days
Suddenly collapse
It all falls down

say goodbye
Close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong




",Say Goodbye,2006
I Killed the Prom Queen,"If I ruled the earth I'd sail ships over seas till sundown.
Then I'd return in dark to walk these streets alone.

By day I hear the serpents calling me
This leads me from the shore in search of the deepest abyss.
I am forever covering my tracks, I'm standing hear with little less than an existence.
Though I hold the keys to everything.

This sinking feeling never dies.
I'll chase my sunset laced with pride in this heartless gallion.

Although I'd rather fill my lungs and rapidly descend.
And lay with my thoughts under a bleak starlight.
I'll keep pushing on though this perpetually darkness.
Then in hell I'll seek my confidence.

Then I'd return in dark to walk these streets alone.
The twilight here won't embrace my words like waves do.
The feeling of dryland is making me sick.
So I stand here coughing up sharks till
My neon glowing neck breaks

This sinking feeling never dies
I'll chase my sunset laced with pride in this heartless gallion

Walking through the dark hears to a new beginning.
It's time to bow your heads to a nations swinging axe.
While you search for answers planted in the ground.

I'm happy watching you dance your legs down to your knees.
I'm happy watching you be inflactuated with love.
I'm happy watching you... watching you die

This war with myself never ends.
This war with myself never...

The only way I'd return is to an orchestra on wolves.
The only way I'd return is if I ruled the earth.

Peer into my chest.
See if, this things still ticking.
Another victim, to that power that no one gave you.
Standing all alone, I've realized I'm not giving up.
The first time this touched me, I became, an invention called zero.
So as I walk from this earth, I'm taking you with me.
Existence will fall.. down.
Betrayed, security.. fails.
All hail your faithless god.. lies.
Slain upon thy faithful sword.. trust.
I will not bow.
Compassion is locked inside, and I'm holding the useless key.
So here I stand, just waiting for nothing.
Peer into my chest, rip me apart.
As this lethal injection runs cold, through my veins.
Lights in my head slowly fade out, I'm in the dark again.
There will be no tolerance, for those with no respect.
Standing all alone, I've realised, I'm not giving up.
If I walk this earth, ill still take you with me.
I'm sure these keys will open.
A vile passion..
Praying hands won't save purity.
Praying won't save purity.
As this lethal injection runs cold, through my veins.
Lights in my head slowly fade out, I'm in the dark again.
All hail your faceless god.
Slain upon thy faithful sword.
All hail your faceless god.
Slain upon thy faithful sword.
Still I refuse to bow.

I have been awake kissing these clock faces
The fear of sleep has left me tired and worn.
But in her dreams is where I will haunt her

I've seen the shadow of this burning angel.
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes
I'll pick up the pieces when you've failed and fallen to the ground.
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears,
It will be ok.

I took to the sky, did you mourn for me?
Well who needs flowers when they're dead and buried
For now my whisper is my dearest friend.
But even I no it won't last forever

This princess of pain can be ended elegantly.
With no distaste, no fear of soul decay.
I felt betrayed for so long.
These failures dragged me down.
I whither away.
I will never forgive or forget, a constant reminder, your lifeless heart on a rope around my neck.
A keepsake from this rusted love.
We are falling fast to the ground.
I'd bite into your face just to be close to your eyes
I've discarded such beauty in a past lifetime.
Ill stitch my own insides to the highest tree.

He balkin' with that new fuckin' sparker
Niggas out here crazy like they Waka

I had to swerve on 'em, I had to swerve
What's the word on them? What's the word?
So can I swerve on 'em? Can I swerve?
I had to swerve on 'em, I had to swerve

I don't like to share my drugs
'Cause all these niggas wanna smoke my bud
Don't nobody have no fuckin' money
They laugh at jokes, ha ha, they think this shit is funny
But ain't nothin' funny at all
I had to make a hundred thousand before fall
I got niggas tryna kick me out my house
I got niggas in the trap like a mouse

I had to swerve on 'em, I had to swerve
What's the word on 'em? What's the word?
So can I swerve on 'em? Can I swerve?
Oh what's the word on 'em? Now I gotta swerve

Now I'm 'bout to fly outta town
I'll be back in September when it's brown
On the leaves but I'll still have that green
I mean my friends kinda know what I mean
We be gettin' fuckin' drunk all the time now
I be tryna be in the High Times now
On the front cover with my fuckin' dojer
I play games bitch I'm PlayStation controller
So let me swerve on em', so let me swerve

You know I had to swerve on 'em, I had to swerve
So what's the word on 'em? Tell me should I swerve?
Because I swerve on 'em, yes you know I swerve
So what's the word on 'em? Can I swerve?
You know I swerve on 'em, you know I swerve
So what's the word on ' em? What's the word?
Because I swerve on 'em, you know I swerve",Swerve,2014

So I got 'em for you

Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
