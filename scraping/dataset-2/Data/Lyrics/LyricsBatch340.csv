Halfway to Gone,"Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night, black night,
I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.",Black Night,2004
Halfway to Hazard,"Her mama named her Daisy, got it from a magazine
Through the mountains in her white dress, she'd run chasin' me
Thought she was faster 'cause I told her so, even though it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel even though she ain't got wings
'Cause my sweet Daisy loved the hell outta me

There in the back pew of a Sunday morning church
The preacher preachin' Gospel, well, that's when I gave her her first kiss
She told me so even though it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel even though she ain't got wings
'Cause my sweet Daisy loved the hell outta me

She gave me her body, she gave me her soul, didn't ask for nothin'
She led me down to the river, said you need to be baptized
Held me under the moon light; Lord, I don't know why
She loved the hell outta me

Eight years later we got married, and the day her water broke
The doctor said there's complications, but I still had hope
She was gonna make it 'cause she told me so, even thought it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel, and now she's got her wings
Yeah, my sweet Daisy loves the hell outta me

She gave me her body, she gave me her soul, didn't ask for nothin'
She led me down to the river, said you need to be baptized
Held me under the moon light; Lord, I don't know why
She loved the hell outta me, yeah

I thought I'd name her Daisy, in her mama's memory
Through the mountains in her white dress, she runs chasin' me
Thinks she is faster 'cause I tell her so, even though it isn't quite the truth",Daisy,2007
Halfway to Hazard,"Dents in the carpet where the couch used to be
And dust frames remain where the pictures used to hang
I guess she got all the things she needs
She took everything but me

She doesn't love me anymore
I guess it's time to close the door
This empty house on Lost Hope Lane
Don't bring me nothin' but pain
It don't bring me nothin' but pain

I'm gonna burn it down all the way to the ground
Gasoline or kerosene and just one match is all I need
I'm gonna let it go all the way up in smoke
Let the wind scatter them ashes all over this town
I'm gonna burn it down

These four walls were built on love
Now nothin' remains of us
Forever used to live in this place
But now I'll watch it go up in flames
Gonna watch it go up in flames

I'm gonna burn it down all the way to the ground
Gasoline or kerosene and just one match is all I need
I'm gonna let it go all the way up in smoke
Let the wind scatter them ashes all over this town
Burn it down, burn it down

I'm gonna burn it down all the way to the ground
Gasoline or kerosene and just one match is all I need
Let it go all the way up in smoke
Let the wind scatter them ashes all over this town
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down

She got all the things she needs
She took everything but me",Burn It Down,2007
Halfway to Hazard,"Halfway To Hazard with the rain comin' down
I wish I could go home but it's just an old empty house
So I find me a cheap motel room and a bottle of Black Label Jack
They might find me dead by the mornin' but they won't find me lookin' back

Cause there ain't nothin' like whiskey when time's movin' slow
It drowns out the misery, helps me let go
When the truth really hits me, she don't miss me, no
There ain't nothin' like whiskey when a women turns cold

She used to wanna hold me and our fire burned so bright
But it's funny how forever can get up and say goodbye
But I've got the answer to my pain a way to face the truth
Well, I can drown out this heartache, but it's gonna take a hundred proof

Cause there ain't nothin' like whiskey when time's movin' slow
It drowns out the misery, helps me let go
When the truth really hits me, she don't miss me, no
There ain't nothin' like whiskey when a women turns cold

Tomorrow I don't know where I'm gonna be
But tonight at least I'll be free from her memory, yeah

Cause there ain't nothin' like whiskey when time's movin' slow
It drowns out the misery and helps me let go
When the truth really hits me, she don't miss me, no, whoa, no, no
There ain't nothin' like whiskey when a women turns cold
There ain't nothin' like whiskey when a women turns cold, yeah, turns cold",Cold,2007
Halfway to Hazard,"This workin' all day ain't gettin' me nowhere
A breakin' my back won't get it done
I wish I had a dime, I wish I had a dollar
For every dream that I gave up on, y'all

This hammer I'm swingin' is startin' to feel heavy
I clinched my fist when I punched the clock
A little for the bank leaves nothin' for my baby
A pushin' my paycheck around the block

Yeah, I need to go face first into that fresh air
Way up there where the eagle fly
I need to draw the line in that cool clear water
And leave the city behind and get country
Oh, countrified

A fool's gold watch and a lung full of black smoke
Is all I get now for all I gave
My only reward for this broken down body
Was diggin' my way to an early grave

I always dreamed I'd end up on a river
Fast asleep on a mountain high
But I'm stuck down here in this concrete valley
In a sea of bumpers and red tail lights

Yeah, I need to go face first into that fresh air
Way up there where the eagle fly
I need to draw the line in that cool clear water
Leave the city behind and get country
Oh, countrified, double time

Yeah, I need to go face first into that fresh air
Way up there where the eagle flies
I need to draw the line in that cool clear water
And leave the city behind and get countrified
Oh yeah, countrified

And breakin' my back won't get it done

Halfway to Hazard,"Tearing up the earth and knocking down those cornrows
Plowboy and mule and a size twelve steel toe
Workin' up a sweat, gonna meet her at the fishin' hole
She got the bait and I'll bring the cane pole

Let down the tailgate
And tonight she gon' get home late

Yeah, yeah, you call us hicks from the sticks
We don't really give a shit
Hell yeah, little redneck, corn fed, up a hollow, born and bred
Real live southern pride and country 'til the day we die

Styrofoam cooler keeping all them beers cold
Lights on a roll bar shining down a dirt road
Pontoons tied up right up to the floating dock
Girls keep it bouncin', dancin', goin' non-stop

Halfway to Hazard,"Sex and the city and Indian food
Well, I never tried 'em, not until you
But it's lookin' like you left me
With some habits I can't break

I feel kinda guilty whenever I cuss
And I lay in bed at night and I, I think about us
Maybe it's because of all the love
You taught me how to make

You changed me, baby
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me
But then again you might have just gone crazy
Tryin' to love a music man

Well, don't worry, honey
I understand why you went runnin' from me
I guess I really should have seen it comin'
I'll always die by my own hand

Ran into your daddy last Saturday night
I finally admitted, he might have been right
Oh, all the times he told me that
You're just too good for me

You changed me, baby
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me
But then again you might have just gone crazy

Halfway to Hazard,"Was a smoke filled room, was a Friday night
Talkin' to a sweet thing and having me a good time
Went through that door, big Jim walked in
He'd been pushing me around since we was kids

Well, I lowered my hat as he came toward me
I heard him say, hey you, but never saw him swing
Well, he knocked me down on that nasty floor
But something felt different than the times before

'Cause I got back up like my daddy taught
Life's gonna hurt you but you brush it off
Well, now you can't quit, you gotta fight back, son
When you find yourself on the ground, you gotta get back up

I worked ten long years in a deep coal mine
Until the roof caved in and it broke my spine
They put me in a chair and the doctor said
""I hate to tell you, son, you ain't gonna walk again""

So I closed my eyes and I prayed to the Lord
And then a fire ran through me on that moment before

Well, I got back up like my daddy taught
Life's gonna hurt you but you brush it off
Well, now you can't quit, you gotta fight back, son
When you find yourself on the ground, you gotta get back up

When my time comes and they lay me down
In an old pine box in the cold, cold ground
I won't rest in peace too long before
Heaven calls my name and my spirit soars

And I'll get back up when that trumpet sounds
Now there ain't no grave gonna hold me down
I'll meet my father when that day comes
And it's all because and it's all because I got back up",Got Back Up,2007
Halfway to Hazard,"I'm tired of all these questions
You leaving me thinking you're teaching me a lesson
I'm tired of all these games
Of being wrong and feeling ashamed

Well, I'm tired of being angry over you and me

Halfway to Hazard,"You're the angel in my pocket
You're that whisper in my head
You're the perfume on my dirty shirt
The favorite words I've ever said

You're the edge I just stepped off of
You're the sunlight through my window pane
You're the road I wanna break down on
In the pouring rain

'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on

I spent my life just spinning my wheels
But I wasn't getting nowhere fast
You took my foot off the gas
You brought me miles from where you found me
And now I ain't going back

'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on

I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting

Halima,"I'm on lonely street age nearly three
Recently Mama's crying all the time 
Is it because of me or my younger sister, 
Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister, 
Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave 
She took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours. 
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
? Wanted to make the cash
Quick so I had to work real late. 
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three, 
This doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely, 
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track 
If I don't get my family back.

I want my family back

I'm on Lonely Street, number fifty three.
Boarded up property, 
I'll probably get pulled down.
Litter all around inside there's 
No sound and no light.
But yo it gets busy at night, People creeping.
Derelicts sneaking to fix. Speaking.
On the way my timbers creaking,
Roof leaking. And bricks coming loose, 
Knee high in refuse.
But even though I'm a slum,
I'm still of some use.
There was a time when my walls where decorated.
And under my roof children where educated.
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed,
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family.
And no strategy, combats negative equity,
So that's it. Like violence it's drastic.
I'm freaking, and seeking to be 
More than just a house for crack.
Somebody bring my family back, reverence",Bring My Family Back,1999

Hallows Eve,"There exists two worlds for you one is false and one is true
I have lost my shirt my friends paranoid vision,
My brain is mildew I lost reality long ago now I live in a Horrorshow!
Reality is a tightrope trick once fell,
Real beasts devour quick my fictional beasts are real to me my very thoughts
A caustic I lost reality long ago now I live in a Horrorshow!
Truth, fiction, one and the same one is real,
The other to blame I don't care what your bishops say truth
Shall eat the skull of the lame I lost reality long agonow
I live in a Horrorshow!




",Horrorshow,1985
Hallows Eve,"I walked into the room
There came a voice saying aloud
""Thou hast no business here!""
""Your best bets to get out!""
The spirits in my head said
""You don't have to run!""
""You don't have to run!""
I was not afraid of the dead I'd dealt with them before
That's how I got my new life
1000 years ago or more
I knew I must return to this house too much for me
To bear the world outside,
I just can't stand I just can't live out there!
The spirits in my head said ""You don't have to run!""
""You don't have to run!""
She's waiting for you in the upstairs room she's waiting
For you in her bed she's waiting for you
As you're climbing the stairs she's waiting
For you and she's dead!
Close the door feel the presence of Black Magic!
Thinking that you'll never die is so tragic
You hold her close,
You look into her dark eyes
Could this be, the devil in disguise?

Unleashed and let go death to modern music and to all who oppose we'll
Blacken eyes of their severed heads
Dismember them at night we'll
Shove our metal down their throats and show them who is right

Bang your head against the stage
Throw, throw your fist up in the air
Don't worry their downgrading of our leather and long hair thrusting with
A vengeance now we know just what they are we're all metal merchants and

They're soaring they're flying right out of the sky you're hearing
The screams of your comrades and wondering why stare at the skies
As they're starting to land you sob and you cry with your head
In your hands they come without warning no mercy they show soon
You'll be seeing the end of the world alien forces from out of the sky
Conquering all who appear to their eyes they come without warning
No mercy they show soon you'll be seeing the end of the world
You can't imagine what terror they bring a world gone mad where bedlam is king

Under, your under invasion terror unknown to man under,
Your under invasion reeks terror across the land run for shelter
They're moving in soon the world will be seeing the end
You can't imagine what terror they bring a world gone mad

They're soaring they're flying right out of the sky you're hearing the screams
Of your comrades and wondering why stare at the skies as they're starting

Plunging to Megadeath seeking the truth plunging to Megadeath
Searching the youth plunge to Megadeath you live for tomorrow we live
For today our strength's held here within our youth man soars through space
But he still wonders who lies and just who speaks the truth worrying
Won't bring you one bit of good if you die you'll die not at will
You'll soon be feeling the cold hand of doom is your blood beginning to chill?

In your dreams isn't pretty the tombstone lies there at your head
Warriors on horseback from out of the sky coming to take you away

Ever lie does your brain ever fry there are no rules let the thunder cry
Mean let the gods make a scene how can you fight it out throw your head
Back and shout there are no rules what gives you the right to stand up and
Fight there is only one rule though it may sound cruel there are no rules
The wages of sin have the highest wage take a trip through hell cause the
Demons to rage there are no rules every generation bears a soldier of the
Truth who marches through the realm setting fire to every roof yelling
There are no rules and as the flames leap high into the stormy night he
Leaps onto a log and laughs at the masses burning bright yelling there are
No rules feel the flame in my voice
Do you have any choice but to
Reach out for the sky grab the sun you may no die there are no rules let
The armies of the land march on till their damned my fetus will not spill
On the ground that they till there are no rules shake your god by the robe
Tell him what you intend that's what it's gonna be he'll know in the end
That there are no rules there are no rules there are no rules there are no

",Valley of the Dolls,1985
Hallows Eve,"Death and insanity a flicker in the flame
Death and insanity are you truly sane?
Do you ever wonder when you're lying in your bed
Deep dark thoughts of trances coming flying through your head
You know you're truly stable but could your thoughts be the truth
A horde of groping parasites to haunt you in your youth

Sitting in the shadow of your stone cold padded cell
You dream the macabre dreams that you have come to know so well
Brain is pumping harder and about to hear the shriek
Of warriors wielding demon swords and death is what they seek

Could this really be the truth or is it really real?
Is it the depths of hell I see or insanity I feel
The triumphs of my dying mind shall overcome at last
Wicked evil leering eyes shall see me to my death",Death and Insanity,1986
Hallows Eve,"Death and insanity a flicker in the flame
Death and insanity are you truly sane?
Be careful of what lies within or what you just might find
Evil beings who have come to sacrifice my mind
People try to rearrange me they will never see
The fear and the insanity that lies inside of me",Death and Insanity (Reprise),1986
Hallows Eve,"As the madman we all know who writhed on a crucifix
I too have been sacrificed by death and her tricks
Pursue the grail to make a wish and drink from the goblet of gore
Souls are but small giblets please death care for more?
In my anger ten more pills shall I gather seven hills?
Lock the horns into place call upon the human race
And I would pray: bitch which art in heaven above hallowed be thy name
Thy violence come mayhem be done on earth as it has in rome
Give us this day our daily gore forgive us for being poor
Cause maybe if we pay enough we can wield upon the whore!

I met an alter side of myself he said I don't know all but I'm learning
I'm tired of quiet revolution I feel a violent yearning
So gather your masses be masters of your fate
Be all that you sow there is war in the shadows I am the master of hate
Delivering the final blow!
We the people shall destroy!
The whore my lord she shall not want she eateth though I wield
She creates the bondage we are sheep in her field
Her cup runneth over with my blood and she wants more
Death I am your filthy grail your goblet of gore
All that I sow, of this horrorshow!",Goblet of Gore,1986
Hallows Eve,"Out of love out of mind out of food out of time
Those who live do not care a taste of war a taste of death
Die!
Live for the cross it has been said but in the end aren't we all dead
Death has come from 'cross the sea now realize reality

Time out of mind, carnage butchery leaving life behind lethal tendencies
Die!
Those who rest, the kiss of death is upon most every face
Feel the fire from the sky to diminish the human race
Die!
There lies no one here but me bloody bodies in the debris
Before I breathe my final breath peer into the face of death

Genocide they take you down to the burning pit of hell
You realize you're wondering what's the burning that you smell
Could it be the dying world or could it be the pit?
For if this is my hell for me then maybe I need it",Lethal Tendencies,1986
Hallows Eve,"Taking you down to the dark depths of hell fire lies under your feet
I am the ruler of this dark domain murder is what I now seek
Demons above you are flying on high eternal death to come soon
Welcoming you to their fiery home welcome the legions of doom

Torture, waiting to die torment, you scream and you cry
Evil, in my eyes death, in the black of the night
Souls into bondage I take one by one behold their screams and their cries
Innocent victims lined up down the way each one is waiting to die
Only the evil survive in this place who have knowledge of the carnal soul
Death to the hungry now death to the weak I am in total control

Only the memories of lives they have spent linger in their mortal minds
Bow down the horned god of the black underworld now I will make you my prize
Farther and farther and farther you go spiralling out of control
Feeling the heat from my fiery home burning your innocent soul
Demons in fiery chariots come to take you on this molten ride
You and the others the rest of the world experiencing genocide
Farther and farther and farther you go spiralling out of control
Is this your hell or the world that you live for now it may well be as one",Nefarious,1986
Hallows Eve,"Everyone is condemned to death time of execution unknown
Yet seek that which is within for the everyday fight in the horrorshow
Sword on your hip, cry on your lip charge upon beasts of your script
Misaligned verse I'm first to admit but life's stage knows no delay

Death the ultimate reality death the ultimate reason to live
No time no cordiality you've got to live because...
Nobody lives, lives forever I try not to slip on my sweat
Nobody lives, lives forever nobody lasts that long
I know when I reach my life's sum the addition will probably be wrong
That's okay I've made my mark pissed in public at least in the dark
When pissing in public one remembers traditions are passed on down the line
As a chamber pot is passed to your neighbor it's level grows higher every time

Do you remember the times that you thrashed do you remember it was suicide
Like healing leeches we drew blood to exorcise your inhibitions
You'll reach the figure down the line who gives you the final wink
Now the pages seem to rhyme as you forgive and wash in his sink
I don't know if that is it or if we choose our sides
But heads have drowned in oceans of fear when there were only peaceful tides",Nobody Lives Forever,1986
Hallows Eve,"Death is drawing closer I'm fighting for my life
I know not how to stop it live through this pain and strife
Awakened in the nighttime I'm fighting for my life
Death is drawing nearer I'll soon be cold as ice
No longer do I trifle bones growing too old
Death longing to reach and grasp my unrelenting soul
When I'm lying at my rest they'll look upon my face
Cry their tears of dreadful mourn in their weakened daily pace

Remember me, hear my plea time's drawing nigh for me to die
Remember me, hear my plea take from this heart the bitter part
The world they will destroy me or put me in the ground
Stand around my grave site with their heads all hanging down
When I'm lying at my rest they'll look upon my face
Cry their tears of dreadful mourn in their weakened daily pace
Staring at the ceiling the tubes glow in the dark
Fearless thoughts invade my head to tear my mind apart
Trapped within this feeling I feel it deep inside
Knock of death upon my door and I've no will to hide

Take from me my very soul with wretched mourning death
Take mine eyes for I have seen the hell in which we live
Take now from one man on earth who loved this life so much
Take away everything for it's all cold to the touch
Remember me, hear my plea soon the darkness I will see
Remember me, hear my plea for now another...",Plea of the Aged,1986

Our great monument to nothing
This glory, this sweat, this play

For every man stands a ghost
For every ghost stands a star
For every star stands a thought
And these accumulate somewhere

If God is the personification
Of the total of man's thought
Then I must be the reflection
Of all you have fought

This era, this music, this scene
Our great monument to nothing
This glory, this sweat, this play
Makes no difference what we say

Look into a place that you dare not look
You'll find me staring back at you
A perfect reflection, your mirror

In fair Verona, where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
And the continuance of their parents' rage
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend

Money hungry, prideful country

Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies

Back to the day when I was falling in love

Of nuclear bombs and power stations,

Unearth us yet...

A quick glimpse of the future warfare
Hidden under ground at Porton Down;

They got the virus and a microgram's enough 
To do in a continent.

It proceeds to Hiroshima.

On collision course.

I just want to be alone,
Unpick the stitches of time
In London
In the no-go zone.
I've been kicking around like a dog,
Lost myself in the blank mass of fog,
It's some kind of service.
All humanity's fall-out is there,
Slumped in doorways
And mouthing cold air -
I have heard this.
Fogwalking, fogwalking.
Since the curfew
The streets are half-dead,
All the good folk asleep in their beds,
It's so easy to go off the rails
When the fog spores
Are breeding inside by head.
Fogwalking: there's a presence that I sense
Fogwalking: the neck muscles tense
Fogwalking: it's right here inside me,
Try to find a defense - oh, no.

Als mich dieser Lichtstrahl traf

Hielt fest die Unschuld in der Hand
Bis wir die ersten Schritte wagten
In ein fremdes Land

Die Engel sprechen ein Gedicht
Alte Liebe rostet nicht
Die Sonne zeigt mir ihr Gesicht
Alte Liebe rostet nicht

Tiefe Narben langsam heilen
Gedanken noch sehr lang verweilen
Bis der Frühling lachend spricht
Alte liebe rostet nicht!

Als der Docht der achten Kerze
Wie ein Baum im Sturm zerbrach
Erlosch im Haus die letzte Glut
Legte sich Asche wie ein grauer Schleier übers Dach

Seitdem probierte ich genügend
Verbotene Früchte laut und still
Doch was nützen tausend Messer
Wenn man eine Gabel will

Ungeachtet der Gezeiten
Die hart am Denkmal nagen
Werden Herzen auch nach Jahren
Mühelos im Gleichschritt schlagen

Und will ich einmal glücklich werden
Muss eine von den Beiden sterben

The mighty men are all beaten down, their kings are fallen in the ways,
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.

Turn around,
Go back down,
Back the way you came,
Terror is on every side, lo our leaders are dismayed.

For theose who place their faith in fire, their faith in fire shall be
Repayed,

Turn around,

Go back down,
Back the way you came,
And shout a warning unto the nation that the sword of God is raised.
Yes, Babylon, that mighty city, rich in treasures, wide in fame,

Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
The meek shall cause your tower to fall, make a new pyre of flame,
Oh you who dwell on many waters, rich in treasures, wide in fame.
You bow unto your God of gold, your pride of might shall be a shame,

For only God can lead His people back unto the Earth again.
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.

Hamilton Leithauser,"My ginger voice was raw with smoke
They hid their smiles when I stood and spoke
Some sunny lawn, some Saturday
A face was flushed when I went to sing

Wild Mountain Thyme
But I was crying before the second line
The strawberry stripes across my ruddy cheeks got em giggling
My eyes are red and wild and white
As I choked up over another line
For years and year I disappeared
Tonight I'm here and I'm giving my best
It's all I have
The grandkids laugh
My linen vest is yellow stained
And my teeth are chipped, my beard is gray
Your mother left, she's not impressed
The wedding guests are starting to get restless
And I think I have worn out my welcome

But I swear I caught you smile
From the corner of my eye
When they threw me off the stage
Oh I know I saw you smiling
I swear I saw you smiling

They carried me away
Through the center of the crowd
On the corner of my eye
I swear I saw you smiling
You'll always be my darling, sweetheart",The Bride's Dad,2016
Hamilton Leithauser,"The scotch bonnet shells
From your bedside drawer
I snatched them myself
Off the ocean floor
Are strung around your neck
On a white boot lace
You'd wear them like that
Back when we used to date

If the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?

If the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?

'Cause I'm the one
Who rattles all
Your windows
And your doors
Howling in the night
Beyond your walls
Beneath your floors

At dawn I retire
With my palms on the glass
I stroll through the arcade
With the happy rats
And my hat fell in the river
And a Portuguese girl swooned
""You're as a free as the water
But it's harder to love""

So if the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?

Hamilton Leithauser,"I thought I heard the angel's lure
When I was on the chapel floor

No need to wander around
I live in a nameless town
In a black out

Paraded out in one proud line
I say they all just lost their minds

Midnight where we used to dance
Underneath the ugly halogen lamps
Oh, it all went away so fast
In a black out

We’ll wait for the year
When the tide comes
Rolling over the rails
From here 'til the end
Of the island
Washing away

I rent a room with all our stuff
When you come home I’d lift you up
And there’s only the two of us

Of a speeding yellow cab
Throw a kiss goodbye to all of that",In a Black Out,2016

Oooh she's my lady
The solitary reason for my days

And sometimes when my burdens just seem too overbearing
The girl turns my tears with a single sigh
She taught me loving
And through love we both learned sharing
Right now she's every, every reason why

Ooooh she is my lady

I don't have to worry cause she's my lady
OOoooo
She is my lady
And the witness goes
The wonder of her ways
Ooo
I'm so thankful
She is my lady
Yes she is

Read between the lines
You know I tried,
Oh, yes, I tried, whatÂ´s wrong

And think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday

DonÂ´t leave me with the sorrow
'Cause I have to live today

Every morning I awake
To see the newborn day
To carry on the flame
Until the end of time

And think about tomorrow
But you have to live today

And pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
DonÂ´t you know tomorrow never comes

Marching off to war, the crusade has just begun
Fighting for the right to live under the sun

Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
This magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong

Like an arrow we strike - stronger than all
Heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might - stronger than all
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves and our lives

Warriors of the faith, to no living soul we kneel
Born into the fold, the templars are for real

Shooting through the air at full speed
Like an arrow of might - stronger than all
In the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs

The past and the present unites in us all, we stand up for our beliefs
The way of the templars is here once again, forever they will be free

But everyone says different things

They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

[Chorus:]
I want out, to live my life alone
I want out, leave me be
I want out, to do things on my own
I want out, to live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B	
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'Cause I decide the way things gonna be

Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night and now you're gone, I'm left here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through

You were the wind beneath my wings, taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings, how could this ever die

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever,
And I always will be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life, taught me to be free
Now I'm a stranger in your eyes, walls are closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are the one
And you always will be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn,
But after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are the one

Hampenberg,"[Chorus: Repeat 2X] 
I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...
No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montiego Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...

[Chorus] 

Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'ma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't want to lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that why'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

[Chorus:]  

This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the forty five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my twenty-inch rims...
Moolah why'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...

Hampton Hawes,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

Hampton Hawes,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Hampton Hawes,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1969
Hampton Hawes,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1969
Hampton Hawes,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1973
Hampton Hawes,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on

I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

And so let us part

Hampton Hawes,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Hampton Hawes,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky

But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1956
Hampton Hawes Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1956
Hampton Hawes Trio,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you

And mail it right away

Hampton Turner,"I was sittin' on a creek bank, bored out of my mind
Can't stand away a day, a week, a month of my whole life
And then it hit me like a ten pound catfish upside my head
Nothing's worth doing if I'm doing it all by myself

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track
This hanging solo is getting so old to me
Gonna find me a baby and make a couple babies and sing in harmony

We'll sing na na na, na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na na

I was sitting on my front porch when she came walking by
She was looking for a helping hand, a man to change a tire
We hit it off and we talked forever and I bought that girl a ring
Then quicker than a Richard Petty pit stop, I got down on one knee and said

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track
This hanging solo is getting so old to me
Yeah I found you baby, let's make a few babies and sing in harmony, yeah

Well now me and my baby are on baby number three
When we all get warmed up, you oughta hear us sing

Na na na, na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na na

I needed to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I needed to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track
That hanging solo got so old to me
Yeah I found me a baby, we made a few babies and we sang in harmony
Hey I found me a baby, we made a few babies and you oughta hear us sing

We go na na na, na na na

T'es dans un endroit tu vois des choses c'est comme si tu revivais la même scène
C'est déjà vu
Mais moi ce monde parfois il m'ennuie tellement que j'ai l'impression que j'l'ai déjà vu

C'est ça la vie
Chérie chérie quand un gars te siffle sauvagement dans la rue
Excuse-moi par hasard on s'est pas déjà vu
Rajoute bah si tu veux pourquoi tu nous allumes
C'est du déjà vu
Par contre si c'est un beau gosse belle sape bien propre
Basket blanche marchant seul sans pote s'emporte dit
Excusez-moi mademoiselle par hasard ton père ne serait pas Ben Laden
Parce que t'es une bombe t'as bloqué ma montre déréglé mon compte
J'ai même pas regardé tes fesses depuis 30 secondes
J'ai pas besoin de ton numéro juste du hasard pour qu'on se rencontre

C'est ça la vie

Dans la boite magique du sexe après minuit
Des reportages truqués dans les infos de midi
Une mauvais pub pour la jeunesse qui vit ici
C'est du déjà vu
Un précident kainry qui parle pas de guerre à ses sénateurs
C'est mon tour de scénariser sur la scène internationale
Si Messieurs et mesdames c'est Serigne je rappe pour le Sénégal
C'est anormal de céder à ce point à ce côté animal
Mr Bush a décidé de dire c'est le bien contre le mal
C'est du jamais vu ça tient du domaine du paranormal
Des conneries pareilles ces frères de Raël ils ont la palme ont la palme

Mc ton flow ton style tes rimes faciles
Mc tu parles que d'argent et que de cul
C'est du déjà vu
Par contre un Mc qui vient pas que pour graille pas que pour sa dalle
Qui débite sur tout beat capable de foutre un putain de z'beule
Un Mc juste qui fait les choses doucement et que la concurrence vexée subit des attouchements
Sur la distance tient la route tout le temps touche au coeur souvent
Et que ses disques vendent
Trop de rimes, phrase lourde, texte pointu

Frérot un monde riche inégal injuste pour la femme
Fait de drames et de guerres d'esclavage c'est l'enfer
C'est la terre, c'est la merde, on s'aime pas on s'entre-tue
C'est du déjà vu
Un condé qui tag, un manchot qui braque
Une grand-mère qui break la coupe du monde en Afrique
L'annulation de la dette Le pen aux Epinettes
La politique honnête
C'est du jamais vu
Un curé pédophile, un scarla qui se défile
Des breakeurs qui se défient en fracassant leur style
Des jeunes qui fument à l'excès, une kaïra qui pleure au procès

Hamza Yusuf,"The signs that have occurred and continue to intensify
One of them that Prophet Muhammad
Peace be upon him said that, that one of the signs would be
That intoxicants would be widely used

So you can see this happening in the Muslim world and
Just intensifying from quite time some ago

Another sign would be nakedness
That people would begin to remove their clothes
And he said until it would get to the point where
People would actually walk around in the marketplaces in shorts
With their thighs fully exposed

Um, he said also that people would have sexual intercourse
In front of other people, was a sign of the end of times
Another one would be speed in travel
He said great distances would be traversed in very short times
And he said people would hop between the clouds and the earth

Al-kahir sudjena khal wee was sunnah

And he said musical instruments would be everywhere
And he said that people would dance with instruments on their head
Which some have interpreted as headphones
And they would spend the whole night dancing like that
And you would see singing with women traveling

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it

We ran from home to seek a place where our bodies would never grow.
Dreamer, child, be cautious of this world!
She has an appetite for boys and girls and she’s hungry for your soul.

Little boys with dreams of paper planes were never meant to scrape the sky!
Keep your feet on the ground kid, only birds were meant to fly.
Keep your head from the clouds kid, keep your wings,
Always keep them by your side.

Before you fly, you’ll fall,
Before you walk, you’ll crawl….

You’ve no need to stitch your shadow to your heels,
No, not this time.

Son you’ll walk with no whisper, no sound,
Only the feet of the heavy hearted are held to the ground.
You’ve no need to draw the curtains son, throw them wide.
Cross the borders between the never and the night.
Find the twinkle in your smile, chase it on ‘til morning,
Past the second star to the right.

We’ll be the smoke curling on the still.
The airship captains; we wait for sun to brush the hills.

Son, I share your windward dreams,
To soar from this little town of shacked up windows and swinging doors!
The rafters creak and the floorboards groan
While the shadows dance to the tapping of my toes.

There’s nothing left for us but altitude,
We’ll be the kings of the air.

You touch me at the spot
Ooh boy, you got me high (that's right)
And when you're loving me down, i never want you to stop

Hurt MCs ride the pine and get paid, no nevermind
One time as I sew it up like Dr. Frankenstein
Chickens ride the pony cause the rhyme flow genuine
As I do it like that, do it like this
Shorty watch your step or you might get Rocked like Chris
Are you feelin this? You dig the way it's going down?
Now we back in town watch all the chickens crowd around
Niggas try to duplicate my flow but it's difficult
Like a game of Yahtzee
Chickens stress me out like paparazzi
As I flip a flow you desire
Dattie blaze those trees and let's start this forest fire
My rhymes carry like the weight on Barry
Stack cheddar like Combs and buy homes like Larry
I be smoother than Tal, Sharp-ton like Al
When you ballin everybody want to be your pal
No dilly-dally, baggin up the shorter alley
Bouncin in German cars, still playin shot-ball

Watch the green van cause inside's the dicks
The prayer beads bleeds from the crucifix
Went tight comin out boy I be down in six
Or when the sun go down, or when it's round in the BX

Cats on the concourse, still holdin dx (?)
Bums on the street often ask me for change
What's change when I'm tryin to save up for the Range?
I want the whole world and my old back
Change that -- I want half the world, and my old 
You can play the hell out, like those that came before ya
Your style is butt, similar to a cobra
That's your pimp strut
But what you foes is really doin
Is leaving your empire in ruins
I'm the problem solver
I got the brand new revolver
But I got a new album too
I want to be here for that money and the rest of my crew
Y'all know it's true-- a nigga like me is due

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio

Now you know I gots to come back strong
See I been doing this too goddamned long
For me to ever try to come back wrong
Check my pockets and my empty light just came on
Don't wanna do wrong so I think I'm best to make this song
Undeniably satisfiably master microphone mutilator
None greater, ain't no Automator
Grand Puba and Dattie, riding shotty in the Mazarati
As we come and blaze you with this body

[Sadat]
Corner poets get smacked and hit, savagely bit
I go git and then you out of it, permission to quit
I mean right, I keep the green light specials
Half price a slice, you blink twice
I done picked up the dice
I'm that nice, Dattie X the party-starter
Number one heart-ripper-aparter
More vice and than Las Vegas, Nevada
I try harder every day

Go to the burning bush
Happy would ease your troubled mind
How do the fade just stay behind?

I know you better than you think I do
Don't worry this is why I fell in love with you
The man in the looking glass
Is looking back at you at last

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide

If happy times are too few and far between
It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
So disappear, vanish if you wish
Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go

May not be true to see that you would return one day
But in your present state you may as well not be here at all
You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall

Regardless of what your friends say
They're all disable
Striken from the record and deemed indimissable
And this long arm of the law grabs a mightier
Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
The sentence of this live litigator
Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim
What they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as in' with lies will
I brew skill with free fills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

Baby I don't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is

Workin for peanuts amongst jelly MC's, really ain't my steez

But you wasn't hey
Served you're purpose dog
At the end of the day
Is it worth it all
Immersed in all the worth the world got to offer
But perpetrating proper like nothing can stop ya
Can't even trust my doctor she in it for profit
And everybody looking for some kind of profit
Situation mad toxic my man got hit
'Cause the bird he was with wouldn't stop squawking
She juggling five cats and they all lost in
The illusion of love that she used for profit
The usual topic chickens and benjamins
You supposed to be my kin Mexican or Asian European or Korean or Jamaican
Makes no difference
Our existence is still shared between us in essence

Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

Show some love for your brothers and sisters
Show some love for the whole wide world
Show some love for your enemies and frenemies
Show some love for the rejects on the street
Show some love for the whole wide world

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

If the world is bad refer to your dad
And his before four score what's the reason he saw for
Karma is real part of the deal when's how you started the deal
'Cause everything is 360
It will start the cartwheel
And snowballs so don't forget now cause I told y'all
Dead the 'cause all it do is hold y'all captive
All in the world you're trapped in
Relaxing you can't feel what's happening
I deal with facts man
I was at the crossroads dealing with lost souls that couldn't cross though
Lost hope off dope
Out to jostle
Any unweary traveler that would fall the talk show
It's foul how they play it
But you can't stray to show love take
Courage and strength and realize we ain't sure as we think you know

The world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

'Cause the world's gone crazy
Even though love no more
Show love, show love, show show love
Show love, show love, show love

It's a thrill to me that you niggas want to kill me
I think you all know this saga
They mad cause they wish they had the shit that I had
I'm fucking there babies moma
My soldiers salute with their guns high
Aim and they'll shoot you with one try
I never understood why, niggas snitch and bitches lie
How a motherfucker gonna testify
When he's doing the same shit that I'm doing?
Yap to the feds for a little bit of bread
Now The whole fucking game is ruined
A lot of these niggas are two faced
They need to use glue for they tooth paste
They better strap up or get their boots laced
Or get victim of a 44 shell case
Your bitch said she like the way my dick taste
Now the hoe back up in your face
To the rules of the game you're a disgrace
Never trust no bitch in the first place
Me and Big Sco came to blast these hoes'
Who can't keep shit on the hush
When we come, guns bust
Ruckus hit the dust, it's only us

These niggas want drama?
Who the fuck these busta testing
Bout to teach em a lesson, when I get to blesson

No question let me make one suggestion
Don't fuck around with a nigga that you can't fuck with
Cause I buck quick what's wrong dog?
You mad at me cause your bitch suck dick
Just duck quick cause when I let that thing off
When I break it off ring it off it's over with
Busting nuts I'm all over the shoulder shit
You can't fuck with a nigga y'all know this shit is on
Some popo shit but when it comes to me I don't know no shit
You got to go bitch gotta find a big ditch for a bitch snitch
Hit the nigga with 6 in the mix
Ima fix the mother fucker cause he a big bitch
Swiftly hit the nigga with the fifty caliber
Challenger, I'm a damage ya, you a amateur
I got stamina, kill a nigga put it on camera
Fuck around I'll have to handle ya, dismantle ya, ha
This what I do to a enemy
Split a motherfuckers head like Kennedy
Fuck y'all, don't you know its ten of me
So don't pretend to be no friend to me

Simply I bust and the ones I can't touch
Well put it like this, them bitches get fucked, my dick get sucked

Won't you tell me where my love can be?

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Rested in their bunkers 
Taken kind of trash 
Inside their hearts

No home no food no sex 
Wrestling for hours

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Hank Ballard,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

And Cuban rum
And towels from

When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Hank Crawford,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song,1972

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan

Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1997
Hank Crawford,"When I'm away from you, boy
All I seem to do is cry
And then when I see you, boy

The way I love and need you

I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
Real soon, can you make it real soon?

When I think about you, girl
Chills run up and down my spine
And if my wish would come true, girl
I'd be with you all the time

For the right, day and night I'm gonna miss you
All my lonely heart seems to do

I hope that we can be together soon
(Maybe tomorrow)
I hope that we can be together soon

I feel that we can be together soon
But will you make it real soon?

Can you make it real soon?

Every day my love grows stronger

Hank Crawford,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you

Are the stars out tonight

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Were never to be

In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance On Love,1955
