Hallelujah, hallelujah
We're here to pull ya
Back in to do it all the same

David Phelps,"O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night!,2008
David Phelps,"Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There’s always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it’s hard at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe
I’ll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You’re in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There’s vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don’t make no difference
Escaping one last time
It’s easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh, the glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You’re in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You’re in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

David Phelps,"Nessun dorma, nessun dorma
Tu pure, o, Principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle
Che fremono d'amore
E di speranza

Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun sapra
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo diro
Quando la luce splendera

Ed il mio bacio sciogliera il silenzio
Che ti fa mia

Il nome suo nessun sapra
E noi dovrem, ahime, morir

Tramontate, stelle
All'alba vincero
Vincero, vincero

David Phelps,"Sometimes when I'm weary
All I have for strength is You
And sometimes when I am cold
All I have to keep me warm is You

So I close my eyes
And fold my hand
And You're right there
To be my friend

Your love
Is just a prayer away
And Your love is all I need
To face another day

Sometimes when I'm lonely
All I have for company is You
Sometimes when I cry
All I have to comfort me is You

So I close my eyes
And bend my knees
And call on You
To rescue me

Your love
Is just a prayer away
And Your love is all I need
To face another day

And when someone takes a moment
Just to show they care
Oh, I know You are reaching out
To help me from there

Your love
Is just a prayer away
Your love is all I need
To face another day

Oh, all I need
To face another day
Yeah

David Phelps,"Deep within the heart has always known that there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul of life
The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it

And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme

And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing, let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption

David Phelps,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.

All the demons, all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory

Tonight there's calling strangers, hear them crying in defeat.

Well, she rode some horse's ride

Don't melt the lady's heart,

Will bring back the old times,
Maybe the old lines will sound new.
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder,
Maybe old feelings will some through
Maybe we'll start to cry,
And wonder why, we ever walked away

Will bring back the old times
And make her want to stay, oh oh

Seeing her face light up
When I come home.
Been to many hours I've waited
Staring at the phone

Sweet old songs I'm counting on you
Bring her back to me

And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar
A rockstar
Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda
Yes! Number one contender
Yes! Lyrical skunk never heard of my scent
I used to listen to Call Fm!
Black market...
Couple a years later
Lyrical sniper
I was a raver
Me and my man got briefing everywhere
Goin' on horrid
Heartless bears we are so solid
To be a MC ouh it was so funny
After years and determination
I'm part of a world known organization
Undefeated no other teaming
...
And no formation
Me and my mate is a Jesus
I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up
...
I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind
That man there was leaving away
...
That's what I was back in the day
But I still represent the sounds of the UK
Little bit of dubstep little bit of grime
...

Doing this for awesome crew
One for the a track and dynamite boo
I don't wanna tell them what to do
They'll deal with a nasty crew

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

David Ruffin,"You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Money love or power
When you want to have the number one first run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them

You ought to know better than that
The more that you buy the less you get back
It's a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme

The compulsion to count the percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
And all the good times suffer
Though you know it's only jealousy
You can't help but be
Haunted by your passion

Don't you know it's a matter of fact
The more that you take the less you give back
Just a taste of possession obsession
Brings a case of possession obsession

The distant moanin' of a train

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

You want my heart, you got to work
And show me that you'd ride it there for me
I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do
You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you

Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that
Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at
I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't play by the rules

But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around

It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart breaker
But a great love maker, all in a sheet

She won’t let,
She wrecking my place like Tasmanian devil
I’m giving the base, she giving the treble
And we turn it up, to the next level
I told her we can do it when the sun’s up
Or we can get it in when the sun’s down
Or maybe we can meet halfway

David Ryan Harris,"Well they're moving to St. Augustine
That's where the cool folks go
Packing up those bibles man.
Nothing for them here they know.
Moving further south so spread some peace and love,
Ask them why they're going and they'll say,

[Chorus]
A voice came from above.
It said ""See that nothing works like change.
Change is good for you
See the world. See what you can do.
There's a lot you're gonna have to answer for out there
See the world""

Well, that old man's ass is rotting in his favorite rocking chair
Hell and high water drop by, and they always find him there.
See the girl standing on the pier, she's going to take the last thing out.
Inside her pretty head she seems to hear her conscious shout.

I found a genie on my front porch and I'm gonna use him
To get next to you.
I won't wish for diamonds, long life, or money:
Just for a moment alone with you honey.
I'm trying to use him to put a hex on you.

[Chorus]
I've got a feeling I'm wasting my wishes
I've got a feeling you'll never be true
I've got a feeling your mountains too high
Your river is too wide
I've got a feeling you've got a genie too,
And your genie is stronger than mine.

You're mine all mine, you're my destiny.
I'll have my genie use his trickery to tempt and entice
Oh, to bring me next to you.
Mystical sorcerer taste my longing, sate my appetite.
I'm trying to use him to put a hex on you.

Headed out of this town.
You seem to bring dear heaven so close I almost can grab it
And head on out of this town.

[Chorus]
If I had a dime for every time
I thought of you, I would be through.
Scraping for crumbs behind the sun.
You would be mine if I had a dime.

You look at me and I put my faith in something the eye can't see
Yes, I believe.
Without a sign, lets steal away each tempting charm
To please, entice or appease.

You'd no longer be above me on the high road that I can't get to.
Can't you feel me at the gateway? Let me come through.

David Ryan Harris,"Bow down! Hail the king karma! Watch me work.
Bow down! Hail the king karma. Watch me work
Sometimes I am concerned that the floor might
Collapse beneath my weight, because I am so heavy.

Sometimes I worry that I just might drown those
Who wish to stand with me because I get so deep.
And there are days when I could make light-headed pawns
Of men who follow because I get so high.

A twist of fate, a stroke of luck,
Divine intervention pale sickly in my light.
What does your life owe to king karma?
Bow down! Hail the king karma! Watch me work.

Sometimes I wonder why you people try
To hide your actions from me because I see it all.
What goes around comes around.
What goes up most come down.

Come now, children. Haven't you been warned?
Sometimes I feel like Santa bringing love
To those who do deserve and hell to those who don't.
Other times I may play the piper
Without mercy or comparison, only scorn.
What does your life owe to king karma?

Your path must soon go through king karma.
Watch out
What does your life owe to king karma?
Your path must soon go through king karma.

Trade in your halo
For a soft show.
Down little angel. Who has cut your strings?
Fear the light of the sun.
Didn't they warn you?

What held me, now floats above.
Fall from grace, no longer loved.
My lover,
Your branches too.

We've so much in common, me and the leaves.
How can a dancer dance if you don't sing?
Trade in all that was sunshine for a shady view.
I never knew silence could be so deafening.
All that used to surround
Twinkles above you.

We could speak the twisted speak of love
(no voice or sound)

Nothing more to say.

If she were the blue sky and I was a sparrow
And I'd bathe within the folds of her dress
She'd open and invite, cradle me in flight,
Soak me in daylight, get me to fly right
Hold me and caress.

There's no need for me to tell you how fine you are.
There's no need for me to mention how you outshine the stars

The sandman is on his midnight creep.

And my worries run like the sunshine runs from the night.

Two suns in a closed jar.
Liquefy the viper for the show.
Cut the cord and breathe deep.
Racing in a dead sleep.

Sympathize in silence for the crow.

Swear to be a prophet.
Steal the jewel and drop it.
Lay another crack out in the road.
Happenstance and visions, stupid superstitions.
Sympathize in silence for the crow.

[Chorus]
You lose the battle when
You start believing in everything you read
It's just like Stevie said.
A cosmic free for all with caps and crystal balls
When you believe in things like the archetype in wings.

The humble and meager,
The perpetual griever,
Sing 'em to sleep, but the crow just gets no sympathy.

The humble and meek,
The tired and the weak,
Sing 'em to sleep, but the crow just gets no sympathy.

King underachiever
Half an unbeliever.
King the sleeping serpent down and go
Hide out in the open, cowering but hoping.
Sympathize and side for the crow.

David Ryan Harris,"Thought I'd make the cloudy sunny
But it seems my lover hates sunlight.
Went to see her in the morning
But it seems she's only home at night.
Bought a wagon full of roses
And my lover says she hates the smell.
Most folks say that I should give up
But I think its too early to tell.

[Chorus:]
So I try to second guess her
Hoping she'll profess her undying love and loyalty.
Continue to pursue her
Hoping to renew her sense in faith in guys like me
That woman is bound to see me
One day she'll believe me
You'd think I was Houdini 
With these tricks up my sleeve (2X)

So I brought her doves from Eden
And she says the feathers makes her sneeze
Suffice to say I'll never give up
Even though this woman's hard to please
By now I could be an artist
I spend so much time at the drawing board
Most folks say I should give up
But I kind of dig being ignored

Making her mine",Tricks Up My Sleeve,1997
David Ryan Harris,"Son what you don’t understand
My words might never explain
So I am hoping that time will
Things may not go as you planned
Dark clouds might bring you pain
But I will be in your heart still, telling you

“Don’t look down, don’t feast your eyes on things that are on the ground
And if it gets hard to focus
When you’re traveling almost at the speed of sound
Feeling nowhere bound, remember what I told you
And don’t you dare look down

Don’t look down, no

No father wants his son
To repeat the wrongs his daddy’s done
I want you to get it right child
I won’t always be here for you
So to yourself always be true
And if you get lost, use your inner light child, shine it and

Don’t look down
Don’t feast your eyes on things that are on the ground
And if it gets hard to focus
When you’re traveling almost at the speed of sound
Feeling nowhere bound

Almost out of control, burn rubber and not your soul
Because something lives within
That you can count on, there is no hand to hold
When the world seems dark and cold

Remember what I told you
And don’t you dare look down

Don’t you dare look down
Don’t look down
When you’re traveling almost at the speed of sound
Don’t you dare look down

I'm begging you don't go away
We should be getting better
Though we are somewhere near the edge

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

So it's the laughter we will remember

If it ain't a push forward its a slow down
It's kind of ironic that I slow down,
It's best that I go now rather than later
Before you claim I'm too busy chasing that paper -it's true talk
And to say its over there ain't no good words,
I don't think anybody breaks up on good terms
So I'ma hit the club (yep)
Get my mingle on (yep) get my single on and throw it in a single song- Chyeaah.

Hungry but I don't wanna have my cake and eat it too
And it's not that I ain't feelin you

I get these blues most every night,

David Sanborn,"One life, and you're on your own, and you don't ever find a way back home
One road and you travel alone, you keep on even when your hope is gone

And nothin's gonna make you have a change of heart.

Change of heart. 
Change of heart.
Change of heart. 
Change of heart.

A worried mind, and a heart full of pain, you drag it around just like a ball and chain
It doesn't matter where you go, there's no runnin' away from everything you know
The writing's on the wall, but still you won't surrender
You won't give up, you won't make a start
And nothin's gonna make you have a change of heart.

David Sanborn,"Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread

I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the dark side before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppin' em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about
Real niggas we won't have a reason to kill niggas, heal niggas
My plane it runs so deep I'm a share it with why'all
While my own niggas is trying to cut throat while I'm tryin' to ball

Bajando la calle luna
Cuando la tarde se va

Con un rosario en la mano
Recorre el viejo San Juan
Pidiendo a Dios por su amado

Se le ve tirando besos al aire
Como si hablara con alguien
Pero a su lado no hay nadie

Sofia, el amor de Sofia
Va a volver algun dia
Va a volver algun dia

Lo se, Sofia enloquecio
Cunado su mejor amiga
La traiciono y se marcho
Con el amor de su vida

Sobre su pelo marron
Aun lleva el velo de novia
Alla en el viejo San Juan
Todos conocen su historia

Del amor haciendo alarde
Pero a su lado no hay nadie

We would meet on that shore in the
Sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true,
Some just passed away
And some of the stayed behind
Inside the Sad Cafe.

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by,
And wonder at the powers that be.
I don't know why fortune smiles on some
And lets the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly,
If they ever change at all
There's no use in asking why,
It just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby
Inside the Sad Cafe.
Why don't you meet me at midnight baby,

Dreaming of a song

Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

On his horse (a pretty good horse)
Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater

Hang up your stockin' on Christmas Eve

Listen to me through the year

With a sleigh of reindeer too
And just before you settle down
You better be sure that you

David Seville,"Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go!
Hi, boys, here I go!

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more!

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon outside was shining on the snow
When the look will right on the ground below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More faster than eagles the reindeer came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;

""Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His cute little mouth was just like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;

He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.""",The Night Before Christmas,2003

David Seville,"When the work begins to pile up,
And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,
Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work.

David Seville & The Chipmunks,"Out in Arizona where the bad men are,
And the only friend to guide you is an Evening Star,
The roughest, toughest man by far
Is Ragtime Cowboy Joe.
Got his name from singing to the cows and sheep
Every night they say he sings the herd to sleep
In a basso rich and deep,
Crooning soft and low

How he sings raggy music to his cattle
As he swings back and forward in his saddle
On his horse (a pretty good horse)
Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater

How they run when they hear the feller's gun
Because the western folks all know:
He's a hifalootin' scootin', shootin'
Son-of-a-gun from Arizona
Ragtime cowboy (talk about your cowboy)
Ragtime cowboy Joe.

Dressed up ev'ry Sunday in his Sunday clothes
He beats it for the village where he always goes,
And ev'ry girl in town is Joe's
'Cause he's a ragtime bear;
When he starts a-spieling on the dance hall floor,
No one but a lunatic would start a war

Comfort me through all this madness.

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring.

Show me the cart and I'll throw it away

It looked like something in a magazine
To a blind man it's plain to see
That I need you and you need me

I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
When things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

Took me home to tell your dad
That you were the best girl I've ever had
I stayed for dinner, I couldn't refuse
I spilt the tea and I ate the news
Ah, you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
I can't move, it's hard to think
With cramp in my eyelids and I can't blink

We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way

On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away
It's time to move on or go down with the ship

David St. Romain,"I love you period

Back when I was goin' to school, I never learned a thing
All I did was daydream, a-waitin' for the bell to ring
I had a certain teacher, I always tried to impress her
When she stood up in the classroom, I would mentally undress her
Then one day I decided, that I would write a little letter
She said the spellin' was a masterpiece, the punctuation could be better
I understood what she was saying, I got the gist of her sentiment
She said I don't mean to be degrading, but here's the way that it shoulda
    went

[Chorus (2x):]
I love you period
Do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses

Right on up to high school, people said I was a writin' fool
All my letters became really great, with punctuation that was never late
But I was havin' trouble meetin' girls, I never knew the things to say
Soon I had 'em all overwhelmed, when they heard me talk this way, like this

[Chorus]",I Love You Period,2006
David Staller,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",1994
David Staller,"Mister Shylock was stingy
I was miserly too.
I was more selfish
And crabby than a shellfish.

What love can do!

I'd give all my possessions
For you
I've got five dollars
I'm in good conditions
And I've got ambition
That belongs to you.
Six shirts and collars
Debts beyond endurance
On my life insurance
That belongs to you!

I've got a heart
That must be spurtin'!

David Staller,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My lips could move and talk

David Staller,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1994
David Staller,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

David Staller,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother

But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

David Staller,"Do it the hard way and it's easy sailing
Do it the hard way and it's hard to loose
Only the soft way has a chance of failing
You have to choose

Now that you want me

David Staller,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me, sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again,1995
David Staller,"I don't know what day it is,
Or if it's dark out there;
Somehow that's just the way it is,
And I don't really care!

I go to this or that place,
I seem alive and well,
My head is just a hat place,
My breast an empty shell,
And I've a faded dream to sell.

All alone and all at sea,
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love,
Why is my heart so frail,
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart;
I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.
When there's no hand to hold my hand,
Life is a loveless tale,
Like a ship without a sail.

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.

David Steele,"There were two sisters of county Clair
Oh, the wind and rain
One was dark and the other was fair
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And they both had a love of the miller's son
Oh, the wind and rain
But he was fond of the fairer one
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

So she pushed her into the river to drown
Oh, the wind and rain
And watched her as she floated down
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And she floated till she came to the miller's pond
Oh, the wind and the rain
Dead on the water like a golden swan
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

As she came to rest on the riverside
Oh, the wind and the rain
And her bones were washed by the rolling tide
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And along the road came a fiddler fair
Oh, the wind and rain
And found her bones just a lying there, cried
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

So he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone

He a made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone, crying
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And he strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair

David Stein,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here

David Stephenson,"Truly, I didn't mean to hurt you so.
Hands down I'm a loser my friends told you so
Because when I drink I get drunk and when I'm drunk 
I get mad and when I'm mad I run away.

It's a curse a family curse I curse the day that I was born. 
I've runaway too many time I guess my sheep is shorn. 
You said to chose between the booze and you I picked the booze. 
You spread your wings, lightened your load, got a running start and flew away.

Julie, don't take your love, don't take your love downtown.

It's not that I haven't tried to get my shit together. 
I'm not the sharpest pencil in the box film at 11.

I took 13 steps off a 12 step pier lucky I was wearing sandles. 
There I go again rambling on.

I'm not begging you to come back I realize I've burned my bridges. 
I apologize for my wicked ways and hope to be forgiven. 
But you can choose to smear my name by hanging out and partying, 
Drinking beers with smokin' blokes but baby let me warn you.

Just stay out of downtown.

David Storrs,"Hey, boy!

Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When the Glove's on the wheels of steel he's reckless

This high-powered music is truly unique
As the Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
He moves like a madman as he spins his disc
He's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's reckless

Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's reckless

So listen very closely as the Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With the Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're reckless

So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E

Y yo la verdad no me encuentro pa' tanto
Me encuentro simpático, un poco maniático 
Quizá de este lado un poquito mejor

Pero ya te digo no sé lo que pasa 
Y todos los días me escriben mil cartas
Llaman a mi casa y luego no hablan 
Sólo se oyen risas, tengo que colgar

One word on which bemusedly to pour.

David Sylvian,"I'm waiting on the empty docks
Watching the ships come in
I'm waiting for the agony to stop
Oh, let the happiness in
I'm watching as the gulls all settle down
Upon the empty vessels
The faded whites of their wedding gowns
The songs of hopeless selflessness

The cold december sun
A cold that blisters
The hands of a working man
Wasted

I'm waiting on the empty docks
Watching the ships roll in
I'm longing for the agony to stop
Oh, let the happiness in

Oh, let the happiness in
Listen to the waves against the rocks
I don't know where they've been
I'm waiting for the skies to open up
And let the happiness in

Oh, let the happiness in
",Let the Happiness In,1993
David Sylvian,"Standing firm on this stony ground
The wind blows hard
Pulls these clothes around
I harbour all the same worries as most
The temptations to leave or to give up the ghost
I wrestle with an outlook on life
That shifts between darkness and shadowy light
I struggle with words for fear that they'll hear
But orpheus sleeps on his back still dead to the world

Sunlight falls, my wings open wide
There's a beauty here I cannot deny
And bottles that tumble and crash on the stairs
Are just so many people I knew never cared
Down below on the wreck of the ship
Are a stronghold of pleasures I couldn't regret
But the baggage is swallowed up by the tide
As orpheus keeps to his promise and stays by my side

Tell me, I've still a lot to learn
Understand, these fires never stop
Believe me, when this joke is tired of laughing
I will hear the promise of my orpheus sing

Sleepers sleep as we row the boat
Just you the weather and I gave up hope
But all of the hurdles that fell in our laps
Were fuel for the fire and straw for our backs
Still the voices have stories to tell
Of the power struggles in heaven and hell
But we feel secure against such mighty dreams
As orpheus sings of the promise tomorrow may bring

Tell me, I've still a lot to learn
Understand, these fires never stop
Please believe, when this joke is tired of laughing
I will hear the promise of my orpheus sing",Orpheus,1993
David Sylvian,"You were someone to believe in
A place for hope in a changing world
Feeling every moment
Every one of the years spent in your arms

After a lifetime of living
These soiled hands show no life at all
Working at all hours
Never facing the fears here in my heart

Grieving for the loss of heaven
Weeping for the loss of heaven
By the wailing wall

You were someone to believe in
Giving life where there was a will to learn
But it's the nature of living
To count only the years left in your heart
",Weathered Wall,1993
David Sylvian,"Cold morning
Start of another day
Sleeping through the epilogue
Waking to the sound of rain

Driven to the crossroads
Where value's meaningless
What did you do to my faith
In justice, hope and happiness

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

Take my fire
Take my food and water
Forget about those promises
Of social good and social order

Lassoed by the cowboys
Tied down and it shows
I'm roping in those bad dreams
And selling off my working clothes

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

Gonna take a course of action
To restore my sight
'Til the heart of motivation
Is filled with a golden light

They're hiding in the treetops
Tugging at my coat
Power lines are falling down
And burning in the undergrowth

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

As the river runs, tumbles and turns
You know you shouldn't stay
Play the game again
It could be different this time
You may win

Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Lying down

Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Lying down

I'm moving to the house of love
Moving to the house of love
I'm moving to the house of love
Moving, I'm moving, I'm moving
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving
I'm moving to the house of love

Caught in moments
The night is starless
And stands below
And I need you by my side
Baby, baby
I love you so
Don`t leave me alone in this hollow
When brightness falls
Who`ll come running?
When brightness falls
Who`ll come running in?
Saved by silence
Save by noise
Save by lightning
Saved by joy
Building on emptiness
And all you broken hearted people

And who can believe in tomorrow?

Who`ll come running?

Who`ll come running in?

Raids the fridge and eats the lot
No room for silence, pause of thought

They placed a barrel at his head
Raging blind and rising
Cursed by saints and all the rest
He can`t stand up for trying
Shot through with anger and desire
A mouth to feed, a room for hire
He drinks 'goodbyes', the bottle dry
Brutalised but smiling
Causing casualties by the hour
Outweighed by stars
And Firepower
Causing casualties by the hour
Waylayed by stars

On the borderline of truth

I see no place I've loved

To find the road

To the place that I have spoken
Come lead me through the darkness
To the light that I long to see again

But sleep beside her

It passes us over

He wouldn't speak or show you he was happy
Though you'd meet him with your eyes
There was a wall that always stood between you
He'd shut himself outside

And the love that he engendered
Would never be enough
For him to feel alive
Warm and tender
He'd shut himself outside

But dug in deep and fighting

With so much self in his writing

Who is moving back in time
It's a physical ascension
You can watch him as he climbs

The farmer's wives are at their windows
They've seen him wind his way for hours
They tell the kids to lower their voices
And pretend that they are out

There's a man down in the valley
Trying to stop time in its tracks
His boots lie heavy on the grasses
But it keeps on pushing back

And his wife she was a painter
But now she stains the altar black
He's out bird watching on the islands
And she wishes he'd come back

The lungs won't full, the heart won't start

To lighten the load

Following the tire tracks
Of the truck sanding the road

Running through the girl's body
There had to be drugs
And they too had a name
And the adrenalin rush
Had left her exhausted
When under the blue sky

And there is no maker
Just an exhaustible indifference

Of the trucks as they rolled on
Out on Highway 95

Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean 
You know what I mean

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

So insecure you see

And this is one scene

So take off that unbecoming frown
What about me - well
I´ll find someone
That´s not going cheap in the sales

A nice little housewife
Who´ll give me a steady life
And won´t keep going off the rails
Take your hands off me

See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold
 
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold

He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band",Leader of the Band,2002

We may still get by
We may still get by",F Train,1999
David Usher,"Heaven haunts me; kill for a cigarette
Heaven is all that I got

My god left me without one word of warning
My god left me waiting is all that I got

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger, crashing down
All my life, I've seen your babies
Crashing to the ground

Needle brought me comfort to keep me stable
Comfort paid for
Comfort is all that I got

My god left me without one word of warning
My god left me
My god is all that I got

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger, crashing down
All my life I've seen your anger
Crashing to the ground

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger, crashing down
All my life I've seen your babies
Crashing to the ground

Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid",Final Thoughts and the Last Day on Earth,1999
David Usher,"What if I were you and you were me
Still can't see the forest fire beyond the trees
Now I'm standing in a field of green
The colours burning far as I can see
What do you see?

On my tongue, the galaxies so small
Here I'll drink it down and watch the world dissolve
Now I'm pouring through the universe and slipping
Through the endless stream of time
What would you find?

And I'm flying, floating on the wind again
Hoping it will drag me in
Can't you see I'm laughing?
Laughing at the consequence
Laughing at this circumstance
Don't you know by now?

Wave at all the faces; they go by
Faster that we live, the more we die
Now I'm crashing through the open door
And smiling in a most peculiar way
What would you say?

And I'm falling faster than the waterfall
Opened up and after all
Can't you see I'm drowning
Right here in the open air?
Wishing I could still go clear
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are

Flying, floating on the wind again
I'm wishing that you'd drag me in
Can't you see I'm hoping
Wishing I could see myself
Wishing I was someone else?
But don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are",Forestfire,1999
