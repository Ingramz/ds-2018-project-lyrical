Action Bronson,"And when I find out who did it, 
It won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
It'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill
And when his eyes go dead the hell 
I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him

Yo, time on my hands
Running fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Hit the Jackie Rob
Cop the Hershey
Spark the bark for the ride back to the Galaxy
Back, back, down, forward, kick
That's a fatality
For Liu Kang, turn to a dragon then a raven
Ain't no professor that can fuck with this verbatim
Your style is prenatal
I got the hand that rock the cradle
Fully auto mac under the table
Jewish platters, kreplach soups and sable
If you ain't stable, don't hang around cause I enable
Drug use, dick sucks from a fiend
Rib eye steaks that still on a bone
Me and my team shine
Like hologram fishscale right off the Greek coast
Toast to greats with bubbles
Three states, three cases, no traces
I'm the ace to shovels
So sick, muthafucka cover face with muzzles (Yeah!)
Flushing, Queens, twenty seven years strong
Where you think you're gonna run to when the tears gone
And reality set just like the sun do
Ain't trying to have my babies raised up in the slum, true!

And when I find out who did it, 
It won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
It'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill
And when his eyes go dead the hell 
I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him

C'mon, you son of a bitch
Damn, he's slick

No love for snitch niggas trying to serenade the precinct
Singing about granulated onions that ain't used for seasoning
My mind is off, this life gave me a different type of reasoning
I'm so New York that I could rep it from a different region
Slay heffers, Ottomanelli's got 'em in telly's
We eat good, Turkish cuisine, Ottoman belly's
We sit in whips and our whips sit on Pirelli's
While we're getting dick sucks, my whole team is Akinyele's
Put in their mouth, let 'em give 'em second chances
I'm known for finger banging bitches giving table dances
Open my flip book, see me posted in the sickest stances
Glorious garments, you could get some style by taking glances
Red snapper, taken apart, put back together
Plated on some bok choy, fine fish platters forever (Yo!)
Same routine, another day, a new endeavor
I usually rock a power piece under a Polo leather

I write left, think right, need the box tight
Mind blowing dome cause I always eat the box right
Make believers out of haters, haters out of homies
Bring my fam to the top so I ain't lonely
I'm with the team, cuisine like we celebrating
Contemplate the takeover when we delegating
Get it shaking like a dancer at Perfections
Catch us in a European coupe, it's never rented, kid
Been getting it, circle full of amateurs
See great rappers smoking seeded up cannabis
Fucking embarrassment, we cooler than a Vick's rub
You the type to trick it all night at a strip club
I'm the type to bag a stripper out front
Take her back, line a twenty up and get my shit sucked (Yeah!)
That's what you do when you flyer than Goldblum
Purple label loafers, paying homage to the old school

I'm from Brooklyn, the reason why I walk with a bop
Same reason I don't fuck with the cops
My borough is thorough, if any nigga try to tell me it's not
I'll leave his face bloodied up, all covered in knots
We break bread at the table with made niggas and sip wine
And graduate from little niggas, now we living big time
I'm in a state of mind like Nas in his prime
That real New York talk, home of gritty and grime
Check it, I got the cleanup, Bronsonelli's batting lead off
Your mother's mouth is the place where I drop my seeds off
Hop in the Lamborghini, middle finger speed off
D's are getting P'd off, they're present, drop the weed off
I'm like a cross between Stoudemire and Carmelo
Half these New York whack rappers are soft as Jell-O
Since a little nigga, always been a fly fellow
Went from dark brown skin into a high yellow",Chuck Person,2011
Action Bronson,"As I step in the door, you in your bathrobe
Pour you a little more wine, I see your glass low
Scared of a real man, from dealing with these assholes
Just drink ya wine and then will step up in the bath, slow
Soak your body, cause its begging for a loving touch
Light the candle, and I'ma light another Dutch
Then we slip into a place that's only you & me
Put it deep, like the bottom of the bluest sea
You too young to be locked down, truancy
Always got ya hair down, rockin' your jewelry
Killing these other bitches, word, reading their eulogy'
Hips insane
The pussy? Foolery
At the end of the day baby it's you and me
At the end of the day honey it's you and me
Just you and me",Forbidden Fruit,2011
Action Bronson,"Lace up your Timbs, Queens, fresh off the blacktop
All foreign recital ? fiends on the backlot
Back alley Bronson always cookin' up a mad plot
The shit that have us laid in Benzes with a glass top
Hash pot, stickin' out the dash spot
I'll leave a bitch in a vacant and let his ass rot
One seven for ? an autobahn is where the cash drop
Then take the paper, then distribute to the have-nots
I'm on the scene, 26, and I'm a manchild
'Lo machete, hoppin' out the fan's style ?
Whether fightin' or graffiti, got them hand styles
I'll wipe the floor up with your face like a ShamWow
Hands down, one motherfucker
260 combined, here to bring the ruckus
The bassline plus the words raise the crime rate
Bronsolini show 'em how to hold a 9 straight

Yo, get off the next man's P.P
Be original, kid, get off the P.P
Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P
Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P

Yo, the drugs are rolled up, the money fold up
I like my bitches big-body like an old truck
With their waists sliced inches like the cold cuts
Been at the bottom of the sea, but then I rose up
Feet first, my voice is known to curl a honey's toes
Serve a pound of that, I'll leave 'em with a bloody nose
Smoke the hash, take it, form like a puddy, holmes
Hop in the Caddy, leave your body by a muddy road
A dirty rotten scoundrel like Steve Martin
Drugs so good, Fiend Weekly just three-starred 'em
I'm on the road, blow trees through East Harlem
Just put me in a cage in the basement, I'm retarded
German shift, twist, burn to bliss
I love it when the pussy tighter like a tourniquet
Copped the chicken, started cookin' and converted it
Dutch leaf, third of it, roll it up, murder it

Yo, get off the next man's P.P
Be original, kid, get off the P.P
Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P
Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P",Get Off My P.P.,2011
Action Bronson,"From the Colosseum Block to the Island, ""What the blood clot?""
Stay designing, always wiling, and we puff pot
Queens to Brooklyn, no lies, give 'em 'nought shot
Chicken been getting jerked before your little nuts dropped
You know the mantra, Tyson in El Fonta?
The i-tal jockey keep me fucking like a monsta'
Her landing strip is red like hair that's on Tatanka
I'm steady diving in chocolate like Willy Wonka
I take a knee and shoot a duck in the air
Five minutes, I'm making stuffing filled with truffles and pears
I'm lapping ""Go,"" while you only move a couple of squares
But still take out some time to do some drugs in the stairs
""Freeze! Lay on your stomach,"" what the popo said
My team selling the patties, getting cocoa bread
Babylon, them have to catch me, burn up on the irie!
Never die, I'ma give it to you my way!
Yo, peace to the chicken spot, peace to patty spot
Peace to the types of spot that Veggie Castle dready spot
The dollar van, the Wallabe and Reggie spot
And if a coward wanna rump I give him seven shots

(Y'all won't test we?) I'm in the corner puffing Marley
Got the knife inside the booth, hoping they don't shoot
'Cause I don't want to hurt nobody, ow

(Y'all won't test we?) I'm in the corner puffing Marley
Got the knife inside the booth, hoping they don't shoot
'Cause I don't want to hurt nobody, ow

Ay, ya no wan' rump with the senior
Who lean like he mixed Jamaican rum and tequila
Trail a load of hoes from Kingston and Montego
Keep dick hard like Rottweiler Mandingo
Bob Marley ganja, stuffed up in the fanta
Pass dutchie towards San Fransisco
Where your nephew bout to bounty kill a punaani
Hoes know the movado!
Lick a shot for (Windsweep?)
I am living dangerously, Beretta
Leafy make the girl wine like Beenie ""Sim Simma""
Keys to my new bitch bimma, her name Serena
Rastafarian reefer got me feeling so irie, tranquil and leisure
Berry salmon and jerk chicken
Oxtail, gravy on white rice and fried plantain",Jerk Chicken,2011
Action Bronson,"Bronsolino
Fuck that sitting-down rap type shit, man
I stand up, cause I'm a motherfucking man
And I'm motherfucking hot

Peep it
I'm on the third floor, your class was in the basement
You know what that means; you got a hint of retardation
Well, me too, I'm fully-blown just like the flow, though
Spit the silky shit that's ankle-length like a kimono
Uh, sharp instruments to rock like a fossil
Shotty for the haters, that's trimmed off at the nostrils
Well, me and Docker eating dinner at the brothel
Never sniff that blanco, that's word to OJ's Bronco
Cop a Dutch and break it open, overfill it
I'm rollin' in the car, it may be shaky, never spill it, though
Cause when I rhyme, I feel possessed by El Espirito
Encounters of a Third Kind, X-Rays on the visual
Ginger ale and hot sauce, two things I live by
I'm such a chill guy, but fuck around and, yes, you will die
Green DeVille, right, green drugs, but hold the serum
Rub the things together, then you clear 'em, flatline
The prosciutto, olives from Tunisia
Drums are hittin' hard because they chopped up like a cleaver
And yes I'm smokin' all the reefer
The night creeper
I love the pussy really tight, that's with a light Caesar
Can it be that I'm the Golden Child, the chosen one
The piggies saying freeze, but every time they did I chose to run
Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the boulder, silver bullet through you shoulder, son
Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade
I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid
Yo, take a taste of my nuts
Know they sweet just like the candy
Dick is the same color as Band-Aid, understand me?
I built this building, they came and then I conquered
Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde
Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name
I'm working hard because that's what I need to maintain
Killer Queens is on the rise, so understand me
Ain't never stoppin' 'til there's a Grammy in a room for my family
Also known as a den
Post and toast with Lauren
Posing for pictures, kicking scriptures that form up a phlegm

Uh, let me take a little break fam'
I'm fucking straight out of surgery, man
I need a little break
When I come back in, I'mma come back in hard, though
I promise you that
(Look at my motherfucking shoulders, son)

Yo, I'm diving in like Louganis
I'm aiming right for that anus
Trying to give her a payment to rent the pussy like Avis
Peace to Shaevitz & Shaevitz
My rhymes are seasoned for flavor
Fuck with shorties that's in shape, they got the V like they're Vader
Ah ha, Animal Style, flippin' like a flipjack
You heard the cat rap, like animal's fear from a rat, got
Ankle length, that's suede, the jacket
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Do the Chatatimmy Shimmy like a crackhead
No one compare to me, lampin' with my tangerine
I'm fiend out, so I'm bangin' on the tambourine
Yo, bring the drugs and call me when you on the corner
And I'mma send the doja down in case they run up on ya
Your style is celibate, I'm elegant, trust
My style is liver and I'm ivory like a elephant tusk
Swirl the wine inside the glass that got the delicate musk
Shoe be pointy at the toe, closin' down the show
Poison be the flow, got the boysenberry blow
Finish on the women
That mean the bitch from Finland
Her tits are bonkers
Chilling in her chanclas
Rollers in her hair, I'm running through it, Larry Csonka

Bronsolino
You don't even know who fucking Larry Csonka is, man
Get the fuck off my wee-wee
Pussy",Larry Csonka,2011
Action Bronson,"Ayo, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready right, the fast life
Getting twisted almost every night, my mind is deeper
Than the voice featured on Barry White, I'm not the marry type
I make her sit in vinegar to get the candy tight
I’m flattered at all the chatter and comparisons
To the great, soon to see me right on Madison
Bally sneakers trying to stay up out the vat of sins
I tout the tacky shit I'm like a wild Iraqi
Outdoors with my sport vest, leather on the shoulder
Hold the rifle in place, knife in your face
I’m out the world just like a lightning in space
The ice sculptures on the table going nice with the plates of grapes

This is madness, certified madness
Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage
Single-handedly slam you to the canvas
Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage

Fuck the love, I want the money and the pussy
Brazilian bitches, names tatted on their tushie
You're a man dressed as a woman, call him Tootsie
I'm in the corner with a hooker playing footsie
Phone in my hands at all times like I'm a pimp, fuck shrimp
We eat steak, wine and cheese plate
Bronsonline the name is ringing out in each state
Play it cool or taste the weapon, time to meet fate
My feet slide just like a hockey player
Eating yakitori, getting hammered in the sake lair
Sucky sucky, happy ending shower
Wifey making dinner, I’ll be home about an hour
Crush the sour, dutches from the Netherlands
My rolling skills is undefeated yo you’ll never win
I bring the devil in, Bronson known for his benevolence
Polo fitted with a leather grip

This is madness, certified madness
Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage
Single-handedly slam you to the canvas
Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage

I wash my dick in the sink right when I wake up
Twisted from the night before raw inside a frightening whore
Hop in the whip and go for breakfast
Fried eggs and prime steak that's straight from out of Texas
Damn I’m living reckless, smoking all day just like the brisket
My beard is golden brown just like a biscuit
Everyday I’m thinking should I risk it, add another number to statistics
Or use the breast milk to eat my Crispix
I’ll feed her coke for a dick suck
Put a fucking roman candle up in this bitch butt
Now it’s on the computer, got the pussy moister than Bermuda
Pop a hole right through her throat, that’s no joke cause I'mma shoot her

Yeah, damn, yo, fuck
Yo, three verses ain't enough anymore these days man? Fuck

This shit is rawer than a tuna on a plate for eighty dollars
Or the sex that I be having though I hate my baby momma
It’s always drama, she got too much time on her hands
Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your man
My eyes are open like an owl though
Animosity, trying to get the paper, sour dough
But if I die before the hour go
Just place the Bally's on my feet and smoke my body like a pharaoh ho
Egyptian fixtures, patties by the coliseum
Guns from Russia, I turn 'em to a ballerina
Cop the work then they bagging coke
Transporting interstate, Carolina to Tobacco Road
To the knee or to the ankle where the jacket go
Master flow work now so I got cash to blow
When I’m older, leather on a rugby shoulder
I’m top dogging if I’m lying may they slump me over",The Madness,2011
Action Bronson,"Aw yeah! We in the motherfuckin' place tonight!
Show's about to start guys, everybody get to your seats
Bronsolinio's comin' to the stage
Mmm, knew about the local things what they all talkin' about

Step in the door, Bronsolini, the mayor
The kush replayer, 80's bushy pussy gushy slayer
I'm a star and I'mma prove it
Saw me in the foreign car, shorty had a movement
Comin to your town, lockin' it down, rockin' it out
I'm on fire there's no stoppin' it now, it's tournament edition
Shorty on the arm an ornament for fishin'
Brussels eatin' breakfast in the Orient for chicken, listen
Know my mother wanna see me win
Slide the crack inside the slot you put your CD in
Give a couple bucks, let me live, puff a dutch
Cause ain't no motherfucker playin' me in Suckerpunch
It's my time, no more standin' in line
Now it's time to eat, paired up with the rarest of wine
Hair red just like the meat, never careless with mine
Play your part and stay sharp daddy, cherish your crime

Aye yo, you couldn't wait to hear this fly shit
Shorty open up your thighs quick, smoke the pussy like a Thai stick
My style is lovin' in the island by Dubai dick
I leave my socks right on the floor cause this is my shit
Intoxicatin' aroma, drugs rolled in a diploma
Beautiful wine, we in Sonoma yo
The cheese plate, fish a pike out the lake
Take a dyke on a date, she let me pipe cause I'm an ape
White limey, maneuver at night, fuck assumption
Bronsolin' bring the truth to the light, that we the best
And ain't no motherfucker tellin' me different
Most talent and I practice, ain't no shock that I'm winnin'
Double-layered linens
Known for sinnin' in cinnamon women in tinted renteds
Cinderella pendants, the Lord flow tremendous
All I got is myself so fuck a co-defendant
Struck ass stripper, she tried to play me yo the whore's demented

Bronsolinio, Amuse Bouche
Just a little fuckin' taste of that mouth bitch",Moonstruck,2011
Action Bronson,"When I’m alone
Smoking weed, sitting by the window in my home
Often thinking why the fuck is it I’m not in Rome
If I had a little motivation, money, and a hot body
I see it now Bronson a heart-throbby
No more pigging out, binging on the late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight
No more packing hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right
40 pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right
I’m eating salad but I’m leaving off the croutons
Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier than UConn
Savings on the cookies, mommy clipping out the coupons
Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on the futon
Lock the refrigerator, there’s no controlling me
Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin' hold on me
Ain’t trying to be laid in a box, roses on me
Bronsolino running 5 miles for the glory

Lets go, 20 more to go baby boy
Yo you want that V by the crotch right?
Yeah lets go (I want it)
Gimme some pushups
Gimme some dips (I can’t no more)
Let me get some jumping jacks (Gimme a sandwich!)
Yeah you want that steak dinner don’t you? (Ah)
Your gonna work that sandwich off now (I need marshmallows!)
Yeah lets fuckin go
20 more miles, lets go you fat fuck
(Ah marshmallows, give it to me)
You motherfucker, you, fuck you!

From Philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque
I’m getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute
An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer
Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer
Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened
Sneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping
I don’t want know one to know that I took it
Cause I'm an over-eater (Hey, yo, uh, fry the mayonnaise for me, man)
Life is a smorgasbord to me and I’ma over do it
I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don’t cut it
Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded
The shit they model in Milan that’s looking crispy custom
5 and 6 bitches, lickin’ my dick twitches
Serve up a facial, miss the Belgium bitches dismiss em
For now I’ll take what I can get till this shit switches
Whatever fuck you stupid bitch
Yo here’s to the Drums of Heaven
Here’s to beef ribs
Extended lunch time I eat enough for three kids
Go on a diet, then fall off because I’m weak kid
Since I was young I’m eatin’ candy on the sneak tip
My day is based upon fine drugs, cholesterol
Though at my height and weight i'm probably still the best at ball
I’m tatted up, I have no shame to show the chest at all
I bet I have your lady humming on my testicles

Yeah, Bronsolino
Bout to be fuckin', summer time in the winter
Shirtless",Ronnie Coleman,2011
Action Bronson,"We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain
Inside the coupe. Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid

Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu ne tappa me, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
Fila jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going ""Boom Shakalaka!"" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, 'cause
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you
Bye, peace, one, fuck you",Shiraz,2011
Action Bronson,"Exhale the fucking essence
Absorb me

Peace to Lonnie Londell
Everything is Mar-vel
Kid, on this side we shine like the sun
Though the night brisk on the night shift
Peep the tight lips
Cause muthafucking loyalty is priceless
Fly bitch blow me harder than a vuvuzelo
My mood is mellow
Catch me hopping out the Cougar, yellow
Brew the Bustelo, Brosonlino
Smooth as Othello in convertible Z3's bruising the pedal
Chief of command, it's hard for you to try to see me
Your team ain't ready to win a war like Mussolini
Harsh as a Russian winter
Still we dining at Lupa right there on Bleecker and Thompson
Eating a custom dinner
Wine served, about a third of the glass filled
Premium rap skills, lounging in the Catskills
Let me end this with a kiss from my bitch
One love, Bronsonlino, signing off
Who better than this, kid?

Luxury sports apparel is what I rock to cover feet
I feel like everyday is Thanksgiving
That's how we usually eat
Rep the street, my flow is heat
Queens made me complete
When we outside deep
It's like a Double L retreat
You know my status, everything's Mar-vel
Hard shell shots will tear you up
Now you scar well
Bizarre hell, I'll take you there
Never fear nothing, not me
Shellfish specialist, I'll eat it if it's from the sea
Action Bronson is in the building
So it smells like half a key
He's usually smoking marijuana in a jacket past his knee
Yeah, we live this, still crispest
Back to business, fuck bitches
Most of y'all were living blind until I hit the light switches
Peace to my dress code and my way of life
Super trife, slay your wife
Ask about the way Lauren can lay the pipe
Never duplicated, wordplay is custom made
Niggas know my steez
Catch me in Queens covered in suede (word up!)

The fine fabric delegates
And Peter Pan Posse
This the finale, Youtube is where the fans watch me
High definition, Lo religion
Loving Scottie Pippen's
Switched it from Jordan Dream Team
It hurt the slutty women
Love to collab, I used to dabble in a couple of things
Facelift the Team, Outdoors, where the Men's will be
Cop Killer Queens, the Upper East, we need a gallery
We unscripted, real drama, never no fallacies
I might party like a rock star for a couple of days
A couple strays tag along taking bumps of K
I keep a Buddha, little liquor, make me triple stack
Ideal wifey, small titties and a lot of ass
They call me Shaz, before it was my government
Unholy covenant, could never get enough of it

So pay attention when this rich bong's broken in half
And don't get left behind to choke on my gas
Ginger ale, juggle, Gen Pop, pockets intact
Prime king in the booth
I got it like that
But wait, audible react
Don't get caught in the trap
Real recognize real
And see it's part of the act
I break hearts, surround sound
With the sermon I spit
And leave behind a trail of permanent drips
In a room full of douchebags burning their lips
And bugging out about the right amount of water to mix
The freebase specialist, I dug him a ditch
Struggling with that addiction's a son of a bitch, fucko
I'll give you something to fix, get sober
You'll understand when you're older
The rap Al Bundy got the handicapped boner
Hot breath and the ice cold shoulder
So, give me room so my set can breathe
I'm from the Up East, plus I got connects in Queens
So how you want it?
Bent, skeed or straight blunted
My rap good like Deer Park in your stomach

Incredible Hulk, flash the villainous smile
He trying to stay young, he's never going out of style
Fresh to death like the corpse out the morgue
The new slang stay stiff, pause
No shirt when he record
Stay zoned, known to kick rap through payphones
Mighty Healthy set the tones
Spread the wealth through fly poems
Well known rap flesh
Keep it tight like close homies
And never known to flip like a Solid Gold Cody
Known to keep it scummy like a Sunday at Jones Beach
Known to keep it bummy like a Sunday at Centre Street
Known for having fun, blacking out, that's the motto
@toechamp, twitter game you should follow
US Weekly with the centerfold
A thousand tapes pressed up
A thousand tapes sold
Kids screaming out, ""when the mixtape coming?""
Streets is fiend out, yo, they really need something
Understood, no matter what
Shine like the sun

Action Bronson,"Uhh man, I just want to thank you
Ridin on this muthafuckin' mission with us
From Queens to Boston, all around the muthafuckin' planet

As the ganja gets evaporated
Tellin' all these bitches beat me cause I'm activated
Rockin '97 Maxes with the double bubble wrapped around the bottom
Old Gold twisted like the cap that's on the bottle
Mash on the throttle, swish, shoot expose the ankle
Swiss chocolate lay up in the bed like a blanket
Ready to smang it, smash it and bang it
No more fruit punch in the crib so I guess I'll have to Tang it
Young Bronson, blade runner, Rutger Hauer
Sticky fingers cause that's what I use to crush the sour
Suede shoe like the natives in the teepee
22's drop Z3, get off the peepee
Beep beep, twist the laser key, press the clutch

Out there on the Queens Ave

Playing the mirrors like a diva cause I'm paranoid
And plus I'm smoking drugs, you're just a token thug
Fuck around your words will lay you in a woven rug
I'm Middle Eastern, Iron Sheik with the cobra clutch
We see the lights so I force them into chasing me
Early morning money like the people in the bakery
Fancy drapery, rep the family faithfully
Criminal minded, do it tastefully
Shorty catching cases, couple priors open
Serve fiends same shit Richard Pryor smokin'
My speech be concrete lying, defeat a web
And even if you were a basket couldn't see the bread
We want the Caesar salad table-side
The waiter toss it get the flavor right
The shorty with me got the piercing in the naval
Seven bitches with me and I'm 'bout to give 'em anal

Heinous with the stainless, plus we Shameless like the Gallaghers
Black, e-b-I-t so we ain't looking at no calendars
Gliding like Islanders
Pistols equipped with silencers
Load 'em, point 'em at challengers, be triple beam balancers
I'm feeling claustrophobic with success surrounding us
And fuck a groupie cause we been have bitches hounding us
Way before this thing called rap came into play
I change my rugby's and the pussy I fuck like every day
Sex, money and yay, sip the Henessey for energy
We giants, dropping science, if you're smart pick up the chemistry
Repping for New York heavily, getting my money steadily
Meyhem Lauren and Bronsolinyo that's the recipe
Dun, it's destined we won, my legacy spun
A lot of people in the right direction, despite aggression
Divine prevention bag ounces by eye with perfection

They tried to bag me for the blunt, I had the bundle by the grundle
I'm running on the humble, acrobatic tumble
Oh shit, the floor exercise a perfect ten
Marisol, we make her swallow drugs then she birthing twins
Then fly no propeller, street bread my acapella
Vintage raps from out the cellar, Madagascar vanilla
Where color kicks match your buy work
And then we ?
From Queens I was just in my teens, holdin' the ratchet
I slice the garlic with the razor, somewhere out in Asia
When it come to paper, family, everything is major
The North American elk behind the oven door
We're trying to find a common ground, is it love or war?
Remain extravagant we known to floss objects inanimate
Shining but never arrogant, from 40 Park to Feroget
Rocking the finest ? designers ?

You the type to shave your face to make your anus bushy

Like a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism

She started flipping over little shit
Became a bigger problem, and she pregnant, what I'ma do?
I went the coward route, what a fucking jerk
I hated myself for years and thought I made up
All the pent up anger in a while, and tell me straight up
Do you love me? Then what's the next step?
It's either 'yes' or 'no' before you take your next breath
Remember the days you held me on your chest?
I listened to your heart, gentle kisses on your breast
You said I was your king, or was it just a show?
But we don't even talk, so I guess I'll never know
How does a love so strong just fall to pieces?

Hide my eyes cause I'm sickened with the image
Abusing marijuana, sipping vintage for the time being
My skills set is very serious, in fact
Spit a wild rap, carve a steak right off the cow's back
Throw it on the grill, I'm cooking in the stew
Same shit that's on the grill gave me leather for the boot
If they make me take the stand then I'm lying through my teeth though
Ask to swear to God but in that I don't believe though
My man Stevie Mo playing safety for Toledo
Hustle 'til my fingers staying cheesy like a cheeto
Shorty on the bed pleasuring my pee pee

Open up cigars and fill 'em with a bunch of Marley
Double cut porterhouse straight from Luger's
Ruger for intruders hand to hand made by the duelers

To a place where the world moves slowly, I'm feeling lonely
No one to hold me, no one to console me
My drug use out of control, I hit the road
Leaving behind all the memories of yore
Not of drinking, but it had me sipping Hennessey for sure
My daily thoughts are 'what's the penalty for raw?'
When I should be making money singing records on a tour
But I'm stuck in a room, living with mommy
Telling bitches not to scream so loud, serving salami

Searching for daylight, I promise that I'll change
Before I see the grave, never that, fingers crossed
Every day it seems I'm talking to the wall more
Hallucinations, bugging, digging up the floorboards

Every day I'm moving further from sobriety

At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel

Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes

She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

Love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a flying duck
Nothing but a buckshot, chck-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf!

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this, ""Ho, I'm the meanest""
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, on shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich pot shit
Hoes on some God shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

Swiftly, I shift the Beamer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth (uh)
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse (uh)
Red roses drop on boxes very often (uh)
Confetti torture, drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton (uh)
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon (Sarandon)
The cloud of smoke like the phantom (uh)
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham (Big KRIT, shawty)

Spit like my last breath, casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, ‘86er, nigga, that’s my born year
Get the fuck from ‘round here, that’s just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma’s titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin’ hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won’t have to drop another album
B.b. King saw the king in me, so why can’t you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past fuck your Louis flag,
Popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass

We all deserve a dedication to the fandom
Hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the six in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma, my look is Jay Buhner
Dawggie cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio
I been wild

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gore-tex in case of drizzle

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wassabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of
My clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

Yo I'm a 635, dip or fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses I lead them to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfucking faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat

And half is what I'll do to Mac Miller

A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixer
Taps slicker than past tiller
Goes around the room like his cats get finna
Oh you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Triller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from
Malcolm, I knock the thoughts off your balcony
King, you're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey row
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever

Passenger's side with Ruger, kinda sewer
My mind is a sewer, infested with garbage
Crime, rhyming and music, disrespecting the market
Like a Mexican martyr, boy, I do it to death
Nothing left with the carcass, squeeze a Tec on the target
Aim the wreck at your artist, flames, a mess on the carpet
Then hit everything except for the daughter
Cat burglar to a merciful murderer
Certainly not with the circus, they trying serve
I'm either too hood for my own good
Or I'm too good for my own hood
Cold is the climate in the hearse
Where they found me in the dirt, too demonic for the church
I body any and everybody until the day they put my body in the earth
This is ghetto gossip while I work

Live from Venice, the something menace
Put me in the Guinness for raising hell up for all the sinners
High as tinters, violinists, I string them all along
Tied to the flow like water skis in the red ocean
Hang like an apostrophe, any MC no Qu'ran
I prayed to the God, then prayed on their bodies all at once
Sun setting, never regretting the day's events are gone
Forgive me for my sins, with everything that I ?

I don't trust the score, I've been baffled by judges' cards before
Never leave it in their hands, that's the art of war
I learned the proper punching power started from the floor
Ground up, renovate, a wall is just another door
Resurrected like the phoenix, blazing every stage
Spread my wings and fly, but gravity's a heavy cage
Hellfire and heaven's rage on every page
Revelation propaganda, maybe it's the seven plagues
Aiming at the tower, same commercial, different station
They stuck on training wheels and tracing paper, vapor chasing
I'm half amazing, a quarter sinner, a quarter savior
Fascinated, Rakaa seen the wretched paint the righteous painting
My travel agent's favorite, preacher's son, no sign of fading
The lights weaponized, fireworks at night displaying
The blazing arrows fly, a thousand points of light just raining
Careful when you're in the quarters, chariots are hydroplaning

Kept the dope, boy, and I ain't even need a golden chain

Shit was once an open game, we got it by a rope and chain
Losing all control of wild paintings in my broken brain

I lose some sails
And my boss won't be happy
But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices
Splendid in perfection
From the reels of this record that I found

Every day there's a boy in the mirror
Asking me what I am doing here
Finding all my previous motives
Growing increasingly unclear
I traveled far and I burned all the bridges
I believed that soon as I had land
All the other options now before me
Will wither in the light of my plan
So I lose some sails and my boss won't be happy
But there's only one thing on my mind
Search in boxes, underneath the counter
On a chance that only tape I find
A sun forth, someone that needs somewhere
To long for
Someone who needs somewhere
To long for.

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you

That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2003

Every good day breeds it

Kick the throat you used to kiss.
Push face into concrete.
A smile, a giant fist.
The bloody face of bliss.
And as I gasp for my last breath,
I crawl back into your perfect poison arms.

Sitzt er im Gold des Abends, wenn sich die Sonne senkt
Dort, wo des Gauchos Herde über die Weiden zieht
Singt er der kleinen Niña zärtlich sein schönstes Lied

Der Mond hält seine Wacht
Wenn in der Nacht
Ein goldener Stern dir winkt
Der Mond, der sieht von fern
Wie dieser Stern
Das Glück dir bringt

Ei - ja, tschiba, tschiba
Niña, Niña, ich bin dir nah, so nah
Ei - ja, tschiba, tschiba

Über die grünen Weiden zog er so manches Jahr
Als seine Señorita längst seine Niña war
Schön, wie die weiße Rose, war sie für ihn erblüht
Und unter ihrem Fenster sang er sein Liebeslied

And I wish you could just know what it is that I see 
'Cause if you ever wanted to I just can't say 
If I ever really could, make you feel this way 

And this should be able to withstand so much more 
When we're falling apart I can't determine what's in store 
A friendship is a sacred bond that should bare all 
But threatened now, and vanishing, it makes me stall 

If I could only find the way to make you 
See how much I want the best 
If I could just describe the words that 
Don't put us to the test 
'Cause if I go to deep you might be scared 
If I say too much you won't be there 
If I try too hard I think 
You might not ever see what's so unfair 

I need you like the way it was 
Not so very long ago 
And just like you I want this thing to stop its death 
And start to grow 
We should be doing so much better 
We used to work together 
But what I can do now I just don't know 

If maybe you hadn't ever looked at me that way 
And if maybe your eyes had never lightened up my day 
If maybe your lips had never curled over your teeth 
Then maybe when you smiled
I never would have felt so weak 

If maybe we'd never hugged before 
If one kiss had just once been then been no more 
If this bond had never climbed to the foreground 
Well I'm not sure if it would be like this
Where no one else is worth being around 

I want this to work more than anything in the world

Adam Abraham,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

With a mission and a goal below

We don't want to know
And forgotten are the cross, and the naked and the lost
And the lover of the tired and cold

I've learned of this religion
But I've lost my peaceful vision
Girl ghost is in the stairway
She likes it when I rub my eyes
Deep will I dig, I

So give a smile and a cringe to the lunatic fringe
I'm a little tired of saying so
See the spin and the whirl of a wide-eyed girl
Still digging for an honest soul
But I don't want to, you don't want to
We don't want to know
And dying on the cross for the sick and the lost

She likes him so

He's just a joker flash and cheap
And not to fussy where he sleeps
Before he starts to complain

Where there's a will there's a way
I think you'd agree if you saw her

Seen the movie and knows
All the streets lead to somewhere
And the pavement's gold

You must do it everyday
When the morning comes
Don't you turn around and say
It's bound to end in tears
So let's do it anyway

And not as dumb as they thought
She had a good head on her shoulders

They'd give her the money and diamonds
Be queen for a day

I take it serious, but I still like a joke

I want those who get to know me
to become admirers or my enemies

Take it up or leave it
I'm not gonna change a bit
If it means heartache
then leave it out for your sake
I tried and I try tried
but still you say that I lied
Nobody's perfect so leave me if you object

Keep your philosophy
it doesn't apply to me
If it means heartache
then leave it out for your sake, your sake

Darling darling it's all you

It's sex that sets your mind and body free
I'ts sex stay away from the HIV
Sex open the lock if you got the key
Sex made you and sex made me
So let's turn it up let's turn it down
It's better the second time around

Push push 'cause I like it like that
So I push push and then she pushed back said
Don't stop it's never felt better
I think I'd like to carry on forever",Beautiful Dream,1995
Adam Ant,"It's burning holes into my heart
To leave that face so tenderly
I know that I can't stop the pain
But oh the pain cannot stop me

Into a heart so lost and broken
An angel seized the pain
Swallow her breath hold her to my chest
I feel so warm in love again

Right from the first time I made love with you
I had nothing in life to compare that moment to
But it's gotta be a sin
Gotta be a sin
Gotta be a sin
Yeah it's gotta be a sin
Gotta be a sin 
Gotta be a sin

I want to wake up really early
Want the first thing that I see
To be your eyes still softly closed
And your lips waiting patiently

I know the saddest sight in this world
Is you climbing out of bed
Vision you are clipping on that bra
Maybe we'll stay in bed instead

Cause nothing
Oh nothing
That feels that good can be street legal
Nothing
Oh nothing
That feels that good
Has ever happened to me now

Just holding your hand is like making love
Just standing next to you is like making love
So let's tie our shirts together and rig up a sail
Just want to do the things we did before
Oh some more so
",Gotta Be a Sin,1995
Adam Ant,"You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Crawling like a helpless infant on the floor
You turn down bread for the want of a steak
What's worth waking up in a cold sweat for?
You know it could have been good
And it could have been fine you know
You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Devastated they don't really give a damn
As you wait around for someone to do it all for you
You know they gonna make you pay through the nose
On the very rare occasions that they do
The more innocent you are
The more you will know you say
You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Oh you
Don't need opinion
Don't need a mirror
Believe that you're enough
And you
Tapped at my shoulder
Captured my heart
I thought your name was love
Thought you name was love
It's just an image of yourself
Just an image of yourself",Image of Yourself,1995
Adam Ant,"I want your heart,
I want your soul,
I want everything you hold dear.
I want the sinews that bind you together.
I know enough is never enough.
I want the broad road and twenty-twenty vision.
Your wrist, a keyboard of perfume,
Money cannot buy.
And I'm in a position to say 
The camera does not lie.
There's a lot of vampires out there,
Hanging out to grab your soul.
They don't live in Transylvania.
They don't live in rock 'n' roll.
I want your bones,
I want your blood,
I want everything you hold dear.
I want the sinews that bind you together.
I made an educated guess.
There's a panic in the lingerie.
You know I tremble at each touch.
Close my eyes and sigh,
Then fly off like a bullet
For the darkside of the sky.
I want you pain,
I want your pleasure,
I want everything you hold dear.
I want the sinews that bind you together.
I know enough is never enough;
Hatcheck to showgirl.
Let's get to bed, madam.
I know there's no way out but through together.
Wet with sex,
Wet with sweat.
Embody your body.
There's a lot of vampires out there,
Hanging out to grab your soul.
They don't live in Transylvania.
They don't live in rock 'n' roll.

I thought you was my friend
But all you did was lie
And now I carry this until the day I die
I keep on riding till the sun goes from the sky

Sometimes the bear gets you
I know it's the only fight you got
Look what it's done to you

I carry this .357 in my hand

If you don't want to understand

I travel light 'cause I am the outsider
I travel light 'cause I'm a very good fighter
I travel light all through the day
And through the night

It's gonna take more than reaction
Much more than a brave attempt
You're gonna need skin like a rhino
To face such cold contempt

I drive in style I drive a '99 beamer
And you just wait until the time that I see ya
You better look again before you look away
I will be driving by the kings highway

Very very

Very long ride

I keep on moving now until I reach the end

You will find yourself on the wrong end of the slaps

Adam Argyle,"There’s times when I fake goodbyes, made you cry
But this time you don’t
And I was only joking, I was broken when you told me to go

Don’t make up the wrong mind
Don’t forget the good times

Let me stay a little longer
'Cause if I’m gone I can’t make it right
In just one night we could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won’t take long I know
Don’t let me go, oh, don’t let me go

I’m not giving up, I’m still in love, it's all I need you to say
And I don’t need an answer
Just a chance to make the pain go away

In just one night we could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong

Don’t let me go, oh, don’t let me go

I beg you to find what it takes to forgive me of all my mistakes
'Cause if I walk out of your life there’ll be no way back this time
Don't let me go

Don’t make up the wrong mind
Don’t forget the good times

Stay a little longer
'Cause if I’m gone I can’t make it right

Adam Brand,"Grandpa had a piano it was built in 1904
He brought it down from Sydney town before the First World War
He'd sit down and crack his knuckles put his glasses on his head
When he'd start to play the cat would run and hide behind the bed

Well his right foot stomped the pedals and his left foot stomped the floor
His wrinkled hands would skip the keys that wouldn't play no more
He'd play Onward Christian Soldiers and the window panes would shake
When the man of 87 played his old 88

The piano sat in a corner on a sagging hardwood floor
On top was a frame I made for him with a picture of the Lord.
A faded baptist hymnal took it's place above the keys
We'd take turns sitting by him he'd nod we'd turn the page

Well the old piano's silent now it don't ring with joy no more
Except sometimes when the cat jumps down when there's someone at the door
I can see him up in heaven with a smile upon his face
When God and all the angels let him lead Amazing Grace

Working on trucks for the local pit boss
Friday nights when he'd come to town
They'd all line up to see him lay some
Rubber down
Joey had a ute built in '74
With a 350 Chevy and 4 on the floor
Chrome wire wheels and customized back
He could run the main street ¼ mile in under 10 flat
Cause he's the king of the road out here
He's won four big Ford's and an old John Deer
He won the summer nationals twice
He's the king of the road out here on Friday nights
Was a summer's night and I remember it well
A city boy thought he had a story to tell
He had a turbo charged flash in the pan
He walked up to Joey and said hey
I hear you're the man
The whole town was there it was quite a scene
It was the biggest race there ever had been
That little car looked pretty in red

He loved the smell of gasoline
He could say Max Dumsdy
Before Dad and Mummy
He could even say Valvoline

He said don't worry mamma
I'll fix it up good

And pops second gear and makes the rubber peel

Chasin' roos and razorback
She's country

She'll look you in the eye
Work all day and dance all night
Drink the whole bar dry

Hot day's you can find her there
Lying by the lake and she don't care
Wearin' nothin' but her long dark hair
She's country

She's country certified
Country 'till the day she dies
She's country born and bred
She's country as it gets

Grew up fast in '89
Helped her Ma keep the farm alive
The year her Daddy died

Put a roof on the old hay shed
Fixed the truck when it blew a head
Hung in when she was over it
She's country

She was born out in the sticks
In the drought of '76
She'll never call it quits

Adam Brand,"When I was a baby my mum and my dad
Said slow down son you're crawling too fast
I had skinned up knees and bumps on my head
Well I couldn't talk then but if I could I'd have said

I was built for speed I was born to run
I get chills when they fire off that starter's gun
Keep your rocking chair and your tranquility
I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed

Well that car lot man said I've got a deal for you
It's got air con, cushy seats and rides real smooth
Well I told him I don't care if the saddle looks good
'Cause it's all about them horses underneath the hood

In a hundred years from now when my body gives out
I won't have no nursemaid wheeling me around
I'll take a chrome Harley motor and I'll bolt it to my chair
And I'll lay a strip of rubber up those pearly white stairs



",Built for Speed,2005
Adam Brand,"When 1914 began, he was working on the land with his mum and dad
He left behind his girl, joined up to see the world, it made his mother sad
And he made it through the war, and came back to town
To help his father work the fields and rebuild his life somehow
And everybody calls him the ANZAC and that's still what they call him now

He set his mind to stay when his father passed away and the rivers ran dry
He said ""I'll take care of you mum, I've fought before and won, we can win this fight""
And all alone he'd work all day until he'd drop, until the place got back to best he didn't stop
There were times he thought he'd been forgotten
But every night at six o'clock

Well they all stand for that man they called the ANZAC
Those who gave their lives for us
They'd stand for that man they called the ANZAC
For fighting for the land he loves

At the same time every year we all remember them
At the crack of dawn we stand as one for all our fallen friends
So we stand for that man we call the ANZAC
We will remember them

So stand for that man we call the ANZAC
For those who gave their lives for us
They stand for that man we call the ANZAC
For fighting for the land that he loves

Sometimes we're not making love at all
Sometimes when our hearts are breaking

There's so much that we don't understand
But we can bring the magic back again
Take a lesson from a little child
They can always find a smile

Sometimes life is what we make it
Sometimes we don't make it much at all
Sometimes it's so hard to take it

Adam Brand,"There's a scar on my right elbow
From a barbed wire fence when I was eight years old
I must have ran a mile just crying in my torn shirt
'Till I heard the words tell me where it hurts.

If there was a scratch or a bruise on my skin
Mama would put me back together again
All it took was her prayers and her kisses
It would heel me just like stitches.

I took Sherry Johnson to the high school dance
But she left early with my best friend
I must of drove ten miles to get my mind off her
But it didn't work 'till I heard the words tell me where it hurts

She could mend a broken heart, fix a bicycle wreck,
Funny now but back then it seemed life or death
I've seen her sew rags into riches
It would heel me just like stitches.

There was only one thing
That he'd think about all the time
With a scoop on the hood
And a thundering roar,
When you power shift overdrive
Up on the hill
With a head full of dreams,
""That'll be me one day""
When the chequered flag
Would bring 'em all home,
This is what the kid would say

Now he's 25 got his own car,
No. 1 painted on the side
He may be young and he may be small,
But you ought to see him drive
Tearing it up through Conrod straight,
Tyres chirpin' every gear,
If you listen close
To what the kid's got to say,
This is what you're gonna hear

Now I've got my wheels watch me drive right by, You can eat my dust and try to keep up
Man I'd like to see you try, I'll have my pedal
To the metal my claw to the floor
And I'm always out sight, Now I got my wheels
And I won't even wave goodbye

Or kissing all that much
They must have loved each other

Mama held the fort down
Dad he went to work
We never thought about what she meant to him
Or what he meant to her
Sometimes on a Saturday
They'd crank up that stereo
Grab a stack of old 45 records
We'd watch 'em put on a show

When the needle, hit the vinyl
Mama's hair came down
Dad he came unwound
In their own world
Just a boy and girl
We couldn't believe our eyes
How they came alive
When the needle hit the vinyl

Six kids on a worn out couch
We didn't say a word
Dad would put on ""My Girl""
And sing it right to her
Mama she was glowing
Dad he made the perfect moves
Neither one of them seemed like
The mum and dad we knew
They both looked younger
As they went round and around
Under the spell of that popping cracking sound
Then something happened
When they danced to the slow ones
They got this funny look then said
""Okay kids it's time for bed""

Pulled out on the 18th hole
Slow danced on the green grass

Closed her eyes and held me tight
Felt the wheels spinning in my mind

Booth in the back, they sat alone
Holding hands like two young lovers

She said to him
""I'm getting older
A pretty girl, no more to be
Heaven knows
I'm not a treasure""
He softly said ""You are to me""

""You are to me a girl in spring time
The one I met so long ago
A moment captured for a lifetime
That's what I see you are to me""

Two kids with the grown up dream
Of a perfect love 
Foolin' round in my first car
Careful not to go too far
That's how it was.

We had a simple wedding
You looked beautiful in white
And I recall your mother's blessing
On our wedding night.
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.

We moved into a commission house
It wasn't much and it wasn't ours
But we had plans
I worked nights and you worked days
And twelve months seemed to slip away
Like an avalanche

I came home one morning
Found your note pinned to the door
Saying if this is a perfect love
I don't want it any more
But I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.

I was back in town just passing through
Catching up with friends we knew for old times sake 
In a crowded lunch time bar
I turn around and there you are
Face to face

And for the sweetest moment
A smile came to your eyes
So I whispered as you walked away
With the new man at your side
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best

There was a wall you had to find

Sometimes it hurts more then it seems

I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the mothafucker standing in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away!

Yeah, six foot deep, deep deep in the cut
Shovel and a tarp rolled up in the truck
Couple old bikers and they know what's up
Spin my iTunes, shake 'em, I'm getting people roughed up
And a child molester might end up in the mud
Bones in the shit of a couple wild boars
Teeth buried in the lot of a little white church
I be somewhere dog GPS don’t work
Where the cops all do things a little bit dirty
But they stay on my team, I got that baby face money
Y’all can buy all that jewelry, I’ll invest in my community
Put a bucket in the ground, fill it up with plenty shiny things
I got brass for days, pitbulls with teeth so razor sharp you’d think
My females slept with a great white shark
I ain’t tryna brag but my A-Team too big
Some crazy motherfuckers on that 1900’s shit

I don’t think you wanna go that route

Get the point bitch, when I hit you with the hollow round
What the fuck you talkin' 'bout
I don’t wanna talk about it
Leave your body right there layin' with some chalk around it

Adam Cohen,"Some people fall in love
I've just been round the edges
I'm still not really sure
About what it is or how to get it
Is love by chance or by seduction
All that I have are vague assumptions

Of what love must be like
What love must feel like
Tell me what does it look like
Is it as beautiful as you are

I've never been in love
Does that surprise you
I find myself alone
In times when I don't want to be alone
It's not that I am scared of going too deep
It's just that I'm no good at pretending
Starting or ending
Causually I'm imagining

Of what love must be like

Adam Cohen,"Something went wrong
You are not laughing
It's not so easy now to get your smile
You gotta be wrong
To walk these streets
And keep from falling
But when you're not, just let yourself cry

You've been working hard
Just trying to pay the rent
Tryin' to draw the line between who you are
And who you invent
But if you throw a stone
Something's gonna shatter somewhere
We're all so fragile
We're all so scared

You say you want to learn how to live your life
Without tears
But we've been trying to do that for thousands of years
So go on and cry Ophelia
It's the only thing to do sometimes
You know I'm crying too
Right there with you
It's alright Ophelia
Everybody cries

Thank god for my bad memory
I've forgotten some of the stupid things
That I've done
I've come to a little wisdom
Through a whole lot of failure
So I watch more carefully what rolls off my tongue

You pray for rain
But you don't want it from a storm
You find a rose
And cut your finger on a thorn

It's the only thing to do sometimes
You know I'm crying too
Right there with you
It's alright Ophelia
Everybody cries Ophelia",Cry Ophelia,1998

You don't have to be the one
To tell me that I'm outta line

One more broken glass

An ordinary miracle

I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
what will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.

And they cut off your welfare check

Everybody wants a fly car, nice crib and all tha ice
When they see me in the street, they want to call the vice
Get on some landlord shit and turn out all the lights
I'm like the toll that you should've paid
You said you had the Mac, why you should of spree'd!
What happened to the chicks and the chips you bragged about?
What happened to the guns and the clips you bragged about?
I heard about they stomped you, and beat you, and dragged you out
You said they heard they got me, and that I doubt!
Street smarts and most y'all punks ya need heart
My peoples get busy for real soon as the beef starts
want to learn some more about me
Your sure to see I'm a stand up guy wit maturity
And during this speech I'm always willin' reach
I love my peeps that are still in the streets.

Ya still my man aiight, see money changes many things
You go from just gettn' by to shopping spree's buying everything
The guard came up hard straight out the boulevard
I pull your card get in your skin like a bullet scar
I'm holding the weight controlling your fate
'cause you didn't play the game by the rules ya know its too late
You tried to hop the fence on false pretence that's nonsense
You know we cut off our weak links

Everybody wants to be the boss
Everybody wants the spotlight but don't want to pay the cost
Me I give a kid direction if he says he's lost,
Some suckers want attention That's why they love to floss
But me I don't care about that there
You say you from the hood, you can't go back there
The same crooks you see coming up you'll see going down
Take that look off your face you know what's going down
We about to strip you of ya stripes you little ass wipe
About to take over your spot uh huh that's right!
Ya more bogus than a three dollar bill
Pop ya crisp rock ya wrists yeah y'all is mad ill

Adam Faith,"My life goes on in endless song
Above earth's lamentations,
I hear the real, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation.

Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear it's music ringing,
It sounds an echo in my soul.
How can I keep from singing?

While though the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it liveth.
And though the darkness 'round me close,
Songs in the night it giveth.

No storm can shake my inmost calm,
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing? 
When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging,
When friends by shame are undefiled
How can I keep from singing?

There's a minstrel parade on tv
Let the lights glow, an excellent reason
To stay home tonight

Oh the old men wave their canes
They have yesterday's brains
And their worlds stop turning on sundays
The young lives are clipped 
And smudged on the rocks
Distorted and forgotten

Quietly she enters the room
But we can't talk, we can not be seen
Returning her new pair of jeans
Just to stay home tonight

Oh the mirror always shows
There's a stranger in my clothes
Standing on the third rail
Lost at sea 
Searching for me
And we don't know how to sail

So if you go to guitar store
You will see me again
Holding the door
It's an excellent night to sleep on the floor
If you stay home tonight

In a fence where a goat was alone by himself

A boy who built a snowman out of himself

I've been spotted in pictures with Navy recruits
Look at your costume you know that it's true
Any one could pop in as you

Try to untie your lips but they were double knotted
I tried to break into you brain but all the entrances were rotted
If the moon had minute hands it would have meant a lot
But God would have made the moon as a clock.

When the boy's little waves pass you by
Oh never to be there again
Oh the children where so old-fashioned then

Coffins decked out on the street
Who's the stranger with the purple feet
Don't I remember him from somewhere
Before his feet lost his hair

But if everyone is coffin-bound

I'm so scared to never make a sound
I'm so scared of being underground

With arrows pointing at her face

Cast a shadow in my direction

Bring back shadows over here
Bring back shadows of your face
We'll make shadow plays
We'll dig shallow graves
In my shady, shadow cave

Shadow grows longer in my twilight sleep
I stop then to remember I'm just counting sheep

Cast a shadow in my direction
Cast a shadow in my direction
Cast a shadow in my direction

Adam Green,"There's a time that will come 
When the kitchen is sunny and 
There's just no other place I like to be

And everything's gone 
And my finger is longer
And I never want to come down again

I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely
I got cold last night on a West-bound train

I love the moonlight
That combs the praires
I got cold last night on a box car floor

Oh my baby couldn't shame me that day
When my lady threw my drugs away
Hey, I almost thought she'd need me to know
I like drugs
I love them so

I like drugs
I like to linger in the alleyway
I like drugs
I like to hold them for a friend
And everything's gone
And my finger is longer
I never want to come down again

I like to do drugs
I like to have drugs
I like to hold a cigarette full of grass in my hand
Until one morning
That ugly morning
When the brat got stabbed and the cat got drunk

Oh my baby couldn't shame me that day
When my lady threw my drugs away 
Hey, I almost thought she'd need me to know
I like drugs
I love them so

I like drugs",Drugs,2006
Adam Green,"Can I trust this hairy woman
To hide out when I'm embarassed
So embarassed by injustice that shuts doors on hairy women

There's no place inside this romance
For a girl that's clearly balding
So embarassed by injustice that shuts doors on balding women

We despise the narrow souls we tend
The bowls of bones that skulls descend
The shallow pools of lust
That drown our tallest women

Though this is a place of business
Where they pay with mumbo-jumbo
I have praise for every fantasy that braves a hairy nipple

We despise the narrow souls we found
That haunt us fifteen years from now
They just have no remorse
They shut their doors on women
I'm so embarassed",Hairy Women,2006
Adam Green,"How can I continue to survive
When the soda pop is dropping all the time
And the gravity is project behind a whore?
Listen up because your daddy is a bore

And who can fly a rocket to the moon
When the two of us be dropping our tune
And he slipped between the shadow of the day?
I dunno because I wanna make you pay

Hey dude

Do you wanna go the wrong way?
Heart-breakers in the Motown shakers
And the fakers in the town, baby
White women and they don't stop swimming
I got a finger in the town, baby
Hey, hey, hey

Bob Dylan was a vegetable's wife
Game over, hope you had a good life
Hey dude, hey dude
Sock it to me, baby

Do you wanna go the wrong way?
I'll take you for a ride
Watching now, I love you all the time
Careful what you do about the wild, wild women
And all the fingers in the town, baby
And all the fingers in the town
And all the fingers in the town",Hey Dude,2006
Adam Green,"Leave me alone 
I'm in control 
Gonna have a bad time 
Rocking at the Hollywood Bowl 

Blow, daddy, blow 
Cause me to weep 
Cry, baby, cry 
All around the breeding ground muscular dudes 

Pass me by 
Slap me bye bye 

And I don't even have to go 
Up in a deconstructed badman 
Raging river flow 

Melanie asked you for permission to weep, report two more 
I'm made a fool 
Next time a cool joke 
But I can not go back to that town 
They make fun of me too much 
And I can not go back to that town 
Like my brother said before he died 
One breaking down 

Leave me alone 
Nobody home 
You've a new brand blue magic cold wedding gown 

Not much to say 
Cry, baby, cry 
But I can not go back to Shanghai",Hollywood Bowl,2006
