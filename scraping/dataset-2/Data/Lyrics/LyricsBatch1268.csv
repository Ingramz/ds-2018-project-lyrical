Wheatus,"Socrates ain?t got nothing on me when it comes to overthinking
Paranoid that?s how I prefer to be into the ground I?m sinking
Then you call
And you say
To me in your ordinary way
That you can?t
Help me out
Of the ordinary

[Chorus:]
You?re just like the London Sun man you?re over and done with before you?ve begun
And I won?t
Be like the only one who would stand there and smile and try to be fun
When I say
Hey baby what went wrong we go back to beginnings the story?s too long
To be told
Like you were the only one who ever got left in the dark by the London Sun

Hurricanes are blowing out my brains but my eyes are calm and hollow
Airplane stalls from the sky it falls you can read the news tomorrow
Then you call
And you say
To me in your ordinary way
That your life
Has become
Too fucking ordinary

[Chorus]

If you wanna leave
It?s alright
I know what it?s like
To feel like
Life is passing by
When you are stuck in the place you're in
Ordinary space you're in
I?m stuck at a nook in the place that I?m stuck in with you

Chorus (2x)

Wheatus,"When the summer comes we'll get on our aeroplanes and go back to where we came from. 
Summertime 
It's a surprise. But I think I'll survive. 
When this is done we can have our loved ones back just in time the the new hijack. 
Blue and black 
It's a fact. It's the act we act in side. 

Oh god how good would it be if you trusted me and I believed in you? 
Oh god what good could we do? No happy ending tune. 
When the summer comes we can burn our penguin clothes and go home 
Where no one knows us. 
Sunnyside 
It's a sign, shinny like a dime. 

When this is done we can die a thousand times all alone and unrecognized. 
Summertime 
Never mind. Oh I hate to say good bye. 
But oh god how good would it be if you trusted me and I believed in you?
Oh god what good would it do?
If I believed in you.
If I believed in you.
But this is a no happy ending tune. 

Oh god how good would it be if you trusted me and I believed in you? 
Oh god what good could we do?
If you trusted me and I believed in you.
Oh god what good would it do?
If I believed in you.
If I believed in you. If I believed in you.
If I believed in you.
If I believed in you. If I believed in you. 

But this is a no happy ending tune",No Happy Ending Tune,2005
Wheatus,"Cocaine eyes,
Been living a lie
Looks like another big night on the credit card, baby
But you're makin' 'em smile
Yeah you're drivin' 'em wild
I could sit back and let you do all the talking now
Couldn't I?

I'm dropping round
Just you pretend that you don't hear me though
And I could be just what you need and you would never know
Your way to busy playing DJ on the stereo
But you don't spin it like I feel it though

The center of my mind is a dark place that wishes it wouldn't do what it would
(Do what it would)
And every mistake that I ever made saying I didn't do what I should
(Do what he should)
And if you wanna see me smilin' you're gonna have to
(Do something you never)
(Do something you never)
You never would

The bigger the size
The better the prize
Gonna get yourself a big bad life you's a cool kid ain't cha?

But you still got the style
That makes the company smile
You just sit back and let em do all the talking now
Don't ya?

You and your crew can shovel shit down at the money show
Sign for your life and they will get you on the radio.
Check out the line around the block and say I told you so
But you don't play it like I feel it, no

The center of my mind is a dark place that wishes it wouldn't do what it would
(Do what it would)
And every mistake that I ever made, saying I didn't do what I should

And if you wanna see me smiling you're gonna have to

Play something good.

Wheatus,"I met the King of England once
But the guys at the deli back home
They don't believe me
I ride my bike all around
Round my hometown
Where nobody knows me

And they say that the problem is mine and I should take
Take a more positive line on the situation
When solutions are staring me right in the face
Yet we've run out of time
But if I do what you'd say everything would be fine

Well no thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island
Cash it in and stick to the end
No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island
Can't you see than I need this to end

I had a dream about a song
It was so strong
It made all the rights wrong
But when I went to write it all down
Capture the sound
You won't believe what I found

Yeah it all came out bad, mad and sad when I played it
It sounded like, more like a fad that had lasted
A little too long that it had and I realised
That this was as good as it got
There's no snowmen in hell 'cause it's too fuckin' hot

So no thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island
Cash it in and stick to the end
No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island
Can't you see than I need this to end

Yeah I thought that I knew who I was
What did I know?
Nothing, or all the above did I mention
Those hip new ideas that I got from you last week
They sucked all the life out of life in a heartbeat
And ripped mine right out of my chest

Right through
But you already knew that was true
Since you tried it the first time, in 1989
When you were the one in my shoes
And some asshole like you told you what you should do
When you do what you do
And you had to do it how he wanted you to
Have you learned how to live with regret
Yeah I can't get these things in my head
'cause if I turned out like you I would wish I was dead
No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island",This Island,2005
Wheatus,"You don't have to tell me that I'm stubborn
'Cause I'm not
And I know ?cause it runs in my family
It skips every other generation
You don't have to save my soul
Or make me feel like I'm in control
It's not worth the double scotch whiskey
That you'd have to buy me

You look like your surprised
Like when will I get wise
But I'll just drive them same dead ends I've tried
And I think I know why

[Chorus:]
There's no connection between what I want
And what is good for me
The truth I tell myself not to believe

You don't know I could have been some thin'
But I'm not and I know that it's somebody else's fault
Just like every other thing that's ever happened to me
Yeah I could have been like the king
Or like someone who could really sing
Folks would line up round the corner just so they could come n' hear me

There I go again
Them devils love their sin
Well they can't end what I do not begin
So I'm safe where I'm in

[Chorus]

There's no direction between where I am
And where I'm supposed to be
The truth I tell myself not to believe

Don't think that I'm expecting you to stay
'Cause you won't and I know 'cause I've seen it a million times
It's my charming self destructive disposition of I
Yeah all happy endings are for fools
Who feel like they will never loose
Folks, who think there's a God out there then that's gonna save them

I'll get this round my friend
And then we can start again
Just like we did when we were who we are
Have we come that far?

[Chorus]

There's no direction between where I am
And where I'm supposed to be
The truth I tell myself not to believe",The Truth I Tell Myself,2005

Emptiness with no apparent cause

Trying not to think
So afraid, would I brake?
Invisible for those I love

It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone

Seventeen years, we were childish playing
We had time to make good nights
We push back all our problems daily
Polaroid shots in the mountains, baby
We had time to make good nights

And we were high
We had radio love
We said we'd never ever, ever let it go, no
In our mirage
We were perfect as fuck
Making dreams about our lives up in the stars
Yeah yeah babe
Yeah yeah babe

And don't you ever go, don't you ever go, darling
'Cause you're all that I know, you're all that I know
Why did you change your mind and end the night?
And now I'm on my own, now I'm on my own
Maybe I'll call you on the phone, call you on the phone
Or maybe I just won't call 'cause I'm alright
Yeah yeah babe

Someday I'll be patient, baby
Maybe our minds wouldn't be that hazy
We'd have time to make good nights
Look back through our rearview mirror
Saturday lights couldn't get much clearer
We'd have time to make good nights

And we were high
We had radio love
Said we never ever, ever let it go, no
In our mirage
We were perfect as fuck
Faking dreams about our lives up in the stars

I fed them bread and I fed them rice
I tried to take refuge
They hungered still on my window sill
And they sang all night

Seemed I alone kept them alive
My charities they seemed endless
Feeding time those crows
Would form a single line

To appease them at a higher price
I laid myself outside
Those crows aimed down and fearful
I just closed mine eyes

My sight was not returned to me
Yet every crow remained
They light my way with that song
They sing like friends of mine

And gave them every one a name

Whippersnapper,"Somewhere between a lie and truth
Lies a subtle line of gray and
Although it's undetectable
It's reflected in all we say

We don't want to hate or judge each other
We just want to live our lives
To save ourselves, we must seek the truth
And recognize these rites

I have my motivation, prejudice and pain
I will not live my life, live my life in vain
I have my motivation, prejudice and pain
No, I will not live my life, live my life in vain

This more-than-human condition
A denial of our flaws
We want the effects of perfection
But disregard the cause

A simple mistaken judgment
An unmistakable fact of life
We want to say we can do no wrong
But wrong's what defines right

In a perfect world, in a perfect world
In a perfect world that I can't live
In a perfect world, in a perfect world
In a perfect world that I can't live

In a perfect world, in a perfect world
In a perfect world that I can't live

We're fallible, we're so fragile
We suffer for our sins
We have to learn to learn from our mistakes
And somehow make amends

Stress and instability
Depression and dismay
We want to live without regrets
But there is no other way
You can't have it, you can't have it all

When there's nothing to believe in, there nobody listening?

We've seen it all before and the boy who lives next door
Who gains your trust and has his way
And all the bruises heal, but not the shame
Inflicted by this viciousness and everyone's to blame

It's a known injustice, it's a silent crime
That everyone pretends that they can't see
She already locked away the memories inside
And lives in a prison while he walks free

What kind of world have we become
Has everybody lost control?
Was there ever a time when anyone could feel safe
Wherever they go

Instead of living in fear suspecting everyone
Nobody wants to get involved
Sit and watch your neighbors die
Do you think that you're absolved?

It's a known injustice, it's a silent crime
That everyone pretends that they can't see
She already locked away the memories inside

I know you knew that it would never last
Felt like some thing's taken from you

Now I've grown so cold and bitter

I pray I wouldn't feel like I am
Somehow better off alone

It's not enough to make me change my mind
It's hard enough to live
With so much left inside

I try to live my life
And take it step by step and day by day
Throw off these chains of instability
And find the light to lead my way

Each bridge has its toll
I swore to God, I had more strength than that
But I'm not too strong to lose control

The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots
Mr. Grinch!
Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch!
With a nauseous super naus!
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss
Mr. Grinch!
You're a three-decker sauerkraut 
And toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch",1995

He cut his teeth on his daddy?s guitar
He lived every line that he's ever sung
He made believers to all that said it couldn't be done

He worked on his chops eight hours a day
While learning the ropes and climbing the ranks
He kicked and he scratched to get his shot
And he never kissed ass on his way to the top

He says hey man, here I am
Rocking the stage and shaking the stands
With the punch of the drums, the blast of the amps
A sold out show every time I jam

Hey man, here I am
Living the life with the world in my hands
A rush from the crowd, the roar of the fans
When the lights come up he feels like the champ
He feels like the champ

He says there's always a new kid coming to town
Looking for ways to try and knock him down
They got hungry eyes and a passion that burns
Chomping at the bit to get their turn

He seen a thousand faces come and go
But he's still here, nobody steels his show
With a bottle a gin and a Martin guitar
Man, the world's never seen a bigger star

He says hey man, here I am

With the punch of the drums, the blast of the amps

And when the lights come up, he feels like the champ
He feels like the champ

He steps under the lights at Broadway and Main
Takes a pull from the bottle to warm up and sing
He's got dirt on his face, an open case at his feet
As the people toss change passing 'round the street

He sleeps under the bridge in a cardboard box
But when the stars come out he's ready to rock

He says hey man, here I am
Rocking the stage and shaking the stands
With the punch of the drums, the blast of the amps
A sold out show every time I jam

Saw her waiting tables in a Beale Street Blues Café
The band was playing strong but she was center stage

Straight from the delta, off to see the world
This was the big time for a Mississippi girl
Had a hard life 'cause she's a southern pearl

Something about her took my breath away
Her love, it hit me like a hurricane

And she's like joyriding in a '57 coupé
She's like two-stepping in my favorite pair of boots
She's like skydiving without a parachute
And girl, I'm falling, I'm falling into you

We got to dancing, drinking all night long
She said, ?don't quit on me now, boy, won't you come along?
And we went down by the river, skinny dipping till the dawn

Spent the morning fishing, fried 'em up by noon
Spent the evening kissing near the southern moon

And she's like joyriding in a '57 coupé

I was sittin' around pickin', just my pops and me
When his friend walked up in a cowboy hat
Said ""I like what your doin', but it ain't worth sap
I see this road will leave you cold and alone
Old and broke and just a bag of bones
So you better take heed to the words I say
Stay quite clear of that lost highway""

O southern wind, won't you take me high?
I got seven ladies dancin' naked by an old camp fire
Guitars pickin' with a bottle of wine
And I'll be an old broke guitar picker, lord, when I die

Holes in my clothes, I got holes in my shoes
I got a hole in the heart, that's why I'm singin' the blues
I put some change in my pocket but it's all gone
And everything that I do it seems to be wrong
So now I'm broke I'm back on the street
With a guitar case in front of Tate and me
And you better listen up 'cause it ain't no lie
Please throw a nickel in when you walk by

I came in this world with nothin' on my back
And I'll leave the same and that's a fact
I ain't in it for the money, I ain't in it for the fame
And I don't really care if you remember my name

""Son, you better get them crops in when it turns cool."" 
In the magazines, I saw the naked women 
I heard about the drinkin' and the bars 
If my daddy could've caught me, he'd a-killed me 
He said, ""You might run, boy, but you ain't gonna get far."" 
I hit town or you might say that it hit me 
Next mornin' there were things I knew more about 
The woman who had taken me in said, ""Country boy, you're all right."" 
The same way I turned her on, she turned me out 
The first law I broke, right away they got me 
I helped them build the country roads for awhile 
They fed me two times a day and knocked me down about four 
For thirty days I didn't even crack a smile 
I met a nice girl and she said I was her baby 
She let me go and would never tell me why 
I learned what it means to be somebody's baby 
They let you lie in your bed by yourself and cry 
The miles were good but the mileage is turnin' my hair gray 
I've met some people that knew me and call me friend 
Ain't no sense in wantin' my life to live over 
I'd find different ways to make those mistakes again 
So let me say this, I never tried to hurt anybody 
Though I guess there's a few that I still couldn't look in the eye

Whisperin' Bill Anderson,"I said a bad word when I was a kid
Mama said that I'd be sorry for the sin that I did
My daddy whooped me and the preacher said shame
And I tried like hell to change

I cuss, I smoke
I laugh at dirty jokes
Minor vices man I know 'em well
I've closed down bars
And I've busted in my heart
My exes think I oughta burn in hell
But the devil, he won't notice when I die
Don't you figure
He's got bigger fish to fry
Oh yeah

Politicians taking corporate bribes
Crooked CEOs are getting off with no time
Christmas eve burglars stealin' good children's toys

The minor vices, man I know I'm well
I've closed down bars
I've busted in my heart
My exes thinks that I oughta burn in hell
But the devil wont even notice when I die
Ya don't you figure
Hes got bigger fish to fry

There's gonna be a bonfire burnin'
An everlastin' barbeque
But with all the bad stuff goin' on
There ain't gonna be room for me and you

'Cause we cuss and we smoke
We laugh at Taylor's jokes

'honey lets run upstairs and make love' and your answer is I cannot do both)

Does your mother know you're out Cecilia?
Does she know that I'm about to steal you?

Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?
Oh Cecilia
Say that you'll be mine

Many funny things occur
While the boys are courting her
I refer to one case in particular
She went with a boy named Joe
Who was always lisping so
When he'd ask this miss
For a little kiss it would sound just like this

Doeth your mother know you're out The-thiel-yuh
Doeth thee know that I'm about to thteal ""yuh""

I'd go far before I'd find a sweeter pan

You have the softest bed
You need it's familiarity
It's very nice. You like the warmth.
You've been in other beds before,
But disregard their similarity
You may be bored
The only flaw
As far as you can see

And when that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness
When that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness

You drift away, well no one said
That you should look ahead
You're not supposed to lie there all day long
It's a love that you maintain
There's none of it in vain
These easy sacrifices are not wrong
Though they're ignored,
You're forgotten
But you're not gone

And when that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness

It's almost as good as happiness

And you can love no one,

Or watch the world go by 
To pass the time that passes anyway.

Sounds so strange when you use my name
You ask me questions with no replies
There's an emotion there I can't quite find
I say I'm leaving, You look surprised
In the dark still after last night

So I disappear into the city streets,
With all the other armour plated personalities,
While you hide under the crumpled sheets
And that's all there is to you and me.

Coincidences aren't hard to find,
If you're looking for some kind of sign
But it's not always two souls entwined
Seems we both just forgot our lines
If you feel rejected or compromised you won't express it, no long goodbyes

So I disappear into the city streets.
I look lovely in the morning apparently
But it's a game of bluff and double bluff I see
And that's all there is to you and me

Watching the world so small below
I love the dreaming when I think of
The safety in the clouds out my window

I wonder what keeps us so high up
Could there be a love beneath these wings?
If we suddenly fall should I scream out
Or keep very quite and cling to my mouth?

As I'm crying, so frightened of dying
Relax, yes, I'm trying
This fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me

I love the quite of the night time
When the sun is drowning in the deathly sea
I can feel my heart beating as I speed from
The sense of time catching up with me

The sky set out like a pathway
But who decides which route we take
As people drift into a dream world
I close my eyes as my hands shake

And when I see a new day
Who's driving this anyway
I picture my own grave 'cause fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me

Floating neither up or down
I wonder when I'll hit the ground
Well, the earth beneath my body shake
And cast your sleeping hearts awake

Could it tremble stars from moon light skies?
Could it drag a tear from your cold eyes?
I live on the right side, I sleep in the left
That's why everything's gotta be love or death

You're feeling so numb, you're coming undone

You know there's gonna come a day when you will know

Stop wasting time on a four leaf clover

The ceiling shakes when he makes his way down the stairs
The lights go out, put a finger to your mouth
There is nothing we can get away within this house

Would be so hard
Would break your heart
Would waste your time
I know it?s a diamond mine
All our friends are doing fine

And there is a dinner party right across the hall
And I hear neighbors laughing through the kitchen wall
And I hear the sound of a plate crash to the ground
When I turn the table on its side, it'll shake the house

Would be so hard
Would break your heart
Would waste your time
I know it?s a diamond mine

Tearing apart all the drapes
Turning them all into gowns for their parade

And I want you to know, while you're singing out of tune
I'll be in the back, making eyes across the room

I could be out on the tiles all night
So put my name on your dance card
And usher me out to the yard where the band plays

Hanging on the hall wall
We watch them 'cross the desert
From an armchair in the hall

We saw the world from the edge of our seat
Dance with the harem and drank with sheet
The man on the back of the camels were following me

And we make ourselves a home
At the foot of the steps
Blankets and old wooden chairs
And we stayed there
We laid there, room go smaller
We beg for water but went for air

So we ran away from our old brittle home
We thought it was sand
And the lamp was the sun
So let's get outside
?Cause we've been inside for too long

And we take a drive
And the buildings all turn into trees
And after a while
We find ourselves down by the sea

The beach was a dessert
Outside in an old magazine
The sheiks and the harem
Were under the waves
The camels they all wash away

And no one is happier
And nothing is free
So I think to myself
We should go and get us a drink

Raise the flag of faith up high
Let the doubters call it what they may

But I believe in better dreams
They may call it slavery
But the biggest chain I knew was me

The walls of lies crumble to the ground
I know where salvation can be found

Out of the depths of a trembling heart

And shatter the blackness and pain
Let it rise like a healing flame

In the in back of el Ranchero
Collecting all the scraps
A coaster with a number and a dented baseball bat
Dialed unfamiliar digits

As city made of tin cans
And another made of gold

For a place to call home

All I want to do is talk 
About my love, woman I love 
I never, I could be this way 
When I hold you in my arms 
I know that's where I want to stay 

This is the place I should be 
Spreading the harmony my love

And the words seem to fade 
I don't ever, ever have to world (?)

I turn to greet the dawn
Knowing I must face another day
Sleepless night behind me
Just a memory of pain
My heart has always been a cross to bear

Lord, I know the sunshine
But I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today

All around me shadows fall
Though day has just begun
I realize I'm on my own again
Memories of broken dreams
As distant as the sun
Are drifting like an echo in the wind

Lord, I know the sunshine
But I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today

Babe, I thought about it
But it just ain't done good
You hold my heart and soul within your hand
All the time, you're in my mind
I never thought you could be so blind
Maybe someday I will understand

Lord, I know the sunshine
But I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today, no more

Hey, mama, you drive me crazy
Knowing you're my heart's desire
Why'd you go and hang me up this way?
You've given me love, given me love
Now tell me what you were thinking of
Why'd you go and steal my soul away?

Falling down to wash my sins away

When he's burning with the fever
A stray dog howls
When he's lonely in the night
A woman goes crazy
With the though of retribution
But, a man starts weeping
When he's sick and tired of life 

I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow
Feel I'm wasting my time
Lighting candles in the wind,
Always taking my chances
On the promise of the future
But, a heart full of sorrow
Paints a lonely tapestry 

The sun is shining
But, it's raining in my heart 

No one understands the heartache,
No one feels the pain,
Cause no one ever sees the tears
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain,
Crying in the rain

I can never deny
All the sweet things I have tasted
Tho' I've been mistreated
I keep coming back for more,
I know where I'm going
There's no hope of absolution
I can't seem to separate
The good times from the bad 

The sun is shining
But, it's raining in my heart 

No one understands the heartache,
No one feels the pain,
Cause no one ever sees the tears
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain 

The sun is shining
But, it's raining in my heart 

No one understands the heartache,
No one feels the pain,
Cause no one ever sees the tears
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain,
When you're crying in the rain 

Crying in the rain",Crying in the Rain,1987
Whitesnake,"You say your dreams are burned to ashes
And your smiles have turned to tears,
It seems to me you welcome sanest
As you surrender to your fears

So what's a man like me supposed to do
When all I want is just to make love to you

Don't turn away, before the night is over
Don't turn away, before the night is gone
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer
So don't turn away, before the night,
Before the night is gone

You say your heart is lost forever
And you're always gonna give your love in vain
So you paint yourself a lonely portrait
And hide your love away again

You turn away from what you feel inside,
You can't forget all your foolish pride

Don't turn away, before the night is over
Don't turn away, before the night is gone
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer
So don't turn away, before the night is gone

So now I'm asking you this question
Am I gonna give you all my love in vain
Do you want to drown in your own sorrow
Or are you gonna try to love again

Don't turn away from what you feel inside,
You should try to forget about all your foolish pride

Don't turn away, before the night is over
Don't turn away, before the night is gone
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer
So don't turn away, before the night,
Before the night,
Before the night is gone 

Don't turn away from me baby,
No, no, no, no.
Don't put me away,
Don't walk away from me darling
I need your love,
Oh baby,
I need your love to rescue me,
An' I'm coming for you, baby",Don't Turn Away,1987
Whitesnake,"When I first saw you baby
You took my breath away
I knew your name was trouble
But, my heart got in the way
I couldn't stop myself from reaching out
I could not turn away

I don't even know your name
An' I can't leave you alone
I'm running round in circles
Like a dog without a bone
I know the game you're playing
But, baby I just can't let go

So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your loving tonight

I'll work hard everyday
To love and treat you right
I'll rock you in the morning
And roll you in the night
Any way you want
I'm gonna prove my love for you.

So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your loving tonight, tonight, tonight

Just give me all of your loving tonight, aww

I am blinded by your smile
And I'm crazy about your walk
I shiver and I shake

I'm a fool for your loving babe
Give me all your love tonight

So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want

An' closing my eyes
I'm asking myself
Why is it all my horizons
Are so far away

I look in the mirror
Don't like what I see
In my reflection

Looking for love

The love of a woman
The needs of a man
I try so hard to believe
But I don't understand
The search goes on

But over the mountains
Across the sea
I know love is waiting
I hear it calling to me
Calling my name

I'm looking for love all around me
Looking for love to surround me
The love that I need
To rescue the state of my heart, yeah

Alone again, it's always the same
I've just been marking my time
Since the day I was born
With no one to blame

The candle is burning
It's way down low
I just need someone
To show me the way, the way to go
Which way to go

Whitesnake,"The night is gone
The time has come
To find a new day has begun
An' it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
An' kiss away the bitter tears
A love to light the way

And from the darkness
Comes a smile
That reaches out for many miles
Touching everyone
No more shadows of the past
Your spirit free to fly at last
Shining in the sun

Like the rolling thunder
I feel the power of love
It's a gift from heaven
And the Lord above

We walk toward desire
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

Take it easy, take it slow
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
Places never seen before
'Cause I love you, an' I need you
I'll do my best to please you
My love can open any door

When you hear the thunder
In your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you
When the lightning strikes

So don't you worry,
You can ease your mind
'Cause we'll be dancing
At the end of time

Who loves you, who needs you
Who'll do his best to please you
I love you, I need you
I'll get down on my knees

We walk toward desire
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day

On the road to Judgment Day
Who loves you, who needs you
On the road to Judgment Day

Whitesnake,"When I look back
On everything I've done
I know you must have cried river of tears,
But, you were there
When I was feeling low
To walk me through my darkest fears

So when the sun goes down
An' those nights grow colder,
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder

An' the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion,
An' the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

There were times
I almost let you go
When I thought I needed to break free,
But you were there
To whisper in my ear
Why don't you share my dreams with me

So when the sun goes down
An those nights are growing colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder

An' the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion,
An' the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

I don't mind, what you're doing to me,
I don't mind, 'cause you're all I can see
I don't mind, baby, you mean the world to me

When the sun goes down
An' those nights are growing colder,
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder, baby, baby, baby

So When the sun goes down
An' those nights are growing colder,
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder

'Cause the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion,
An' the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

Left out in the cold

Just what it means to lose control

But I took all the heartache
And turned it to shame
Now I'm moving moving on
And I ain't taking the blame

Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man

So I can say it to you babe
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
A fool for your loving no more
I'm so tired of trying I always end up crying
Fool for your loving no more

Whitesnake,"The night is gone,
The time has come
To find a new day has begun,
An' it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
An' kiss away the bitter tears
A love to light the way

And from the darkness
Comes a smile,
That reaches out for many miles,
Touching everyone.
No more shadows of the past,
Your spirit free to fly at last,
Shining in the sun

Like the rolling thunder,
I feel the power of love,
It's a gift from heaven
And the Lord above

We walk toward desire,
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgement Day

Take it easy, take it slow,
I'll take you anywhere you want to go,
Places never seen before
'Cause I love you, an' I need you,
I'll do my best to please you,
My love can open any door

When you hear the thunder
In your darkest night,
I'll be there to hold you
When the lightning strikes

So don't you worry,
You can ease your mind
'Cause we'll be dancing
At the end of time

Who loves you, who needs you,
Who'll do his best to please you,
I love you, I need you
I'll get down on my knees

We walk toward desire,
Hand and hand
Through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgement Day

So don't you worry, baby
On the road to Judgement Day
Who loves you, who needs you

The blues ain't bad,
But, I've never know anything
Make me feel so sad
Running on empty, hurting to the core,
When everything don't mean nothing any more

Every little thing looks fine,
But, the closer you get
You see the make up,
Cracked and lined
Somewhere there's a rainbow
With a pot of gold,

It's been taken and sold

Though cut down by life's deceptions

Don't fade away. 

Heaven help a man
Trying to make up his mind,
With the darkness closing in,
I feel I'm running out of time
Shine a light for me,
Help me find the way to go,
And take me where I've never been before

And so I stand at the crossroad,
Watching the sun sinking low
With my cross of indecision,
Trying to find the way to go

All in all it's been a rocky road,
Twists and turns along the way,
But, I still pray for tomorrow
All my hopes, my dreams
Don't fade away",Don't Fade Away,1998
Whitesnake,"I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be

Whitesnake,"I used to be the man for you,
Did everything you wanted me to,
So, tell me, baby,
What did I do wrong

I told you what you wanted to know,
Precious secrets never spoken before.
All I'm asking,
Where did I go wrong

Some things are better left unsaid,
But, all I do is cry instead,
Now, I've cried me a river,
Thinking how it used to be

There've been too many tears falling,
And there've been too many hearts
Breaking in two.
Remember what we had together,
Believing it would last forever.
So, tell me, baby,
Where did I go wrong

Everything I had was yours,
More than I have ever given before,
So, won't you tell me
Did I hurt you so bad

I guess I'm fooling myself,
'Cause I want you and no one else.
And I can't understand
Why you're doing these things to me

And there've been too many hearts
Breaking in two

To lead me through the night
Need someones arms
To hold and squeeze me tight

When the night begins
I'm at an end
'Cause I need your love so bad

Need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up
And tell my when I'm lying

When the lights are low
And it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up
And bring it on home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, baby
So it can be read to me

Tell me that you love me
Stop driving me mad
Because I need your love so bad

I need a soft voice
To talk to me at night
Don't won't to worry, baby
I know we'll make everything alright

Every time I close my eyes
I can't escape your face

I never realized
My love could be so blind

I realize without you
I can't face another day 

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love

Standing on the shore,
Head in the clouds,
Your pockets filled with dreams
Bound for glory
On the seven seas of life,
But, the ocean is deeper than it seems 

The wind was with you
When you left on the morning tide,
You set your sail for an island in the sun,
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead,
For the storm has just begun 

Take me with you,
Take me far away,
Lead me to the distant shore 

Sail your ship across the water,
Spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see
You're the one who holds the key,
Or sailing ships will pass you by 

You cry for mercy,
When you think you've lost your way,
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone
So find the strength and you will see
You control, your destiny,
After all is said and done 

So take me with you,
Take me far away,
An' lead me to the distant shore 

Sail your ship across the water,
Spread your wings across the sky 
Take the time to see
You're the one who holds the key,
Or sailing ships will pass,
Sailing ships will pass you,
Sailing ships will pass you by...

Take me with you,
Take me far away,
We'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see
You control, your destiny,
So sailing ships don't pass you by 

So take me with you,
Take me far away,
We'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see
You control, your destiny,
So sailing ships don't pass,

To give me a line
She said boy what have you done
You've been passing your time with a holy man
Talking about the moon and sun
And I can't tell the difference
Between the fool and wise
Show me a river to follow
Away from all these lies

Called to the Captain
To put me ashore
For it looked like no man's land
Is this the way to follow
I cried as I shook his hand
He told me had no answer
He didn't really hold the key
I am a simple man
Was all he said to me

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me a hand
I've been out in the cold too long
Won't you understand

I heard my mother crying
She was calling out my name
Whisper in the dark night
Saying who's to blame
The hour glass keeps turning
With not enought sand to see
I am a holy man
So don't you bother me

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me a hand

Don't like what I see

I think of a place where there's
Love overflowing;
I wish I was home,
I wish I was back there,
With the things I've been knowing.
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning,
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall
Have a meaning.
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clean.
Maybe there;s a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction;
It sure would be nice to be back home,
Where there's love and affection.
And just maybe I can convince time
To slow up.
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up;
Time, please be my friend,and let me start again...
Suddenly my world is gonna change its face
But I still know where I'm going;
I have had my mind spun around and around
In space
And yet I've watched it growing.
Oh, I know you're listening Lord,
So won't you please don't make it hard
I know I shouldn't believe everything, everything
That things we see.
Tell me, should I try and stay
Or maybe I should run away
Would it be better, better
Just to let things be?
Living here in this brand-new world
Might be a fantasy; yes it might be
But it taught me to love,
So I know that it's real, its real, real to me...
And I've learned that we must look
Inside our hearts to find...
Yeah we gotta find
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine-

Whitney Houston,"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.

Whitney Houston,"I know I may have made mistakes before
But now I understand what those mistakes were for Throughout my travels girl I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide
A bird in the hand beats two in a bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be thayt we're the only ones thinking of
Harmony, ecstacy, there's something about this love

[Chorus]
We, we have something in common
Girl (Boy) you mean so much to me it should be plain to see That we... We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days
You're my man and I'm your girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side till the very end
All in all, best of love, we are friends

Now, said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child, shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

It's time for all of us to fight

We must work while it is day

Lost, nowhere to run
So I'm asking, takes sacrificing

Whitney Houston,"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally 
Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
From wanting far too much for far too long 
Looking back, I could have done it differently 
Won a few more moments, who can tell? 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know, I know him well 

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide 
Looking back, I could have played it differently 
Learned about the man before I fell 
But I was ever so much younger then 

Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine) 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 

Didn't I know how it would go 
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart 

Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 
It took some to understand him 
Hoo ooh I know him so well",I Know Him So Well,1996

But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

And now that I am here with you

I look into your eyes

Whitney Houston,"Mommies and daddies always believe
That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king

A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king

It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive
That's what heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all those wonderful gifts he could bring

Who would imagine, who could imagine
Who would imagine a king

Mmm

Whitney Houston,"We all want to make a place in this world 
We all want our voices to be heard 
Every one wants a chance to be someone 
We all have dreams we need to dream 
Sweeter than any star you can reach 
'cause when you reach and find, you've found someone 
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing 
The greatest gift this life can bring 
Is when you look back and know 
You were loved 

[Chorus]
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart 
Along the way 
You can look back and say (mm) 
You were loved (yes you were) 

You can have diamonds in your hands 
Have all the riches in the land 
But, without love, 
You don't really have a thing, no no 
When somebody cares that you're alive 
When somebody trusts you with their life 
That's when you'll know (huh) 
That you have all you need 
You'll hold this world's most priceless gift 
The finest treasure that there is 
You can look back and know 
You were loved

So many roads that you can take 
Whatever way you go 
Don't take that road alone

So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry

I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye

Would a sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind

Now you say you're sorry and you've
Changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye

Fine, fine, fine, fine
It's alright

I had a dream last night
That the world stopped turning
But your madness, it kept on

And I really wasn't learning
Should have seen it all along

And I wish I knew it
I just could not see your games
I got respect for you
And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain

I would stick up for you
'Cause I did (I did adore you) adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice
On those lonely 
(On those lonely lonely lonely nights) nights
But I should have figured you out

Whitney Houston,"I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Then they hung out, but you came home around three 
If six of y'all went out 
Then four of you were really cheap 
'Cause only two of you had dinner

It's not right but it's okay

You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy)
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID

I've been through all this before 
So how could you think 
That I would stand around and take some more 
Things are gonna change 
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore 
That's why you have to leave 
So don't turn around to see my face 
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that 
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back 
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me

Whitney Houston,"Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put a body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything is right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess

It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience a hurt so
Don't panic when you bit the danger zone

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When you battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you're got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day

When your world's falling apart
All you got to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's answer in your heart
So let your light shines, my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well you can't sleep cause your problems are too deep
And there's always something getting the way

And when you turn on the evening news
Mass confusion is the only thing you'll see
Well there's no question
That we need a new direction cause
We all could use dome peace and harmony

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When you battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you're got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day",Love Will Save the Day,2000

It's not very easy living all alone

But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together

You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door

Come on, come on, come on! 

[Chorus]
Tell me no
I'll show you I can
Tell me no
I'll dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Come on and go!
Tell me no! 

For every step I take you're right there
Trying to block my next move.
And if you're making me feel bad,
Then tell me then do you feel good?
I'm just human and all I'm doing
Is what my heart tells me I should
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on! 

[Chorus]

No no no no no no
It motivates me more and more
And I think it's time you know
You're giving me something to look forward
And I can't wait for the day
I can rub things in your face
I ain't gon stop til I'm done
I've reached the top, I'm Number One
But every time you try and tell me no
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on

Whitney Houston,"Oh baby oh baby yeah yeah yeah
Such a pleasure loving you
It's all mine

I feel better knowing you
Ooh you've got me thinking
It's better to give and take
I don't have to beg you too
You're so good to me
Carries me from day to day
I appreciate the things you do
Ooh but there's one thing I had to tell you boy
I dig your actions
But a lot of things you say

I listen to the things you say
Who you're calling me oh oh
I listen to the things you say
To me baby
In a poem on a card
Serenade my heart
I listen to the things you say
Who you're calling me oh oh
I listen to the things you say
To me baby
In a card of a song
Say my name please

Lovely letters come at times I know I don't deserve it
Any weather you'll come through
Ooh you've got me gleaming
I feel more than I worth
You're my treasure
I'll take you
Over anything
That's pleasing on this earth
I appreciate the things you do
But there's one thing I had to tell you boy
I dig your actions
But I love your words

[Chorus]
Every word that you say
Makes a day much brighter
Melody that you play
I hear by the way and the love is lighter
Speak to me

Whitney Houston,"I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real, you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah yeah, mmm, yeah yeah

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lines
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now it's time for me to take control

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real you know
Time for me to do it

Oh, I start again go back to one
I'm running things in my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm gonna take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real, you know
It's time for me to do it
See I'm not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong

Whitney Houston,"If I changed my mind
If I changed my faith
Every time a stop light signaled
Each time I made mistakes

I don't think that I would be where I am today
I live my life without regrets
What you see is, what you see is
What you see is what you get and I'm

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed, unashamed

Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams
I'm counting all my blessings and the gifts I have received
Still there's always someone, something to overcome
Took all my life to understand that I am what I am, who I am
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Do you wanna know how it goes?
Do you wanna control how I feel?
Do you wanna stay in my life?
Then listen here and listen good
You got to get it, got to get it, got to get it right
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart

Why? How? All night long
(All night long)

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian with
Good conversation plenty big faces
It's a must I stay luxurious
Jewelry cut precision like I bust
Been winnin' since Funkdafied blew up
It's evident, shit I can't be touched
Niggas say I'm too much, I trust it's true
Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through
Drive by, your bitch say don't look, you do
Shine so bright in the wet U2
You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight
Ain't nothing in the world that Brat can't do
She attractive to them, him, her, and you shit
Frostbit, December Unrestricted
Drop dead, the cost is priceless
Due to the content I suggest you'll like this

What do you like?
A whole lot of foreplay
Right before you get it started
What do you like?
Me on top
You on the bottom, tight body
What do you like?
Somebody that can make you say
Wow, know how to all night long
All night long, tell me

Whassup? The setting, a hot-ass club
And you still be sweating me
I don't see nothing wrong with giving a little love
But nigga just let me breathe
Damn, you cute as hell so let's switch the digits
Then I got to leave
And you can buy me a couple of drinks
But I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privacy
And I like it sex and ecstasy
When the belt buckle loosen up, undress me
Already juiced up, that come naturally
Wax on and off so romantically
No woman can slow dance or throw down like I can
Ask if you curious to know what I like, man

[Chorus]

Let me tell you something
Well I start at the top of the list
With my pretty eyes, a cute nose and these fat ass lips
My medallion sit in the middle of my tits
It's hit after hit, shit sweet every sip 
Down to the last drip drop, watch the hips rock
Color Me Bad, tick tock you don't stop 
'Till the thick thighs, dick rise when I skip by
I ain't surprised I'm what'chu like nigga

Whitney Houston,"So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
You've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey,
I love you
Never again to be all alone

'Cause you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

And you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
With song
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life oooh",You Light Up My Life,2002
Whitney Houston,"I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Daring can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you",Song for You,2002
Whitney Houston,"Think it over, think it over... 

Some people say You've been messing around, 
Wish You could hear what they say
I'm not too sure, But You're just not the same, 
We got to find us a way
 
[Chorus:]
Think it over, 
Before You do something to tear us apart
Think it over, 
All this talk is breaking My heart
Think it over, 
Before You go out and do it again, 
Think it over, 
Just get together before it all ends
Think it over, Think it over

In the beginning, we both really cared
That's something that You should know
Let's think about all the love that we shared, 
You shouldn't let it all go, so

Think it over, 
Before You do something to tear us apart
Think it over, 
All this talk is breaking My heart
Think it over, 
Before You go out and do it again, 
Think it over, 
Just get together before it all ends
Think it over, Think it over

Think, Think it over
Think it over, 
Think, Think it over, over

Better think, 
Better think of the things You've done to Me
Better think, 
Better think before I set You free
Better think, 
Better think before You do wrong again
Better think, 
Better think before the evening ends

Think, Think it over
Think it over, 
Think, Think it over

Better think, Better think
What it's like to be all alone
Better think, Better think
What it's like in an empty home
Better think, Better think
'Cause I'm willing to forgive and forget
Better think about the love
That You ain't gonna get

Think it over

Can't we forget about the love that we had.
And make it just like brand new
I'm not too proud to forgive and forget, 
But baby, what about you?",Think It Over,2002
