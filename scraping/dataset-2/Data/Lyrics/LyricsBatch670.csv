Aretha Franklin,"It's an evil wind that blows no good, yeah
It's a sad heart that won't love like I know it should
Oh, how lonesome (oh how lonesome)
You must be (you must be)
It's a shame (shame, shame)
If you don't share your love with me

It's a heartache, yeah (it's a heartache)
When love is gone (baby, it's a heartache)
But it's bad (bad) and even sad (sad) oh later on
And there's no one blinder than you won't see
It's a shame (shame, shame)
If you don't share some of your love with me

I can't help it, oh no
He is gone
I must try to forget
Because I've got to live on
Oh, it's a good thing, it's a sweet thing (it's a sweet thing)
To love someone (such a sweet thing)
But it's bad (bad) and even sad (sad)
When it's not returned
And oh, how lonesome, how lonesome, how lonesome (oh, how lonesome)
You must be (you must be)

I tell you it would be a shame (shame, shame)
A shame if you don't share your love with me (share your love with me)
It would really be a mistake, baby (shame, shame)
If you don't share your love with me (share your love with me)
It would sure be a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share
Share your love with me (share your love with me)",Share Your Love With Me [#],2005
Aretha Franklin,"Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Aretha Franklin,"What now my love, now that you've left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn to ashes
And my hopes turn to bits of clay?

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world falling all around me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where that sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone?
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live if I should live or die

What now my love, now there is nothing?
Only my last, my last good-bye","What Now, My Love?",2005

Aretha Franklin,"It isn't by chance I happen to be a boulevardier, the toast of Paree,
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.
Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,
Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamor and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.
Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.",When the World Was Young,2005
Aretha Franklin,"Super highways coast to coast just easy to get anywhere
On the trans continental overload; just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel when there's no destination that's too far
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are?

Living in America, hand to hand across the nation
Living in America, got to have a celebration!

Aretha Franklin,"A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight,
And no one there you can kiss good night.

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom;
But a room is not a house,
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart.

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends it ends in tears.

Darling, have a heart,
Don't let one mistake keep us apart.
I'm not meant to live alone. Turn this house into a home.
When I climb the stair and turn the key,
Oh, please be there still in love with me.",A House Is Not a Home,2005

That I'd leave you if I could

I have read this book so many times
But nowhere can I find the page
That change what I experience today

Now I know that life is meant to be hard
That's how I learn to appreciate my God
Though my courage made me try
I can tell you I won't hide
Because the footprints show you are by my side

You can lie to a child with a smilin' face
Tell me that color ain't about race
You can cast the first stones, you can break my bones
But you're never gonna break 
You're never gonna break my faith

Won't you help them to understand
That when someone takes the life of an innocent man

Is set the soul free where it's supposed to be?

Aretha Franklin,"I saw your face as I hurried past the cafe
And the rain felt like long lost tears
As it trickled down the window pane

And in a moment
All the years were simply washed away
'Cause when our eyes met, when our eyes met
There was nothing left to say

I caught my breath
I fell out of touch with time 'cause it was you
With a part of me I'd forgotten that I ever knew

I stood to greet you and you held me
Just a little bit too long
Ooh, but we've come so far, we've come so far
But the feeling's still so strong

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

That same perfume
Carries such a lot of memories of a time
When we dreamed sweet dreams
Never knowing they'd be left behind

Love is a memory, like a picture
And it never seems to fade
Ooh, and I still believe, and I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost, yeah
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was, yeah, yeah

And I still believe, I still believe
And I still believe, I still believe

My lonely days are over, mmm yeah
And life, and life is like a song, ooh oh oh

My heart was wrapped up in clover 
The night that I looked at you, ooh ooh 

I found a dream 
That I could speak to
A dream that I
That I could call my own
I found a thrill
A thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known

Yeah! You smiled baby, baby, baby then the spell was cast
And here we are, here we are, here we are in Heaven

Aretha Franklin,"Day after day,
Alone on a hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,

But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.

Well on the way,
Head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
or the sound he appears to make,
and he never seems to notice,

But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.

And nobody seems to like him,
they can tell what he wants to do,
and he never shows his feelings,

But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.

Ooh, ooh,
Round and round and round.

And he never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him,

Come adore on bended knee

Whom the choirs of angels praise

How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

And life, and life is like a song, ooh oh oh

At last, at last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover 
The night that I looked at you, ooh ooh 

I found a dream 
That I could speak to
A dream that I
That I could call my own
I found a thrill
A thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known

Yeah!
Yeah! You smiled baby, baby, baby then the spell was cast
And here we are, here we are, here we are in Heaven
And you are mine, you are mine at last, at last

Aretha Franklin,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And now you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that, that look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey, hey

I asked the Lord, give me strength and don't let me fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And now you see me (see me) somebody new
I'm not that tender little person, still sweat for you
So you felt like dropping by and you expected me to be free
Well, I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Oh, no (oh no) walk out the door (walk out the door)

All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

J'avais si peur que tu m'oublies
Mais tu m'aimes toujours, mon amour

Sunny, tu m'as ramené tant de soleil
Sunny, le ciel est si bleu quand je m'éveille
Je me vois déjà aux vacances d'été
Les beaux jours durent toute l'année
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, merci pour toutes les choses que je te dois

Ari Hest,"At the midnight hour you can feel the minutes fade
Licking wounds from yesterday, bracing for tomorrow's stage
I create these monsters, seems like every way I can
It's never my intention, but somehow it feels strangely planned

And this goes to show you
Ignorance is under, â??cause

[Chorus]
I'd rather forget all about my past
Cruel how these moments never cease to last
And you could do better than this
If you refuse to hide
These monsters will subside

Story after story, squeezing fiction out of fact
Trying to face forward, but always looking back
Conjuring up danger when you know you're safe and sound
Once you start to question yourself, the road you take leads down, down

And this goes to show you
Ignorance is unde

How can I stay here where others would run?

I fan a dying flame

Along the edge
They linger on the banks, in search of refuge

Darling, don’t cry

Don’t you know why

There’s night at the end that will show me a way

Ari Hest,"I packed up my bags
Put in my favorite Levis
Laid my mandolin beside the door
Said to momma
I won't be long
Don't worry about me 
I'll be home before dark

One way out and no return
I watched the sun go down
Across the plains from Denver
Lord, how the western sky can burn

Met a boy in the darkness
Handsome, tall and heartless
I loved him like an eagle loves the wind
Till I heard him say
I won't be long
Don't worry about me
I'll be home before dark

I'll be alright
And you'll be fine without me
I'll be home before dark

To me she looks like momma
I see an eagle's shadow in her eyes

We blew the candles out together
I wonder will she take me by surprise
When she says momma
I won't be long

And hes quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

If I could get out of this place

Who never had time for a wife
And hes talkin' with davy who's still in the navy

But its better than drinkin' alone

And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

With you I feel I have a connection 
With you I have a sweet understanding of you 

You invited me to see los jaguares and you took me out for a glass of red wine told me all about your mischievous childhood I thought 'I like the way we spend time' and I think I could see us together sort of permanently I thought you felt the same but I wasn't sure 'cause you seemed shy to me

Still a swoon in a cocoon
Soon you might emerge
And you're made to emerge

A little longing to love, lush
Starving for affection
Hidden by the size of my perfection
With one exception

If you wanna butterfly
You gotta be a butterfly
You know that nothing falls out of the sky
Still a swoon in a cocoon

If you wanna butterfly
You gotta be a butterfly
You know that nothing falls out of the sky

How do I hide somebody from the great blue wide?
I'll come and sweep you up
'Cause your time ain't up, be patient

Now you see the sun is rising and you're realizing
Wise enough to know
That you gotta let yourself grow

If you wanna butterfly
You gotta be a butterfly
You know that nothing falls out of the sky
Still a swoon in a cocoon

If you wanna butterfly
You gotta be a butterfly
You know that nothing falls out of the sky

What goes around comes back around
This is nature's way
Be conscious of what you do
Because you will be repaid

If you put turnips in the ground
You will not harvest grapes
You are what you attracted
And this is why I say, uhhh

If you wanna a butterfly
You gotta be a butterfly
You know that nothing falls out of the sky
Still a swoon in a cocoon

If you wanna a butterfly
You gotta be a butterfly
You know that nothing falls out of the sky

Constantly creepin' caterpillar
Still a swoon in a cocoon
Soon you might emerge
And be made to emerge

Maybe
Still a swoon in a cocoon
Still a swoon in a cocoon
Still a swoon in a cocoon

Algún presente que te agrade Señor,

Ariana DeBoo,"I hear a little patience what a man need
But bottling feelings’ll make a man bleed
The words leave my mouth in a stampede
Watch em galloping, breaking records for land speed
My heart pumps and my lips tend to obey
You're just so Bay, I hope you don't say “no way”
Now that I came back around to okay
And if you love me, I will love you till we go grey
So be my do-ray-me-fa-so-la-ti-do
We'll hit El Farolito, and get a bomb burrito
I try to kill my ego when your subject appears
But I still think of you when I had a couple of beers
I'll see you soon I got no use for a bucket of tears
It seemed unlucky how we'd orbit each other for years
We got our timing right and then I collided with you
The wait is worth it in the moment we finally do

What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue
I'm always coming back to you
Your boo, your boo, your boomerang
I know neither of us have the key
But I'm telling you, you have to see
How you're always coming back to me
My boo, my boo, my boomerang

You press my buttons like I were a Nintendo
Me and her up in a permanent limbo
It's like it’s nothing when we're burnin the indo
The streetlights like a blur in the window
I got no cause to feel I was betrayed
It's just a symptom of the of the game we played
We pull the hearts out of each others' chests, pull the pins out of the hearts
And toss em back and forth like they're grenades
Hot potato, hot potato, what did you do?
Blow my fuckin arm off and then kiss the booboo
Hit me with a shovel, and then say ""I dig you""
And be colder than an igloo
When you want me I don't want you, when I want you, you don't want me
When I sing a tune and you sing it too then it's ""womp womp"" in the wrong key
You always let me go and do my thang

You tryin' to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain’t so funny when the joke’s on you
Uh, the joke’s on you
Got everyone’s laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
How come you look so cool?
'Cause that’s the only thing that I’ve learned at school
Said that’s the only thing I’ve learned at school

My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
But you were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I don’t know
Now you’re in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It’s not about who you are or your fancy car
You’re only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you really need to know
Catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

Popular, I know about popular
It’s not about who you are or your fancy car
You’re only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
It’s not about who you are or your fancy car
You’re only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you really need to know",Popular Song,2012
Ariana Grande,"Baby I got love for thee
So deep inside of me I don't know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words cant even touch what's in my heart

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling

And I say baby, baby
Baby (baby I)
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it

Baby, baby (ooh oh)

Baby I'm so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk) I'll be around
Oh baby, see baby I been feelin' you
Before I even knew what feelings were about
Oh baby

When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling

Straight up, you got me
All in, how could I not be
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than word love can say it
It's better not explaining that's why I keep saying baby I

Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby

Tomorrow he's flying away
Away from me

I don't need another gift

This year can you

Just make it snow in California

Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay

I checked the news and it said
It'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I I really need him to stay

Can't you make his

Won't you find a way

Ariana Grande,"Bless my soul Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and we are talking SRO

He was a no one
A zero , zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that

When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
On every vase

From heroes fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now Nouveau Riche and famous
He could tell you
Whats a Grecian urn

Say amen and there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And his perfect package
In a a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie he comes he sees he conquers
Honey the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
From zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the 'glad' in 'gladiator'? (Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre? (Hercules!)
Isn't he bold? (No one braver!)
Isn't he sweet? (Our favorite flavor!)
Hercules! Hercules! (Hercules!)
Hercules! Hercules!
Hercules! Hercules!

Bless my soul Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high and the nicest guy
Not conceited

He was a nothing
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero

He hit the heights a breakneck speed!
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes indeed!","Zero to Hero [From ""Hercules""]",2015

So when they ask, ""How’s life?"" I go (sheesh, sheesh)

Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Flip it, flip it, flip it

Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
Talking about what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin' you ’cause you make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
Say, I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, it'd be so sour
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

El cartel con ariana 
Cada mañana nos ves en primera plana 
Y la advertencia es vana 
Nuestro virus de alerta 32 nos sana lo que la peste

Mis bacterias se dispersan 
Por todo el aire por todas partes 
Esta que arde si no lo sabes llegaste tarde ari con el cartel 
Rompiéndote la madre 

Esto se extiende esto se esparce puro rap latino por todas partes 
Esta que arde esta que arde

Ando regándome como el apeste 
Creando estilo creando ambiente

Traigo tu suerte traigo la muerte 
Pegando fuerte abriendo tu mente 
Comete esta mierda que esta caliente 
Y que se vaya todo el mundo ala verga guey 
No podéis evitarlo llego la puta ley

Go on your wicked dance
But every fight you're in
You're gonna end all alone
Shedding your blood again

It picks you up and throws you down
All I know is I am bound to fall

Love, you must be thinking of love
Got to keep moving

Love, oh love, oh love, oh love
Yeah you must be thinking of love

No matter what I say, it's nothin' but words
Just let me prove to you what I know is real
Let me express to you the way that I feel

I believe that love is synonymous
With heaven, such a sensual bliss
The way you touch me makes this life so good
A reward at the end of the long road

Got my mind made, I don't plan to leave
'cause you were meant for me, simple that may be
Why be complex, lovin' you is so easy

Ariel,"The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself
Can you do that?

My dear, sweet child, that's what I do
It's what I live for
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
To this
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula, please!""
And I help them
Yes I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

Have we got a deal?
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again
But you'll have your man
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh, and there is one more thing
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
But I don't have-
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle
What I want from you is your voice
But without my voice, how can I-
You'll have your looks, your pretty face
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle babble for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul

Come winds of the Caspian Sea

Ya no hay quien me espante
Ya es cosa pasada

Tengo mente maliciosa para hacer las cosas
Que todo salga bien
Yo digo que es por los golpes que tanto me han dado
Pero estoy al cien

Siempre es el mismo dilema
El rico es tema, siempre lo ha de ser

Aunque es triste andar sin un peso
El frijol y el queso son la mejor comida
Con leche recién ordeñada
De una buena vaca y tortillas de harina

De mi pobre viejo, nunca se me olvida

Ya les dije un rezo de la vida ruina",La Vida Ruina,2015

Ariel Camacho,"Las playas fueron testigo de aquel mal momento alla por Mazatlan
Cuando llego la marina, tenian ubicado al chapo guzman
Le cayeron por sorpresa las corporaciones de la federal
Iban cubriéndose el rostro, para que el señor no los fuera a mirar
El chapo traiba un pendiente, desde puente grande se pudo escapar
Le faltaban unos años, para que cumpliera lo que iba a pagar
El comandante le dijo
Porque no te fuiste amigo Guzman
Tienes algún gran pendiente
Para que te encuentres aquí en Mazatlan
No entendemos al gobierno
Si ellos protegian al chapo guzman

Muy bien que los financiaba
Cuando lo ocupaban, le querían ganar
La sierra se encuentra triste
Por esa factura que vino a pagar

Una vida de misterio
Me volví el numero uno
El gran Señor De Los Cielos
Nunca he tenido gobierno
Puede que esta operación
Pueda ser el plan perfecto

En la vida me rodié de amigos leales
Y traté de ser amable
Con aquellos que no fueron
Ahora espero de nuevo cantar victoria
Y el resto ya será historia
La inyección ya no hizo efecto
Siento una corazonada
Voy a emprender otro vuelo
Tal vez no regrese nunca
Voy a perderme en los cielos
Sin dejarles pista alguna
Por si de nuevo me buscan",El Señor De Los Cielos,2014

Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes Del Rancho,"Si pude soportar la muerte del viejón 
Que no soporte lidiar con algún cabrón 
Un día mi padre me dijo hay que ser muy fuerte 
Y esas palabras se grabaron en mi mente 

Me respetan porque siempre he respetado 
Me ven tranquilo pero no soy muy dejado 
Yo no estoy para andar entregando cuentas 
Ni mucho menos para enredarme en problemas 

No estoy solo tengo gente que me apoya 
Ando al cien con el que menea la olla 
Hay respaldo en Jalisco Y Sinaloa 
Son amigos de confianza 

Y amistades tengo pocas

(Esto es JG Music y seguimos trabajando) 

No me escondo porque no tengo pendiente 
Y donde me paro me vuelvo muy influyente 
Por mis plebes yo siempre he dado la cara 
Porque soy hombre hago valer mi palabra 

De este lado yo manejo la partida 
Siempre con la bendición del que está arriba 
No me gustan las armas ni la violencia 
Hay me hace esquina mi general de marina 

Por mi gente me verán poniendo el pecho 
Aquí andamos a pesar del mal arreglo 
Las envidias y humildad no se presumen 
Habrá cien ursurpadores que sea dios el que los juzge 

Ya lo han visto me he caído y levantando 
No presumo ni tampoco me le rajo 
Habrá cien ursurpadores y malinches 
Y se esperan cosas peores 

La misma biblia lo dice",Aquí Andamos,2017
Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes Del Rancho,"Se muy bien que aún recuerdan al Mentado 
Ese plebe atrabancado que se fue 
El que la perdió contento como regresar el tiempo 
Como no hecharle de menos compa Ariel 

Esta vida solo se vive un vez 
Por eso hay que disfrutarla al cien por ciento 
Cada vez que había chanza se mojaba la garganta 
Y lo hizo hasta en sus últimos momentos 

Cuando hay ganas tienes que salirle al toro 
Y con su guitarra en el hombro 
Decidió buscar su sueño 

Unos Plebes también le siguen el rollo 
No iba a faltar el apoyo 
Y le subimos al estéreo 

Platicaban de un mentado Ariel Camacho 
Empezaba lo mero bueno

Aquel sueño ya era toda una aventura 
El muchacho de Angostura iba pa arriba 
Después de quitarse el traje se ponía los huaraches 
En el rancho lo apodaron La Tuyia 

Fue sencillo de principio hasta el final 
Y eso es algo que le inculcaron sus padres 
Saludaba a todo mundo fue mi compa y lo presumo 
La humildad lo hacía grande entre los grandes 

Una madre con tristeza mira al cielo 
Y ese viejón de sombrero 
Pone su mano en el hombro 

El Mentado una mañana de febrero 
Decidió arrancar primero 
Y ahora no está con nosotros 

Hoy nos queda darle play a sus recuerdos 
así es la vida y ni modo

Te aferraste le hechaste todas las ganas 
De pronto llego la fama 
Y Te Metiste entre tu gente 

Pa' variar en donde quiera se oye El Karma 
Por supuesto se te extraña 
Y eso tenlo bien presente 

Esa frase está en la mente de tu raza

Ariel Pink,"The firing pulse around this bubbly light
The second they both stop it, it's probably wrong
Why do people only show forgiveness
When they want some pull in the Sun?
So I keep tryin' to understand where we are goin'
I keep searchin' for some meanin' in my dreams
And I'm dreamin' of bein' eaten by tigers
While the sparrows start to sing in a tree

And we always end up singin' the same songs
They remind us of the bullshit in the world
But they also remind us we are dying
That's why we want to sing 'em even more

I don't think we got where we were goin'
I had a dream that we were in a weird sky
Why do people let their dreams
Be somethin' so bad?
Such a weird fuckin' dream
Flyin' around into the sky, superman
Changing tigers and your arrows land in circles
Those religious fucks will never understand

And we always end up singin' the same songs
They remind us of the bullshit in the world
Maybe it wasn't really a dream
I can't really tell anymore

And we always end up singin' the same song
'Cause we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong
And we always end up singin' the same song
And we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget we were wrong",Tiger Dreams,2015

Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razón

Vamos viviendo
Viendo las horas
Que van pasando
Las viejas discusiones

Se van perdiendo
Entre las razones
Porque años atrás
Tomar tú mano

Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
Hacía parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razón

A todo dices que sí
A nada digo que no
Para poder construir
Esta tremenda armonía
Que pone viejo los corazones

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De temor

Ariel Rivera,"All you see are endless skies
Like an ocean lit by fireflies
With a long deep breath
I speak my heart
Saying things
I'm not sure just what they are
A feeling catches me by surprise
You can see forever
In a lover's eyes

I can stop myself
But on I go
Finding feelings
I have never known
There's hope beyond
Your wildest dreams
And the feeling
Is nothing to extreme
In a flash
Tomorrow begins to rise
You can see forever
In a lover's eyes

I can see your world
Beautiful and new
And although I'm not sure
Where it's leading to
We will travel on
Our fate unknown
And for once
I know I'm not alone
It's a trade we make
A sacrifice
Love never ending
Is surely worth the price
If we survive
Love holds no greater price
You can see forever
In a lover's eyes

Yo no sabía qué hacer
Sin trabajo, sin amigos
Sin nada para beber

Amontonaba problemas
No podía resolver
Ese ritmo cuesta abajo
Cuando te vi aparecer

Y dije
Ayúdeme, señorita
Ayúdeme, por favor

Al tercer día de ayuno
Fui a pedirle ayuda al señor
Y sentí que se reía
Al terminar mi oración

Andaba medio perdido
Ya no sabía qué hacer
Sin trabajo, sin amigos

Sin nada para beber

Why que abras esa botella, why brindemos por ella
Why hagamos el amor en el balcón.

Es un músculo sano pero necesita acción. 
Dame paz why dame guerra, why un dulce colocón
Why yo te entregaré lo mejor.

Dulce como el vino, salada como el mar, 
Princesa why vagabunda, garganta profunda, 
Sálvame de esta soledad.

Ella tiene la receta para estar mucho mejor. 
Sin truco, sin prisa, me entrega su sonrisa
Como una sacerdotisa del amor.

Luna llena, piel canela, dame noches de placer. 
A veces estoy mal, a veces estoy bien, 
Te daré mi corazón para que juegues con él.

Pero nunca iremos juntos al altar.

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Arild Andersen,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen grey faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1977

Padre perdonami, se ho fatto tutto male è solo colpa delle teorie.
Io sono pratica, ci provo a galleggiare e a fare i conti di logica.

Perché forse ho bisogno d'amore,
O forse ho soltanto voglia di contare

Quante parole che non dici e vorresti gridare,

Dei labirinti di coniugazioni.
Uscirne è difficile,
Tuoi rischiare di naufragare in un lago di virgole.
Ma perché vuoi spiegare l'amore?
Sono solo due numeri prima da calcolare!

Quante parole, quante regole scelte da fare,

Arise [Metal],"I feel the shivers running down my spine, it wakes the powers of my
Undivine.
My mind betrays me I'm leaping back in time.
All those memories left behind, In the torture chamber where I lived to be:
All my purity is left in greed. Can't take control, my ego burns me out,
Everything seems so faded now.

[Chorus]
I've seen it, believed it, but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it, I've lived it but now I know - my schizophrenia is gone.

Feels like I'm trapped between two worlds, the doors are locked in either
Ways, I can hear my echo but there are no walls.
A sick brain in a tortured host.

[Chorus]
I've seen it, believed it, but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it, I've lived it but now I know - my schizophrenia is gone.

But I have kept talking, not a soul is listening but me, starving inside,
Dreaming of life.
Is my soul at a restingpoint?
Feels like I'm being torn apart.

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

En una esquina haciéndonos tanto
Se siente fuera de control
Te quiero hasta que salga el sol (hey)

Tengo tantas ganas de ti
Amarte es esencial
Me desespero si no estás aquí
Regresa que no puedo más

Y mientras tanto sigo esperando
Qué va a pasar contigo y conmigo
Mami yo quisiera volver a ser tu amigo

Y tener los privilegios
Que teníamos antes en el colegio
En serio,
Yo soy de tu promedio ma'

Tan bonita
Tu sabes que aquí se te quiere
Que gratis se te quiere

Arlen Roth,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

L'histoire en quelques mots
Du beau roman d'une jeune midinette,
Et d'un petit Parigot
Tous les refrains d'amour sont un peu bêtes,
Celui là l'est aussi
Mais si vous reprenez en chœur ma chansonnette,
Je vous dirai: Merci!

Elle était jeune et belle,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il eut le béguin pour elle
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle était demoiselle,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il se débrouilla pour qu'elle ne le soit plus!

Il était au chômage,
Comme de bien entendu !
Ça lui faisait déjà un gentil petit revenu...
Comme de bien entendu !

Voulant faire une folie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il offrit à sa mie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Un billet de la loterie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Ça ne lui fit jamais que cent balles de perdues...
Comme de bien entendu !

Mais il se mit à boire
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle ne fit pas d'histoires,
Comme de bien entendu !
Mais pour ne pas être une poire,
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle se consola en le faisant cocu.
Comme de bien entendu !

Il la trouva mauvaise
Comme de bien entendu !
Mais elle ramenait du pèze,
Comme de bien entendu !
Au lieu de ramener sa fraise,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il se contenta de lui foutre son pied au cul,
Comme de bien entendu !

Et, depuis, l'on raconte
Comme de bien entendu !
Qu'il y trouve son compte,

Et, quand chez lui, on monte,
Comme de bien entendu !

Shivered with the feelin' that he knowed

So fine that he had to go
Went to see what it was that he knowed

Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys

Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your

I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you

I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.

Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that
You have to go.

Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna
Do?

Every hand in the land
Shakes along with me
It don't seem that I can dream
Like I used to dream

Maybe that somebody is shaking me
If I fell I could tell
It may be that somebody is making me
Dream that you're forever
Gone away from me

Every toe that I know
Step away with me
I can't seem to get where
I want to be
Maybe it's my own foot
That keeps tripping me
Trip trap - flip flap
It must come to wherever from it comes
Through to me
I can't walk to where
My own dreams talk to me

Every face in this place
Take your eyes away
Blink if you think that
There's another way
Maybe it's my own eyes
That don't see the way
The time is blind
It may come to pass
That I will lose my mind
I can't live without the love I left behind
I can't live without the love I left behind



",Every Hand in the Land,1969
Arlo Guthrie,"You know the guitar came to Europe with the gypsies 700 years ago
Spain brought the guitar to Mexico 400 years ago
U.S.A. picked a quarrel with Mexico and got Texas and California
And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us

It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats
Up in Syracuse there's a 92 year old woman
Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I die just bury me deep
Down at the foot of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old number nine
As she goes roaring by

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times do I crave
Place the tombstone at my head and my feet
Tell my friends that I've gone to sleep

In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born

But as I sit here today
Many mile's I am away
From the place I rode my pony
Through the draw

Where the oak and black-jack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
And I feel back in those hills
Where I belong

Now as I turn life a page
To the land of the great Osage

Running down the road
Make my get away
Everything I told you
Was just yesterday
Yes, You know I'm off again
Oh, and I've been told
You were there beside me
Running down the road

Walking down the street
Meet me down the line
Police car at my feet
They were there on time
Everybody's looking for
Something to explode
How can you afford the time
Running down the road

My feet are getting tired
My head begins to spin
Who of us is dreaming
You or me or him?
Yes, You know I'm waiting
While these times unfold
Looking backward briefly
Running down the road

To hear a cowboy sing an old time song

Last night I sat till closing time
Thinking of the things that crossed my mind

I hope they play this song of mine
On the jukebox for a dime

You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song

",Cowboy Song,1973
Arlo Guthrie,"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black
All except beneath the trees of Eden

The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Through its shadow's metal badge
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden
",Gates of Eden,1973

Point out to me their wagon tracks

And after them I'll travel and after them l'll ride

I heard the notes of the big guitar

And the voice of the Gypsies singing

I saw her fair face beaming

Her heart in tune to the big guitar

Have you forsaken your baby?
Have you forsaken your husband dear?

To go with the Gypsy Davey
And I've forsaken my mansion high

But not my blue eyed baby
Not my blue eyed babe
She smiled to leave her husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davey

But the tears come a-trickling down her cheeks
To think about her blue eyed baby
To think about her blue eyed babe

Made of Spanish leather
Come give to me your lily-white hand
And we'll ride home together
And home again we'll ride

Arlo Guthrie,"By Woody Guthrie

Ramblin' around your city
Ramblin' around your town
I never see a friend I know
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round

My mother hoped that I might be
A man of some renown
But I am just a refugee
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round

The peach trees they are loaded
The branches bending down
I pick 'em all day for a dollar boys
As I go 'ramblin 'round
As I go 'ramblin' 'round

Sometimes the fruit gets rotten
And falls on to the ground
There's a hungry mouth for every peach
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round



",Ramblin' Round,1973
Arlo Guthrie,"Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home 
And I backed him on the banjo so he didn't play alone 
We've got five generations of a fiddle playin' clan 
And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man 

Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie 
Written on the road by the light of the moon 
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan 
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon 

Well, my daddy had a fiddle, and he laid it on his son 
Sayin', ""Son, play the fiddle like your fiddlin' folks done.""
Well, it's hard to learn to fiddle 
When you're fiddlin' on the run 
But fiddlin' is fiddlin', and fiddlin' is fun",Uncle Jeff,1973
Arlo Guthrie,"Children of Abraham, what's your story?
Killing each other for a piece of land
Children of Abraham, this ain't glory
You've got to walk together hand in hand

Take down the flags that just separate the people
Take down the wire on the boundary
Take back the words that were spoken in anger
You've got to live just like a family

Children of Abraham,I must be dreaming
Rivers of blood running through your hands
Children crying, mothers screaming
It just wasn't looking like the Promised Land",Children of Abraham,1974
Arlo Guthrie,"I ain't got a nickel to call mine
The government has made me pay my tax on time
They've taken all my bread and left me here for dead
I ain't even got a lousy dime

Who the hell wants money
When there ain't none to be had
It don't make the good times better
It don't make the bad times bad

Well, you find out who your friends are
When you ain't got a dime
Just trying to make the best of these hard times

I've got fifteen cars and I can't afford the gas
We've got a horse but how long can she last
My managers enraged, my banker stands there days
Funny how the money goes so fast

Who the hell wants money
When there ain't none to be had
It don't make the good times better
It don't make the bad times bad

Well, you find out who your friends are
When you ain't got a dime
Just trying to make the best of these hard times

We are broke but we've been broke before
But being broke don't scare us anymore
My daddy's broke and grandpa too
But I'm still here to sing for you

Me and my pal
We had some very good times
Me and my goose his name was Al
And he cost only a dime

Over meadows we'd stray
Playing all day
I missed him at night until dawn
Then one day I found he wasn't around
I wondered where Al could have gone

I looked everywhere he just wasn't there
Where could a goose be all day
I miss my pal
I miss my Al
It's sad that things turned out this way

Then mom brought him
I remember her grin
Stuffed with his feet pointed straight

I'll never forget the night that we ate
Al off of the old yellow plate",Me and My Goose,1974
Arlo Guthrie,"The whole country is getting weirder
Ya know, the whole wide world's insane
Give me a hit of my memory and let me think back again

No more sharing in the can, lord
Everybody just brings his own
Nobody rolls joints with their hands anymore, no

So I just sit at home, alone
Everybody is really stranger
Where were you guys yesterday?
Women attack me out on the street, lord
Men attack me anyway
Pa swaps ma for aunt matilda, 
She swaps him for young maybelline
The whole block is moving in together

What a scene, lord, what a scene
No more riots at the old school
Everybody just comes in stoned
Everybody looks oh so cool, lord
It's so cool, lord, I must be a fool
This whole scene is out of hand, now, later for today
Give me a hit of my memory, and let me be on my way
Let me be on my way",Nostalgia Rag,1974

With my friends and my companions by my side
And I think of you wherever I do go
I'm a rambler, I ain't hard to satisfy

[Chorus:]
Won't be long till I am home again with you
Just a few more miles to go
Won't be long till I can get back on my own
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you

In the airport I'm standing in a line
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time
To be in some other town most every night

[Chorus:]

And when friends come by to pass the time away
And when the winds that chill the Bershires in the night

Arlo Guthrie,"The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are piled in their cresote dumps
They're flying you back to the Mexico border
To pay all your money to wade back again

My father's own father, he wanted that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees
And they rode the truck till they took down and died

Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus why Maris
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane
And all they will call you will be deportees.

Some of us are illega, and others not wanted
Our work contract's out and we have to move on
But it's six hundred miles to that Mexican border
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like theives.

We died in your hills, we died in your deserts
We died in your valleys and died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes
Both sides of the river, we died just the same.

Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus why Maris
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane
And all they will call you will be deportees.

A sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon
Like a fireball of lightning, it shook all our hills
Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?
The radio says they are just deportees.

Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?
To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil
And be called by no name except deportees?",Deportees,1974
Arlo Guthrie,"How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been

Old age is golden so I've heard said
But sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed
With my ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup
My eyes on the table until I wake up
As sleep dims my vision I say to myself
Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?
But though nations are warring and business is vexed
I'll stick around to see what happens next

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been

When I was young my slippers were red
I could kick up my heels right over my head
When I was older my slippers were blue
But still I could dance the whole night thru
Now I am older my slippers are black
I huff to the store and I puff my way back
But never you laugh; I don't mind at all
I'd rather be huffing than not puff at all

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been

I get up each morning and dust off my wits
Open the paper and read the obits
If I'm not there I know I'm not dead
So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed

That the cats with the bugs were there

You said that you were lied to
Well that ain't hard too see

And maybe you were fooled again by your people here at home
Because nobody could talk like you

Nobody elected your family
And we didn't elect your friends
No one voted for your advisers 
And nobody wants the men
You're the one we voted for, so you must take the blame
For handing out authority to men who were insane
You say its all fixed up now, you've got new guys on the line
But you had better remember this while you still got the time
Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war
Father still are asking what the whole damn thing was for 
And People still are hungry and people still are poor
And on this week of work these days don't feed the kids no more
Schools are still like prison

And everybody wants to take, nobody wants to give

And if I live a long life, all the stories I could tell
A mans who falls in poverty of sickness and of grief

Well I let the kids loose on the floor
And they ran round for a while or more
Till the manager with the broken smile
Said it's a dollar down and a quarter an aisle

Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb

I was down in the freezer upon my knees
Somebody was yelling that the price got freezed
There was a rioting mob, a strangling hold
I received the bill for the escaping cold

Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb

It was about this time that I was goin' insane
I went and picked the kids up in the other lane
Put back the food and ran out of the store
I ain't goin' back to that place no more

I don't mind no women's lib
But if my woman don't want to go down to the store

As the snow settles white
There's a fire burning bright
In Massachusetts

And there's a house upon a hill
That keeps us from the chill
And by the grace of God
We will be in Massachusetts

You can tell me about the times you spent
In the Rockies and on the plains
Please don't think that I'm the last to say
That there ain't lots of other places
In this world that still remain
Beautiful and unchanged
But they're just not the same

The sun comes up to meet the dawn
And there's a day that must go on
There's another night that's gone
In Massachusetts

And I could spend all of my days
And remain each day amazed
At the way each day is phrased
In Massachusetts

You can tell me about the times you spent
In the Rockies and on the plains
Please don't think that I'm the last to say
That there ain't lots of other places
In this world that still remain
Beautiful and unchanged
But they're just not the same

I know you would agree
There ain't nowhere else to be
Like Massachusetts

And there's a house upon a hill

Come on tell me about the time you spent

I didn't think then, now I know
How long it took love to grow

Oh babe, I long to hold you at night
We two together are so right
You make the darkness so bright

My love, we've had one hell of a time
And we've got over our crying
And we've come out of this fine

Because when two loves grow old
There can be no denying
That their love may soon grow colder
Yet that's when we started trying

Oh babe, this love we have must be for real
We've overcome, now it's sealed

You were far away
You must have known I was looking for you
You knew you couldn't stay
All these winds blowin' on me
Blowing in the nighttime lonely
Blew on over the ocean to you
Blew my words away

Put on your heavenly shoes babe
Walk around the clouds
You know that's where I'm bound to be now
I'm coming with the crowds
All these faces looking at me
Looking through me I don't mind
I just seen your face a-worrying
I loved you when you cried

Take my hand across the water
You won't leave no tracks behind
Step all over the moon lit ocean
It's only in your mind
All these thoughts just rip me
Who can heal a heart that's broken
Like the winds that blow unspoken
Blow my love away

Placed by fate's mysterious schemes
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Arise sweet destiny, time runs short
All of your patience has heard their retort
Hear us now for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Can you hear the words being whispered
All along the American stream
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few
You and your children with nothing to do
Hear us now for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Victor Jara of Chile
Lived like a shooting star
He fought for the people of Chile
With his songs and his guitar
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Victor Jara was a peasant
He worked from a few years old
He sat upon his father's plow
And watched the earth unfold
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Now when the neighbors had a wedding
Or one of their children died
His mother sang all night for them
With Victor by her side
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He grew up to be a fighter
Against the people's wrongs
He listened to their grief and joy
And turned them into songs
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He sang about the copper miners
And those who worked the land
He sang about the factory workers
And they knew he was their man
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He campaigned for Allende
Working night and day
He sang ""Take hold of your brothers hand
You know the future begins today""
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Then the generals seized Chile
They arrested Victor then
They caged him in a stadium
With five-thousand frightened men
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Victor stood in the stadium
His voice was brave and strong
And he sang for his fellow prisoners
Till the guards cut short his song
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

They broke the bones in both his hands
They beat him on the head
They tore him with electric shocks
And then they shot him dead
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Arlo Guthrie,"You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
Walk right in, it's around the back
Just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant

This song is called ""Alice's Restaurant
""It's about Alice, and the 
Restaurant, but ""Alice's Restaurant"" is not the name of the restaurant,
That's just the name of the song
That's why I call the song ""Alice's Restaurant.""

Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, two years ago, on Thanksgiving, 
When my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the restaurant

But Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the 
Restaurant, in the bell tower with her husband Ray and Facha, the dog

And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs 
Where the pews used to be, and havin' all that room (seein' as how they took 
Out all the pews), they decided that they didn't have to take out their 
Garbage for a long time.

We got up here and found all the garbage in there and we decided that it'd 
Be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump

So we took the half-a-ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW 
Microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction, and headed 
On toward the city dump. Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a 
Chain across the dump sayin', ""this dump is closed on Thanksgiving,"" and 
We'd never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in 
Our eyes, we drove off into the sunset lookin' for another place to put the garbage

We didn't find one till we came to a side road, and off the side of the side 
Road was another fifteen-foot cliff, and at the bottom of the cliff was 
Another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile was better than 
Two little piles, and rather than bring that one up, we decided to throw 
Ours down. That's what we did

Drove back to the church, had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, 
Went to sleep, and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone 
Call from Officer Obie. He said, ""kid, we found your name on a envelope at 
The bottom of a half a ton of garbage and I just wanted to know if you had 
Any information about it""

And I said, ""yes sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie. I put that envelope 
Under that garbage."" After speakin' to Obie for about forty-five minutes on 
The telephone, we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and he said 
That we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and 
Speak to him at the Police Officer Station. So we got in the red VW microbus 
With the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on 
Toward the Police Officer Station

Now, friends, there was only one of two things that Obie could've done at 
The Police Officer Station, and the first was that he could've given us a 
Medal for bein' so brave and honest on the telephone (which wasn't very 
Likely, and we didn't expect it), and the other thing was that he could've 
Bawled us out and told us never to be seen drivin' garbage around in the 
Vicinity again, which is what we expected

But when we got to the Police Officer Station, there was a third possibility 
That we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested, 
Handcuffed, and I said, ""Obie, I can't pick up the garbage with these here 
Handcuffs on."" He said ""shut up kid, and get in the back of the patrol car""

And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car, and drove to 
The quote scene of the crime unquote

I want to tell you 'bout the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this is 
Happenin'. They got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police 
Car, but when we got to the scene of the crime, there was five police 
Officers and three police cars, bein' the biggest crime of the last fifty 
Years and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it

And they was usin' up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin' 
Around the Police Officer Station. They was takin' plaster tire tracks, 
Footprints, dog-smellin' prints and they took twenty-seven 8 x 10 colored 
Glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of 
Each one explainin' what each one was, to be used as evidence against us
Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner, the 
Southwest corner
And that's not to mention the aerial photography!

After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was gonna put us in a cell

He said ""kid, I'm gonna put you in a cell
I want your wallet and your belt""
I said, ""Obie, I can understand your wantin' my wallet, so I don't have any 
Money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?"" and he said
""Kid, we don't want any hangin's
I said, ""Obie, did you think I was gonna 
Hang myself for litterin'?""

Obie said he was makin' sure, and, friends, Obie was, 'cause he took out the 
Toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took 
Out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars, roll the toilet paper out 
The window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie was makin' sure

It was about four or five hours later that Alice (remember Alice? 
There's a song about Alice)
Alice came by and, with a few nasty words to Obie on the 
Side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back to the church, had another 
Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up until the next 
Morning, when we all had to go to court. We walked in, sat down, Obie came 
In with the twenty-seven 8 times 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and 
Arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down

Man came in, said, ""All rise!"" We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the 
Twenty-seven 8 times 10 colored glossy pictures, and the judge walked in, sat 
Down, with a seein' eye dog and he sat down. We sat down

Obie looked at the seein' eye dog then at the twenty-seven 8 x 10 
Colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the 
Back of each one and looked at the seein' eye dog and then at 
The twenty-seven 8 x 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows 
And a paragraph on the back of each on and began to cry

Because Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American 
Blind justice, and there wasn't nothin' he could do about it, and the judge 
Wasn't gonna look at the twenty-seven 8 by 10 colored glossy pictures with 
The circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explainin' 
What each one was, to be used as evidence against us

And we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow

But that's not what I'm here to tell you about
I'm here to talk about the draft
They got a buildin' down in New York City called Whitehall Street, where you 
Walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected!

I went down and got my physical examination one day, and I walked in, sat 
Down (got good and drunk the night before, so I looked and felt my best when 
I went in that morning, 'cause I wanted to look like the All-American Kid 
From New York City. I wanted to feel like I wanted to be the 
All-american Kid from New York), and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down
Brung down, hung up and all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly things

And I walked in, I sat down, they gave me a piece of paper that said ""Kid
See the psychiatrist in room 604""

I went up there, I said, ""Shrink, I want to kill. I want to kill! I want to see 
Blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth! Eat dead, burnt bodies! I 
Mean Kill. Kill!""

And I started jumpin' up and down, yellin' ""KILL! Kill!"" and he started 
Jumpin' up and down with me, and we was both jumpin' up and down, yellin' 
""Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!"" and the sergeant came over, pinned a medal on me
Sent me down the hall, said ""You're our boy"". Didn't feel too good about it

Proceeded down the hall, gettin' more injections, inspections, detections 
Neglections, and all kinds of stuff that they was doin' to me at the thing 
There, and I was there for two hours three hours four hours I was 
There for a long time goin' through all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly things
And I was just havin' a tough time there, and they was inspectin', 
Injectin', every single part of me, and they was leavin' no part untouched!

Proceeded through, and I finally came to see the very last man. I walked in, 
Sat down, after a whole big thing there. I walked up, and I said, ""what do 
You want?"" He said, ""kid, we only got one question, have you ever been 
Arrested?""

And I proceeded to tell him the story of Alice's Restaurant Massacree with 
Full orchestration and five-part harmony and stuff like that, and other phenomenon

He stopped me right there and said, ""kid, have you ever been to court?"" And 
I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty-seven 8 x 10 colored glossy 
Pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one 

He stopped me right there and said, ""kid, I want you to go over and sit down 
On that bench that says 'Group W'""

And I walked over to the bench there, and there's Group W is where they 
Put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committin' 
Your special crime

There was all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly-lookin' people on the bench there
There was mother-rapers father-stabbers father-rapers! 
Father-rapers sittin' right there on the bench next to me! And they was mean 
And nasty and ugly and horrible and crime fightin' guys were sittin' there 
On the bench, and the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one the meanest 
Father-raper of them all was comin' over to me, and he was mean and 
Ugly and nasty and horrible and all kinds of things, and he sat down next to 
Me. He said, ""Kid, what'd you get?""

I said, ""I didn't get nothin'. I had to pay fifty dollars and pick up the garbage.""

He said, ""What were you arrested for, kid?"" and I said, ""litterin'""
And they all moved away from me on the bench there, with the hairy eyeball 
And all kinds of mean, nasty things, till I said, ""And creatin' a nuisance"" 
And they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the 
Bench talkin' about crime, mother-stabbin', father-rapin', all kinds 
Of groovy things that we was talkin' about on the bench, and everything was fine

We was smokin' cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the sergeant came 
Over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said
""Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-
Know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-
You-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-
Officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say""

And he talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he 
Said

But we had fun fillin' out the forms and playin' with the pencils on the 
Bench there

I filled out the Massacree with the four-part harmony. Wrote it down there 
Just like it was and everything was fine. And I put down my pencil, and I 
Turned over the piece of paper, and there on the other side in 
The middle of the other side away from everything else on the other 
Side in parentheses capital letters quotated read 
The following words ""kid, have you rehabilitated yourself?""

I went over to the sergeant. Said, ""Sergeant, you got a lot of god-damned 
Gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated myself! I mean I mean I 
Mean that you send I'm sittin' here on the bench I mean I'm 
Sittin' here on the Group W bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm moral 
Enough to join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a 
Litterbug""

He looked at me and said, ""kid, we don't like your kind! We're gonna send 
Your fingerprints off to Washington""!

And, friends, somewhere in Washington, enshrined in some little folder, is a 
Study in black and white of my fingerprints

And the only reason I'm singin' you the song now is 'cause you may know 
Somebody in a similar situation

Or you may be in a similar situation, and if you're in a situation like 
That, there's only one thing you can do

Walk into the shrink wherever you are, just walk in, say, ""Shrink, you 
Can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant"", and walk out

You know, if one person, just one person, does it, they may think he's 
Really sick and they won't take him

And if two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both faggots and 
They won't take either of them

And if three people do it! Can you imagine three people walkin' in, singin' 
A bar of ""Alice's Restaurant"" and walkin' out? They may think it's an 
Organization!

And can you imagine fifty people a day? I said FIFTY people a day 
Walkin' in, singin' a bar of ""Alice's Restaurant"" and walkin' out? Friends
They may think it's a Movement, and that's what it is THE Alices's
Restaurant anti-massacre movement! And all you gotta do to join is to 
Sing it the next time it comes around on the guitar

With feelin'

You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
Walk right in, it's around the back
Just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant",Alice's Restaurant Massacree,1977

And I still ain't had no sleep
She comes waItzing in the nighttime
Made of wings
She is dressed up like a bandit
With a hundred sparkling rings
Looking for my company to keep
Coming closer to me
She doesn't say a word
In the shadow of the carved rock tower
Where the sounds of the night
Were the only things we heard
In my darkest hour

She don't want to hear no secrets
She would guarantee me that
She knows there ain't no words
That can describe her
With her white silk scarves
And her black Spanish hat
She knows there ain't no way I can deny her
Yes her blue velvet perfume
Filling up the night
The guards are all asleep
That watch the tower
The moon light held her breast
As she easily undressed
In my darkest hour

Her father's in his chambers with his
Friends all gathered 'round
They are plotting their enemy's demise
With their last detail done
They await the coming sun
While I am staring in my lover's eyes
Her brothers and her sisters
Are all through for tonight
Pretending that they've just
Come into power
But she far most of all, knows that they
Can only fall
In my darkest hour

Hungry wings; their melodies
While my love awakens me
In the midst of the sunburst first light
Her hands are holding up the skies
As I hid my opened eyes
Every move just for herself
And that's so right
Soon I went along my way
With no words that could explain
As she began descending to the tower
Her safety now concerns me
Her circumstance to blame

Come all you old time cowboys
And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long
Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo.

Well I found myself in Griffin
In eighteen eighty-three
When a man by the name of Creagho
Come a'walkin' up to me
Sayin ""How do you do young fella
And how'd you like to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo"".

Well me being out of work right then
To that drover I did say
""My goin' out on the buffalo range
Depends upon the pay
But if you pay good wages,
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
On the range of the Buffalo"".

Well yes I pay good wages
And transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me
Until the season's through
But if you do get homesick
And you try and run away
You'll starve to death out on the trail
And you'll also lose your pay

Well with all the flatterin' talkin'
He signed up quite a train
Some ten or twelve in number
Of able bodied men
And our trip it was a pleasant one
Through all New Mexico
Until we crossed Pease River
On the range of the buffalo

It was there our pleasures ended
And our troubles all begun
A lightnin' storm come up on us
And made the cattle run
We got full of the stickers
On the cactus that did grow
And the outlaws waited to pick us off
In the hills of Mexico

Well the working season ended
But the drover would not pay
He said ""You spent your money boys
You're all in debt to me"".
But the cowboys never put much stock
In a thing like a bankrupt law
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach
On the range of the buffalo.

The moon must be in Aries, because the truck ain't slowing down
Pulled back on the throttle, I've been doing that all day
Looking ahead for a right-hand turn to carry me away

There's times for understanding, it don't seem like one of those
The times are too demanding when you're hanging by your nose
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me here to pray?
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise and carry me away

Carry me over the highway
Carry me over the sky
Carry me over the loneliness
That I'm feeling here tonight

You know I'm feeling just like a riptide and I'm feeling a little scared
A twisted maze of old highways, nobody has repaired
It ain't nothing that can't be handled like an actor in a play
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away

Now all of your highways, don't mean much to me no more
I've been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure
But I still get lost on all of them roads, I can't seems to find my way
I know there's one out there somewhere to carry me away

Carry me over the loneliness

I remember when I met you
Underneath the evening sky
Now it seems I could forget you
Rescue me, I'm bound to die

All the promises we made there
With no words to understand
And though I've tried I've come up empty
Heart of stone, drowning man

CHORUS:
I'm going down for the third time
And I need a helping hand
The rooster crows and I'm sinking
Heart of stone, drowning man

Where are you, my dear companion
How much longer must you be
I'm all alone out on the ocean
When will you come and rescue me

It's too late for new beginnings
In this world I've left behind
There is nothing left worth keeping
Not a thing to change my mind

CHORUS

How far down the road to glory
Must we go without a sign
Caught out on these stormy waters
How can you treat me so unkind

Did you know from the beginning
That I'd dig this lousy hole
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned
In this dark night of the soul

Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

And for myself I have no regrets
That time has taken what it soon forgets
A gambler's paradise in short vignettes

These stolen moments from the hourglass
A burning candle while the night-time lasts
Upon my pillow where my dreams float past

And all my memories seem to come alive
I think of everyone who still survives
And those who haven't may yet still arrive

I want to take the time to let you know
I've had a hard time letting feelings show
And through it all I love you even so

A poet's pleasure is to hear in time
The painter pictures what he's left behind
I close my eyes and it all leaves my mind

I sit alone and hear the sparrow sing
No way of knowing what tomorrow brings
I leave my solitude upon his wings

In the event of my demise
Be sure to include this statement
When you are bent on closing my eyes
Thinking about what my life meant

Alone on a hill back in '65
Things looked a lot like changing
Singing our songs that we harmonized
Dreaming of worlds rearranging

And I don't know why I'm singing tonight
Maybe it's time someone told you
Just because you say you've seen the light
Doesn't mean nobody sold you

I can remember all of your smiles
During the demonstrations
Taking on what seemed like the whole world
Igniting the hearts of our nations

And together we sang our victory songs
Though we were worlds apart
Every thing then has now passed away
Except for the love in my heart

Sitting at home on computerized beds
Tryine to come to conclusions
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads
Ignoring the states of illusion

Drunk in a world of material wealth
No one can notice you falling
Fantastic flights once good tor your health
Now make you deaf to your calling

And all alone the prophet groans
With words as yet unseen
Who'll be awake when the master returns
Who will be lost in their dreams

So in the event of my demise
8e sure to include this statement
Only the words of love kept alive
Are worthy of not being wasted




",Prologue,1979

Get out of bed and I'm feeling alright
Make me some coffee and I sit down alone
The rest of the day I'm on the telephone

Hang up, hold on
You got a dime so you come on so strong
Save your money and let me be
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me

I got a phone in my bedroom and one in the barn
A phone in my car and one in the yard
A phone on my saddle for when I'm out on the range
A phone in my pocket for when I'm down at the grange

Hang up, hold on
You got a dime so you come on so strong
Save your money and let me be
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me

There's a river running underground
That roll along the clay
That took my body when I laid it down
And carried it far away

It's too damned dark for you to see
So I did not protest
My soul shook free, you can't have me
But you may keep the rest

The waters weep, the sickles reap
My hands are cold with sweat
The eagle screams with frightened wings
The dust does not forget

There's a river running underground
That rolls along the clay
That tempts the sould to the ocean cold
To with the body lay

Poor Adam alone in Eden
Taking off his shoes
Tired of running around all morning
From his animal interviews

He awoke with a hand on his brow
Askign who are you
They spent the rest of their lives together
Making their debuts
Dressed in leaves and wearing blues

Some say one thing, some say two
Ain't much about it anyone can do
Keep on walking till my soles wear through
Wearing away my shoes

Evening comes and the sky turns red
Clouds of colors cover up our heads
Ain't it something just to lie here in bed
Just me and you

Oh Mary, wrapped up in glory
What are you going to tell your groom
How's he going to feel on the day of your wedding
What will your friends assume

Oh, but Joseph and Mary were married
The angels carried the news
What the Lord has joined together
The world must not undo

Thene's a wedding down at the church this morning
Let's uo wish them well
It's a beautiful day for getting married
I hope the weather lasts as well

It's been years since we've been married
I know we paid some dues
Now ain't it something just to lie here together
Just me and you
Outlasting the blues



",Wedding Song,1979
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

There's trouble all around the world
Well, it looks that way to me
People don't know what to do
They don't know where they should be

But just one question still remains
To which we must respond
Two roads lead from where we are
Which side are you on

CHORUS:
Are you on, boys
Which side are you on
Which side are you on, boys
Which side are you on

Moses crossed the desert
With a band of weary men
For forty years they wandered through
The hot and burning sand

And Moses went and prayed alone
The weary vagabond
And lightning wrote these words in stone
Which side are you on

CHORUS

Jesus stumbling through the streets
On the road to Calvary
Nailed high to testify
With other local thieves

And as they hung there dying
One asked what lay beyond
That all depends the master said
Which side are you on

CHORUS

Some men work for little things
And some men work for more
Some men work for anything
And some don't work at all

And me myself I'm satisfied
To sing for God's own son
And ask you what I ask myself
Which side are you on



",Which Side,1979
Arlo Guthrie,"I've been keeping on the run
I've been traveling with the sun
I've been singing all my life and getting by
Got to keep up with what's going on
In this place I've been so long
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life

And it's so good to come home
To a woman all alone
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

I'll be coming home at night
While the kids are sleeping tight
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine
And the kids jump out of bed
Hello Daddy, what did you get
Did you think of anything on down the line

She'll be talking with her smile
Saying, honey, wait awhile
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

Oh the prophets and the sages
And the wise men through the ages
All that's written down on pages from above
Just can't adequately describe
What I'm feeling here inside
It's just useless to be living without love

And I'll take her by her hand
Just a woman and a man
Without trying to understand what we should be
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me
",World Away from Me,1979

All my life's a circle
Sunrise and sundown
Moon rolls through the nighttime
Till daybreak comes around
All my life's a circle
Still I wonder why
Seasons spinning 'round again
Years keep rolling by

Seems like I've been here before
Can't remember when
I got this funny feeling
We'll all be together again
No straight lines make up my life
All my roads have bends
No clear cut beginnings
So far no dead ends

Above earth's lamentation.
I hear the real, thought far off hymn
That hails the new creation
Above the tumult and the strife,
I hear the music ringing;
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?

What through the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it live'th.
What through the darkness round me close,
Songs in the night it give'th.
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging.
When friends by shame are undefiled,
How can I keep from singing?",How Can I Keep from Singing?,1982

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us now won't buy a head of lettuce
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I can even glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today

CHORUS:
I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am going down to Washington D.C.
I will tell some power broker
What they did for Iacocca
Will be perfectly acceptable to me
I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am headed for that great receiving line
So when they hand a million grand out
I'll be standing with my hand out
Yes sire I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can all go
They won't have to scream and holler
They'll be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow
I'll be glad to tell them what they can do
It's a matter of a simple form or two
It's not just renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

CHORUS

Since the first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad that failure is an awful crime
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems that there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down to congress there's a safety net for you

All my bone and sinew take
Put me in the compost pile
To decompose me for a while.

Worms, water, sun will have their way,
Returning me to common clay
All that I am will feed the trees
And little fishes in the seas.

You may be having me for lunch
And then excrete me with a grin,

Oh, lord, well I kissed 'er again

Oh kisses sweeter than wine
Oh kisses sweeter than wine

He asked would I marry and be his sweet wife
Then we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
He begged daddy, pleaded like a natural man
And then, oh lord, I gave him my hand

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

I worked my day hard and so did my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to make a good life
With corn in the field and wheat in the bins
Then, oh lord, I was the father of twins

Oh

Our children numbered just about four
They all had a sweetheart knockin' on the door
They all got married and they didn't hesitate
I was, oh lord, the grandfather of eight

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

Now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
We had a lot of kids, trouble and pain

Arlo Guthrie,"If you'll gather 'round me, children,
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd,1982

Where are the songs we never got to sing

I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,

She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard

Because we know that what we do is right
All over the world

Everybody walking hand in hand
All over the world
Through the streets of Europe and Japan
All over the world
All over the world, all over the world
",All Over the World,1986
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

The sun is sinking down
I'm standing 'round my window
You say you're going away
But I believe in love

CHORUS:
The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be
You and me

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

CHORUS

But while the stars are coming out
And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

CHORUS

The sun is coming up
A rainbow on my window
You say you're going away
And even though you do

The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...
You and me




",You and Me,1986
