A place within my heart
Never been so close to you.
And if you want me to hang around then I'll never let go

And if it all goes right looking down from a birds eye view,

Until you get on my nerves
And hurt like cavity

It's not mystery
No magic trick
Let me hear this broken record again
Just press repeat

I can be your new favorite waste of time
And you'll be mine
All I want is your attention
It's all the same thing
Are you in?
What's it gonna be?
Don't roll with the punches
Make it hard for me

Can't you see I'm on the phone?

Magic's taught and history's told
A glory hole
Which through gazed her eyes of gold
Those veins run cold
Mystery's wife evades her soul
Scaring to and fro 

Tearing through the snow
As she makes her darling coat
Hoarding all the shawls
Now her evil highness rose 

Kind of like Shakespearean prose
Without the rose
Avid as she sows
Cruella grows
Horace and Jasper stole
So let the horror flow 

Black and white in hair
Elegantly gaunt in frame
A boney flare
Which christened Cruel with creepy grace
Always smokey air
Circling one lurch, Hepburn face
In her head which filled the space
Was the one hellacious taste
As she aims her fate
Nothing flees her sore embrace 

As the biggest mistake that Cruel ever made
Was when she left her cave and started to reign
As the love for her fades
Our feelings won't change
So my darling Cruella
We see through the grey 

In her cold glare
Loveliest and rare
Frightened you'll soon wear
And this elegantly haunting is so fair
There's no reason to part from her cold lair
She has all of the loveliest and rare 
Things which frighten at first
But she'll soon wear 

She's a regional spark from this nowhere
And this elegant loveliness so fair
Taking strolls through the dark by the moon's glare
As she listens for barks in the night air
Always searching for marks on the white hair 

Cruel, you're so fair

Think someone is about to be carved

To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park

In the other time of mother speed
Through evil eyes and make believe
To where we bare the supremacy mark

And never look at the other place
Stay with what's pristine that touches you
Where the peril accentuates
Something that could mean so much to you
Try save a seat in the golden cage
The media mass has still yet to say
To simply pass or rise from the grave

No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
Maybe if I look hard enough into a setting sun
I think my love will laugh with me before the morning comes

And it took me back to the festival
Where I was sure that I was gonna go

Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt.

I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay
And to think I ignored what really mattered
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great
But when I finally reached the point of giving in
I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive.

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose
That holds be to the cross but sets me free
I will glory in the power of the cross
The things I thought were gain I count as loss
And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Dean Brody,"The house was like a tomb.
I was hiding in my room.
As my brother made his way on down the hall.

I didn't want to say goodbye.
And I was trying to deny there was a war,
And that he got the call.

I watched him from my window
Walking down the drive.
Then I ran down the stairway
Through the front door and I cried

You come back you hear?
And I let him see my tears
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio.
I'll do anything you want,
Clean your room, or wash your car.
I'll do anything so long as you don't go.
But he said, this is what brothers are for.

Well I have my heroes,
But the one I love the most
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat.
And I wrote him every night,
I said I miss our pillow fights,
But lately I just wonder where you're at.

Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live.
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give.

I said you come back you hear?
I miss you being near.
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove

I'll do anything you want.
There must be someone I can call,
And just maybe they would let you come back home.
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for.

I may never have to face the anger of those guns,
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood,
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost
For him to love me that much.

Well, it had been two years,
And I held back my tears
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore.

And as I ran and held him tight,
That's when he looked me in the eye
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home.
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for.",Brothers,2009

Since I'd got to hang with you

Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sing to brown eyed girl

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line tangled
And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay

Got two maple walnut ice cream cones

I never stare nobody down
'Til one night my girl
I could not find her
She never made it back from town

I found my Shannon crying in the woods
A wicked man held her down
So I stuck him deep and I buried him good
Not deep enough to fool the hounds

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

That train stopped in Tijuana
We built a shack beneath the sun
I make my Shannon margaritas
We watch our children laugh and run, run, run

Sometimes I miss my daddy
Sometimes I miss my mom
But I think they'd be real proud of me
To know the man that I've become

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on, roll on

Shannon, why'd you run with me?

What was I supposed to do boy?
Just watch you leave?

Dean Brody,"I was watchin’ cartoons on a Saturday morning
And I heard daddy start the truck
I came runnin’ from the house and waved him down
'Cause he was makin’ a run to the dump

We watched the Bears and licked ice cream cones
Take a little walk around
I’ll never forget what my daddy said
The day we pulled that bike from the ground

He said one man’s trash is another man’s gold
If it’s thrown away it’s free to take
A little oil, she’ll be good to go
So I rode that bicycle home
Thumbs up, daddy honkin’ on the horn

I got my first job workin’ on a dairy farm
Drivin’ tractor and bailin’ hay
I’d have to circle around a bog in the ground
Where sat an old Mustang ‘68

One evenin’ I asked that farmer
Why that car was just wastin’ away
He said you can have it for free it don’t mean nothin’ to me
And I couldn’t help but think

One man’s trash is another man’s gold
What someone will throw away is a crying shame
So I towed that Mustang home
Till she could be restored
I got that engine to roar
And boy did that engine roar

It was an awkward blind date we met at a park
She had her little girl taggin’ along
A beautiful smile hadn’t been out in a while
She was a hard working single mom

In time I learned he’d left her
He said “I’m just way too young
To be having a kid, I’m not ready for this
If you keep it I’m good as gone”

He never looked back as she watched him go
She stood there crying in the rain till one January day
She had a beautiful baby girl
Tonight I tuck her in and read her stories
And hold her mama while the sunset glows

My two arms full of this man’s gold
What some men will throw away is a crying shame
Those girls make our house a home
Yeah my cup overflows
With this man’s gold

And that coyote howls, and the grizzly bear he growls.

I gave her a little hug, I said ""There's no need to cry"",

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

Not tonight
I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave 'till I see the
Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)
The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland

Last night the sky was purple and we wanted to share the view
The leaves on the trees are turning and the woods are all ablaze
The smell of the timber burning in the fireplace

Gorging ourselves on all the cider and donuts we could fit under both our arms
Picking out penny candy in the country store
Until we collapsed on the porch with our bellies sore

Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds

And tell me have you really found
The peace and calm we've all been lookin' for
Freckles still misses you, she always sleeps on the floor in your room
Ruth says she smells but you know it's just her very unique perfume

The tree in the back bore apples but they're green and full of worms
I guess we'll sit tight and wait until the cider turns
Everyone sends their love, they still don't really believe you're gone
Everyone's jealous of this crazy oddysey that you're on

Hoping this finds you happy and healthy and sane
Pray that your strength will ease you through the growing pains

Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl she sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Standing by the water fall in Paramus Park

She was working for the friends of BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup
She was looking for change and so was I
She was a Jewish girl, I fell in love with her

She wrote her number on the back of my hand
I called her up, I was all out of breath
I said, ""Come hear me play in my rock and roll band""
I took a shower and I put on my best blue jeans

I picked her up in my new V double you van
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath
I said ""Hi"", she said, ""yeah, I guess I am""

We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat

She forgot to tell me how she didn't eat meat

I had a gig in the American Legion hall
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corps
she was sitting in a corner against the wall
She would smile and I melted all over the floor

I took her home with me, we watched some TV
Annette Funicello and some guy going steady

Dean Jan,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy, my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way to Dead Man's Curve""

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away
(Dead Man's Curve) I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should've heard the whine from my screamin' machine

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
Dead Man's Curve

""Well, the last thing I remember, Doc
I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right""

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Dean Malsack,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2008

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near

Dean Malsack,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels

And did it my way

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair

And then we strolled that golden sand

And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue

Then softer than

One day, it called to you

Oh, if I could live April again
If only I could live April again
How happy I would be again

Flowers that we saved, pressed between the pages
Of the book have turned to gray
But still I close my eyes and hold them
And know that it's not April again

Dean Martin,"By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that gal so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly, call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think, I'd really leave her
Though time and time, I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know, I would really go

Dean Martin,"I've cried so much over you and I'm drowning in my tears
Oh it's no wonder I'm going under drowning in my tears
You hurt me so in many ways and I spent so many years
Walking and thinking so now I'm a sinking drowning in my tears
I keep on crying for help but you turned your back on me
I'm over my head in misery
I guess I'll go on this way 'till all of me disappears
Live in a bubble and in my trouble drowning in my tears
(I keep on crying for help but you turned your back on me)

Dean Martin,"It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Well I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some train yard
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find that you're waving from the back roads by the river of my memory
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind,1968
Dean Martin,"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted
It was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
It wouldn't die

Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
I loved her so

I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago

It would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late
'Cause I would know

That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show

And Honey, I miss you
I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day

It was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I wasn't home
When she was there and all alone
The angels came

Now all I have is memories
Of Honey and I wake up nights
And call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up

A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down in the flower bed
That Honey loved

See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted
It was just a twig

And I can see the peace pipe burning low
You criticize each little thing I do
But listen baby, I've got news for you

There's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this house
Baby I'm tired of this old game we play called cat and mouse
If you don't give just a little bit more
We're both gonna lose this race
Cause there's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this place

Trouble on our happy hunting ground
Cause you keep stepping too far out of bounds
It's hard to run this reservation right
When you stay on the warpath day and night

Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Dean Martin,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Dean Martin,"FROM LOVER TO LOSER
(Arthur Kent - Ed Warren)
Â« Â© '63 Summit Music Â»

(From lovers to losers from lovers to losers)
From lovers to losers that's me that's me
For your lips aren't willing like they used to be
You once were so hungry for my embrace
Now goodbye is written all over your face
I'm fallin' from heaven for I know we're gonna part
The fall may not kill me but it's bound to break my heart
Yes lovers to losers you made that clear
I walked in a laughing but I'm leaving with tears
I'm fallin' from heaven...

Dean Martin,"Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe?

I got a Hot Rod car and a two dollar bill
I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
And if wanna have fun come along with me

Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me?

No more lookin', I know I've been tooken
How's about keepin' steady company?

Throw my date book over the fence
Find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it till it's covered with age

But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down

But the wind blew it away
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

I haven't eaten in about a week
I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend
It's sad the shape I'm in
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got a girl waiting there for me
Well at least she said she'd be
I got a home and a big warm bed
And a feather pillow for my head
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

Well it's lonesome in this old town
Everybody put me down
I'm a face without a name
Just walking in the rain
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

That, it's Sam's song
It's not Pete Epstine's song

When home I rocket in a wink
We'll settle down at Dallas in a little low crazy palace

With some one like you in the nursery

But your lips deny they're true

Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me
Saying, ""Can't we still be friends?""

If you go, you know you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends
Am I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain?
I'm confessing that I love you, over again

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Dean Martin,"Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold 
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met 
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said ""aces is full pal how about you?"" 
He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

Time went on, I liked the game less,

Somewhere lurked a spark divine and,
I kept wond'ring whether mine
Would come to me.

Then my fortune turned and I found you,
Here you are with my arms around you.

You're the prize that Heaven has sent to me.

Wrapped up in you.

At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd

Takes me nearer to heaven
Than anyone's allowed to do

When your heart is talkin'
I feel like I'm walkin'
On a cloud
With someone like you

Someday I'll find
Someone I can boast to
Somebody to hug, a bug in a rug
To snuggle up close to

And whenever I do
Do you know the who
Who I'll give the most to?

You prey on my mind
Stay till I find
Someone like you

Someday I'll find

Somebody to hug, well a bug in a rug

Stay till I find
Someone like you

Hair that's lost some of its beauty

My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I wanna stop

Lips that are weary but tender
With love that strengthens my life
Saint in a dress made of gingham

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control in my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on earth

Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life

Do-badder up, do bother to put your foot up.
That ladder that leads you to that place.
Below and every day you lose other you.
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other.
Step ladder you climb the other way.
Scrapping and fighting, scratching and fighting,
Cheating and acting. selfish makes your heart.
Like a part of the hardest heart, so selfish.
Take it from me, don't you be a do-badder up,

I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2001
Dean Martin,"Think about me whenever you're lonely
Think about me whenever you're blue
Think about me when you have heartaches
Think about me thinking bout you
In the evening when the sun sets and blue shadows fall
All through the starry night till another day calls
I'll be a waitin' for eternity waitin' for you to return to me

Dean Martin,"I'm going to leave you some day,
But today is not the day.

You told me,if I didn't like.
The way,you lived your life.
I was free to go,and find somebody new.
So,walked out door again.
Turned around and walked back in.
There's nobody in the world for me,but you.

IÂ'm gonna leave you some day.
But today is not the day.
When the day will be,I just can't say
I'll try again tomorrow,tried it yesterday.
I'm going to leave you someday,but today is not the day.
(Instrumental)....

The suitcase has packed to go.
Everyother day or so.
But the frontdoor's the only place,it's ever been.
I bought the thing brand new.
But it's worned out for being used.
Carrying it to door and back again.

IÂ'm gonna leave you some day.
But today is not the day.
When the day will be,I just can't say
I'll try again tomorrow,tried it yesterday.
I'm going to leave you someday,but today is not the day..........

Dean Martin,"People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you

Dean Martin,"Turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Back to before that silly fight
And give me a chance to make things right

I said some things I didn't mean to
Say things that I am sorry for today
Down on my knees I beg you
Please to turn the world around the other way

I never really wanted us to break up
And I'm sorry for each teardrop that you've cried
We need to give our hearts a chance to make up
And darling will you stand in by my side

We'll turn the world around the other way
Back to where it started yesterday
Just take my hand, together
We can turn the world around the other way

Dean Martin,"When it's twilight on the trail and I jump along
The world is like a dream and the ripple of the stream is my song
When it's twilight on the trail and I rest once more
My ceiling is the sky and the grass on which I lie is my floor

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess, I was born, born that way

When it's twilight on the trail and my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath that lonesome pine on the hill

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means

Dean Martin,"There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral,
Seems there is someone at my side

[Chorus] 
Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,
The strays of long ago,
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border,
Or a band of Navajo
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?
Empty guns covered with rust
Where do ya talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do ya walk tonight?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
My tears would be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely,
As ya carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars

And let your poor heart break a little

Until the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love

We've got the world and all its charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
