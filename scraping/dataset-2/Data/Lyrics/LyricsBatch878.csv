Rammstein,"Donau quell dein Aderlass 
Wo Trost und Leid zerfließen 
Nichts Gutes liegt verborgen nass 
In deinen feuchten Wiesen 

Keiner weiß was hier geschah 
Die Fluten rostig rot 
Die Fische waren atemlos 
Und alle Schwämme tot 
An den Ufern in den Wiesen 
Die Tiere wurden krank 
Aus den Augen in den Fluss 
Trieb abscheulicher Gestank 

Wo sind die Kinder
Niemand weißt was hier geschehen 
Keiner hat etwas gesehen 
Wo sind die Kinder
Niemand hat etwas gesehen

Mütter standen bald am Strom 
Und weinen eine Flut 
Auf die Felder durch die Deiche
Stieg das Leid in alle Teiche 
Schwarze Fahnen auf der Stadt
Alle Ratten fett und satt
Die Brummen giftig allerorts
Und die Menschen zogen fort

Wo sind die Kinder	
Niemand weißt was hier geschehen
Keiner hat etwas gesehen
Wo sind die Kinder
Niemand hat etwas gesehen

Donau quell dein Aderlass
Wo Trost und Leid zerfließen
Nichts Gutes liegt verborgen nass
In deinen feuchten Wiesen

Wo sind die Kinder
Niemand weißt was hier geschehen
Keiner hat etwas gesehen
Wo sind die Kinder
Niemand hat etwas gesehen",Donaukinder [*],2009
Rammstein,"Du bist mir ans Herz gewachsen
Wenn ich blute hast du Schmerzen
Wir müssen uns kennen
Ein Körper, zwei Namen
Nichts kann uns trennen
Ein Zweileib im Samen

Wenn du weinst, geht es mir gut
Die Hand deiner Angst, füttert mein Blut

Führe mich, halte mich
Ich fühle dich, ich verlass Dich nicht

Du bist mir ans Herz gebaut
Zwei Seelen spannen eine Haut
Und wenn ich rede bist du still
Du stirbst wenn ich es will

Wenn du weinst schenke ich dir
Kinder der Angst, Tränen von mir

Wenn du weinst schenke ich dir
Die Kinder der Angst, Tränen von mir

Führe mich, halte mich
Ich fühle dich, verlass mich nicht (ich verlass Dich nicht)

Zwei Bilder nur ein Rahmen
Ein Körper doch zwei Namen
Zwei Dochte eine Kerze
Zwei Seelen in einem Herzen

Führe mich (Führe mich), halte mich (halte mich)
Ich führe dich, verlass mich nicht (ich verlass Dich nicht)

Führe mich, halte mich
Ich führe dich, ich verlass Dich nicht",Führe Mich [*],2009
Rammstein,"Ich bin jetzt anders
Sie haben mich geändert
Doch ich bin immer noch der Meinung
Es gibt zu viele Menschen

Ich kann sie nicht ertragen
Sie quälen mich mit Scherzen
Doch das Übel an Geräuschen
Ist das Schlagen ihrer Herzen

Halt, bleibt stehen
Halt, bleibt stehen
Ich kann es nicht, nicht ertragen
Halt
Hört auf zu schlagen

Seht ihr nicht, mir geht's nicht gut
Doch sie pumpen weiter Blut und
Wie sie sich vermehren, sie kommen über mich in Scharen
Ich kann sie nicht ertragen
Versuch sie auszumerzen
Es dröhnt in meine Schläfen das Schlagen ihrer Herzen

Halt, bleibt stehen
Halt, bleibt stehen
Ich kann es nicht, nicht ertragen
Halt
Hört auf zu schlagen

Stillgestanden in der Brust
Ein totes Herz ist kein Verlust
Rührt euch nicht
Niemand quält mich so zum Scherz
Ich lass' die Sonne an euer Herz

Niemand quält mich so zum Scherz
Ich bringe Licht an euer Herz
Die Entscheidung fällt nicht schwer
Ich geh jetzt Heim und hole mein Gewehr

Halt, bleibt stehen
Halt, bleibt stehen
Niemand quält mich so zum Scherz
Ich lass' die Sonne in euer Herz",Halt [*],2009
Rammstein,"Sonntag auf der Ammerwiese
Hütet Gänse brav die Liese
Da kommt Jakob angerannt,
Hält eine Sichel in der Hand

Diese schiebt er hin und wieder
Dem Lieschen unter Rock und Mieder
Er will sie kosten, will sie zwingen
Und der Bub’ wird dazu singen

Liebe Liese, lass die Gänse,
Ich will von deiner Haut probieren
Vom Blute rostig ist die Sense,
Bist du freundlich nicht zu mir

Der Jakob darf vom Lieschen lecken
Und sie wird nach Birne schmecken
Sich kleine Härchen aufgestellt,
Eilen sie zum Weizenfeld

In der Goldflut gut versteckt,
Hat er die Liese angesteckt
Hält bis zum Abend sie eng umschlungen
Und hat in das Kind gesungen

Liebe Liese lass die Gänse,
Ich will von deiner Haut probieren
Vom Blute rostig ist die Sense,
Bist du freundlich nicht zu mir

Liebe Liese, lass die Gänse,
Ich will von deiner Haut probieren
Vom Blute rostig ist die Sense,
Bist du freundlich nicht zu mir",Liese [*][Version],2009
Rammstein,"Eine Liebe, ein Versprechen
Sagte ich komm zurück zu dir
Nun ich muss es leider brechen
Seine Kugel steckt in mir
Eine Liebe, zwei Pistolen
Eine zielt mir ins Gesicht
Er sagt, ich hätte dich gestohlen
Dass du mich liebst
Weiß er nicht

Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Eine stirbt im Pulverkuss
Die zweite soll ihr Ziel nicht schonen
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust

Eine Liebe, ein Versprechen
Ach das Blut läuft aus dem Mund
Und keiner wird mich rächen
Sinnlos gehe ich zu Grund
Eine Liebe, zwei Pistolen
Einer konnte schneller ziehen
Nun ich bin es nicht gewesen
Jetzt gehörst du ihm

Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Eine stirbt in Pulverkuss
Die zweite soll ihr Ziel nicht schonen
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust

Roter Sand und weiße Tauben
Laben sich an meinem Blut
Am Ende gibt es doch ein Ende
Bin ich doch zu etwas gut

Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Eine stirbt in Pulverkuss
Die zweite soll ihr Ziel nicht schonen
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust",Roter Sand [Orchester Version] [*],2009
Rammstein,"Der Wahnsinn
Ist nur eine schmale Brücke
Die Ufer sind Vernunft und Trieb
Ich steig Dir nach
Das Sonnenlicht den Geist verwirrt
Ein blindes Kind das vorwärts kriecht
Weil es seine Mutter riecht

Ich finde dich
Die Spur ist frisch und auf die Brücke
Tropft dein Schweiß dein warmes Blut
Ich sehe dich nicht
Ich rieche dich nur ich spüre dich
Ein Raubtier das vor Hunger schreit
Witter ich dich meilenweit

Du riechst so gut
Du riechst so gut
Ich geh dir hinterher
Du riechst so gut
Ich finde dich so gut, so gut
Ich steig dir nach
Du riechst so gut
Gleich hab ich dich

Jetzt hab ich dich
Ich warte bis es dunkel ist
Dann fasse ich an die nasse Haut
Verrate mich nicht
Oh siehst du nicht die Brücke brennt
Hör auf zu schreien und wehr dich nicht
Weil Sie sonst auseinander bricht

Du riechst so gut
Du riechst so gut
Ich geh dir hinterher
Du riechst so gut
Ich finde dich so gut, so gut
Ich steig dir nach

Que hoy necesito el recuerdo matar
Sin un amigo, lejos del pago
Quiero en su pecho mi pena volcar
Beba conmigo y si se empaña
De vez en cuando mi voz al cantar
No es que la llore por que me engaña
Yo sé que un hombre no debe llorar
Si los pastos conversaran

Esa pampa le diría 
De qué modo la quería
Con qué fiebre la adoré
Cuántas veces de rodillas
Tembloroso yo me he hincado
Bajo el árbol deshojado donde un día la besé
Y hoy al verla envilecida
A otros brazos entregada
Fue pa' mí una puñalada

Y de celos me cegué
Y le juro todavía, no consigo comprenderme
Cómo pude contenerme
Y ahí no más no la maté
Tomo y obligo, mándese un trago
De las mujeres mejor no hay que hablar
Todas, amigo, dan muy mal pago

Hoy mi experiencia lo puede afirmar
Siga un consejo, no se enamore
Y si una vuelta le toca hocicar
Fuerza canejo, sufre y no llores
Que un hombre macho no debe llorar
Si los campos conversaran",Tomo y Obligo,1994

Ramón Ayala,"Un nudo en la garganta detiene mi llanto
Porque en este momento me he decidido
A olvidarte por siempre cariño santo
Y aunque sufra mucho hoy mismo te olvido

Sin reprocharte nada yo culpo a mi suerte
Por que tu naciste para ser de otro hombre
De uno que te de mucho dinero
Y pueda comprarte la mitad del mundo

Las palabras sobran en este momento
Yo que nunca tuve con que merecerte
Mi sentido adiós es para siempre
Que seas feliz y que tengas suerte

Cuando fuiste mía yo te quise mucho
Por que tu brillaste en mis horas tristes
Pero nunca supe si aquellas caricias
Eran verdad o sólo fingiste

Ramón Ayala,"Soy el mas desdichado del mundo
Y la culpa la tiene este vicio
Me dejo la mujer que tenia ahora pierdo también a mi hijo
El jamas supo lo que era un padre
Por que yo andaba siempre borracho
El pidiendo en la calle limosna
Para que yo siguiera tomando

Una noche llovió hasta el invierno
Llego el pobre hasta donde yo estaba
Y me dijo perdón papacito
Ahora si que no me dieron nada
Tengo hambre y también mucho frio
Por favor hoy no me digas nada

Pero yo ciego de tanta ira
Le golpeé hasta casi matarlo
Y le dije te vas a la calle
Ya no pienso seguirte aguantando
Ya no tienes ni casa ni padre si no traes
Para seguir tomando

Salio el pobre temblando de frio
Y llorando por lo que le dije
Mientras yo en la casa embrutecido
Sabrá Dios que tanto lo maldije

El alcohol y el sueño me vencieron
Desperté casi ya amaneciendo
Al abrir la puerta de la casa
No creí lo que yo estaba viendo

Allí estaba mi hijo tirado
Había muerto de hambre y de frio
En su mano le halle dos monedas
Que me traiga pa comprar mas vino
Y yo briago no oí que tocaba
Y así el pobre murió en el olvido

Por borracho perdí yo a mi hijo
Y a mi esposa que tanto adoraba
Yo le quiero pedir a los padres
Que no le hagan un mal a sus hijos
Tal vez dios me mando este castigo
Por tirarme a la senda del vicio",Dos Monedas,1995

Hoy me pongo mano a mano

Por cruz de mis dobles cananas
Why escriban sobre mi tumba
Mi ultimo adios con mis balas

Tiene un impedimento para esta boda
Que lo diga hoy o que calle para siempre

Mucha gente fue invitada yo también estaba
Hay nadie sabe la tristeza que sentía
Porque justo en ese día se casaba mi querer

Ella llego acompañada del padrino
La llevaba a su destino que nunca imagino
Por un momento tuve toda la ilusión
De que en aquel anillo yo le daba el corazón

A la salida de la iglesia engalanada
Ella estaba ya casada la mujer que yo adore
Entre vivas de parientes y de amigos
Me acerque para desearle fuese siempre muy feliz

Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí

Yo ya sabia, yo ya sabia
Que los besos que me dabas
Las caricias que me hacías
Tenían su signo de pesos

Haz bien la cuenta, haz bien la cuenta
No rebajes ni un suspiro
Que suspiro por suspiro
Todo te voy a pagar

Ahora robo, o ahora mato
Hoy me pongo mano a mano
Todo te voy a pagar

Haz bien la cuenta, haz bien la cuenta
No rebajes ni un suspiro
Que suspiro por suspiro
Todo te voy a pagar

Ahora robo, o ahora mato
Yo voy a ver como le hago
Todo te voy a pagar

Ramon Diaz,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Ramon Diaz,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Ramon Diaz,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Ramon Diaz,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Ramon Diaz,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1999
Ramon Diaz,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002
Ramón Leal,"Chora que a tristeza
Foge do teu olhar
Brincando de esquecer
Saudade vai passar
E amor já vai chegar

Entao canta que a beleza
Volta pra te encantar
Num sonho tao pequenho
Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Olha quantas estrelas
Nascem pra te encontrar
Depois do céu azul
A noite vai chegar
E eu pra te amar",Chora Tua Tristeza,

She was a positive sensation
The songs that she sang would never miss
My cousin was my inspiration
That`s how I got like this

I got a cousin in Milwaukee
She`s got a voice so squawky
And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
Oh, how she gets the men

Her singing isn`t operatic
It`s got a lot of static
What makes your heart get acrobatic
Nine times out of ten

When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
When she sings blue, the men shout, ""What stuff!""
That baby is hot stuff

So if you like the way I sing songs,
If you think that I`m a wow
You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
Because she taught me how

Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind.

Cause everybody has a poison heart.

He just kind of smiles, it really, shakes me up.

I take, I throw half of ya body up in the lake
Now it's time for me to break, fuck the jake
I make the street work for me

I do damage to the stage and the industry
It's like that, It's like that

[Chorus: x2]

[Rampage]
I don't mean to brag or boast
I'm the live nigga movin with toast
The playas haters in the games be cuttin it close
I'm layin low, in the phat red Testaros'

Adios from coast to coast
Iced out, flooded watch
Suade lookin like butterscotch
Stickin the city like Ed Koch

I want lands and yachts
Rockin clubs and hot spots
I want to lady that's strictly gettin paid [homey]
Not a great, to chill on the exotic island

Strictly drinkin lemonade
Rubbin my back, rubbin my head
Smellin good when she comes to bed
Victoria Secret, sumthin that I can sleep with

Pack my heat with, she's nuthin but my sidekick
The chick that I freak with
It's like that son

[Chorus: x3]

[Rampage]
I'm on the road to the riches
Naked bitches in the kitchen
Washin my dishes, leavin they man suspicious
I'm in the mansion, rightin rhymes like it's a short time

I gotta shine, sippin on fine wine
I'm in the phat jacuzzi, parle, put away the uzi
It's all about the cuties, macked out like John Belushi
Take off that versel sweater, it's gettin better

Black and white suit, Maxima, FDR coup
Been around the world, gettin loot
I got future plans in the Meadowlands
Pushin in the phat lands

Seein my mans, mad fans sittin in the stands
Goin crazy, Rampage, too young to fade
The hardcore renegade
21 songs until ya made, pre paid

Joined by crusade, I twist ya like a corn braid
I got it made, I'm blowin like the World Trade

Yo remember we was goin down to the mall
To get the juniors with some cheesecake

Yo blast what you was kickin to me, on the way to that piece
You know?

[Rampage]
I'm about to see a mill, you damn right it's real
I keep it real, from the school of the hard knocks
The brown skinned brother with dreadlocks
That's that's stickin up barber shops and jewelry shops, f*** it
Somebody gotta get dropped, that's my word on hip hop
Rampage is here to stay, I won't stop
The feds tried to get me, and were too through the cops
I'm on the streets, gotta pa** heat everyday
Before I leave my rest, yo I got to pray
My nine spray, get me caught up like boom jakes
I'm in the Bronco with my man Paco, from Puerto Rocko
It's all about the indo
Now I'm in the stereo, what's the scenario
I co rock the house and bo rump the show
a lot of MC's want to go toe with toe
You got me 6 triggered, H20, I'm been flatbushed
With my steel on the low

You way ya straight, if you did in the '98
After take two shots to the head for the waste
Six ways to split the cake, Rampage is on the tape
On the I.R.S., now put it around my chest
It's my rebel without a cause, I'm takin yours
In the river like George, just because
Sat it with salad bars and cole slaws, on ya lips
I'm a pilot, I steal ships that flips
Wit the Mo, F ya barcode
And my trunk load to unfold, I'm out to get the gold
My mission is past the globe, get ready
Rock steady, 98 to outbreak
Is it ya life that I take, is it money that I make
I cut you like beef steak

Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees

Never head wobble with fool 
Tomorrow was cruel to flock on the moon 
La La bye messaging your crew
Travel at high speeds
No ID
God on the move
Pardon me duke
Nationwide thick base collide 
The gritty groove, smash fifty-two 
And levitate your side
Who want it? 
Your back weak running like athletes
Get on it

Mu'fuckas, black out season 
Publishing resume steady increasing

Shanghai, Shanghai
New sheriff in town
Rock America's crown and hang 'em high
Who bangin' a fist full? 
Brandishing pistols
Pearl handles with the, family initials

Uh-uh, planet gets cold, get damaged for dough
Uh-uh!, Savages off balance and blow traveling slow
Uh-uh!, in effect mode, y'all niggas know it

Sayonara, send my rivals, slam a guy, 
Be damned if I
Had to tell one, tell a lie, get paralyzed 
Stay payed, rock shit made in ultra suede 
Switch blade yo wack act back to first grade 
Even if y'all never seen us you know y'all need us
Suck my penis from here to muthafucking venus
Think back when you was amazed and had to sit back 
Imagining me ending your world like Deep Impact
Blood clot, watch me come through and bust a gunshot
Yeah people, come inside of your dance and done that

Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

Kill the bitch while she ain't even looking
Still all fucked up from the last ass-whuppin

Uh, straight off the bat
My squad is known across the map
When y'all niggas show love then we show you love back
y'all niggas want beef
Fuck it take it to the streets
y'all niggas gon chill
Then we sit down and we build
My squad finally here
Unit of the year
We settin up shop and we ain't going nowhere
We want it all
Even if we gotta brawl for it
We want it all
Even if you gotta fall for it
We stage wreckers
Fifty-two car deckers
Reppin to the world till the law come and get us
You jealous fellas
I'm puttin holes in vendettas
Twist your body
With two shells from a shottie POW!

[Baby Sham]
Niggas want to get me touched
(Naw they can't touch you)
Shinin and flossin too much
(Naw they can't cross you)
Light on my toes
Left him ten feet
Part from his heat
Play it softly
The truth speaks through this poetry
For me to call shot
Cock block my life
Add a little spice
Devil eyes snake rise on dice
Have your fam call christ
Flipmode battle for mics
All my shit be high priced
I'm slashing dikes
Feel me
Liftin thugs out they crease it's quickly
Shift two keys in two weeks
And gross forty g's
Report me
And live shortly
Slouch cat livin off calibil breeze
You want to get involved
Better grip on tight
Take the next flight
We got it locked on the next bike

[Rampage]
Check it out
I got the eye of a tiger
That's plan to go higher
My squad is on fire
And till death do us
If the label want to sue us
Yo I'm taking the reels
I'm the man with the gat that be ready to peel
I'm the one next to Spliff when it's time to ill
I'ma show by astro red cross and blue shields
Watch us make a move
Catch us on smokin groove
Rules house of blues
MTV News
On the bus with my Flipmode loco (loco)
Takin flicks
Hittin chicks by the dozen (dozen)
Keep a shot runnin
Now I'm on a journey
It take you twenty light years to burn me (burn me)
If you want beef call my attorney
All that other wack shit don't concern me
I'm being felt
I got a title under my belt
I'm out to get the wealth
I'm bout my squad and myself

CHORUS

[Rah Digga]
Uhh
Comin correct for all my Flipmode brothers
Stats ratin higher then that of single mothers
Peace to my Outz clique
Bitches that I bounce with
Everybody else get the gas like Auschwitz
Like, flows for real like a rap bitch should
Type takin niggas out like they packaged goods
Rappers want to contest

Straight up and down we run the underground like H. Tubman
What, I'm the bomb bitch

Witness

I be spittin more verses than the Book of Job

[Busta Rhymes]
Why are you ignoring us
Running into hiding and avoiding us
Niggas on the low be recording us
My rhyme flow remain poisonous
Thus
Yo your shit sound wack still annoying us
We alive nigga ain't no destroying us
You better off if you come join with us
Perpendicular
Or analyzing my whole molecular
In particular
Roll with my squad or go singular
I ain't into bitches who fuck animals like caligula
More hot shit so get your water sprinkler
Fire extinguisher
Rhyme prime minister
C'MON!
Never mistake me for nobody else
Another blast make you shit on yourself
I hope all y'all know that I always master the art
Rip you apart
Put your hand on my heart
Flipmode number one on the charts
Solo or collective
My perspective the objective
Is to win
All praises due to my squad one in the same
Cherish every blessing I have to make y'all witness my name
Burn another calorie
Come inside my galaxy
Put your money where your mouth is double your salary
Hey dude you know we stay rude high on a aquelude
Bust your shit bouncin in a Honda Prelude
Let's G off
Nigga ease off
I make you breeze off
Brickfull make you rip your jeans off

CHORUS",To My People,1998
Rampage,"Yeah, where you think you goin'. Where you think you goin'.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the unit for the 9-8.
Flipmode Squad baby. That's my word.
All you sucker MC's, try to hide this stuff. Come back here.
Where you think you goin', nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein' Jack. Shit !!!

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

[Chorus]
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you movin for.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

[Chorus]

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.
Now we coppin' platinum things.
Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.
Ramp's the rugged MC.
My squad keeps growin.
Where you think you goin.'

Chief gunnin' to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.
Now low muscles moves.
Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.
Son gets school, wit the dummin' crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn
Like James Evans when I'm blowin'.
Fuck is wrong wit cha.

Where you think you're goin'.
Where you think you're goin'.

Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, sinc the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O.
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo

Hahahaaa!  I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
So my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
Like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless

Many niggas want to know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm getting phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST niggas shit!
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and

People always asking me, how your shit be selling
For making shit guaranteed to bust your fucking melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no telling, when I was striking had you swelling
Cruising in my Lands, watch the police how they be gelling
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smelling
Yo fuck that!  You best believe there ain't no time for dwelling
If you ain't makin noise you need to kill the fucking yelling

Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
Your lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin five in The Source

I be saddle back biting motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss

Hey yo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.
Now I'm writing rhymes hitting shorties everyday
In the full running drinking ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fillet
Now I'm knocking out niggas from, to, touche!
Now I'm going back around the way
I'm ripping shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye

Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggas open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chicken head, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton

It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Fixx
Sticking to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggas open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'

Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Every time I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breaking fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Hey yo, I see intruders on my scan
Singing at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland

Rampage The Last Boy Scout,"Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife


Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

In neon en natrium licht
De stad is een kermis van kleur
De stad verandert steeds haar gezicht
Steeds een ander gezicht
Steeds opnieuw jouw gezicht, jouw gezicht

Ik beleef in deze uren
Steeds weer nieuwe avonturen

In de armen van de stad
In mijn armen
Kom, ik wacht al zoveel uren
Op het grote avontuur
En in jouw armen vind ik dat
De liefde kan niet altijd duren
In de armen van de stad
In de armen van de stad

De liefde is als regen op mijn huid
Maar mijn koel gevoel dat mij omsluit
Laten we gaan hier uit
Hier ver vandaan
Ver weg, samen met jou
Laten we gaan, laten we gaan, laten we gaan

De stad lokt met duizenden stemmen
Van mensen alleen in de nacht
De stad zingt een lied met hun woorden
Er is altijd weer een ander die wacht
Steeds een ander die wacht
Steeds ben ik het die wacht
Op jou wacht

Ik wil verder gaan en dwalen
Door steeds andere verhalen
In de armen van de stad
In mijn armen
Ik wil nachtenlang verdwalen
In de stad van jouw verhalen
In jouw armen wil ik dat
Ik wil altijd verder dwalen
In de armen van de stad
In de armen van de stad

De ochtend glijdt stil over me heen
De lucht wordt wit en wijd
Ik ben alleen, waar ben jij
Waar waarheen, jij bleef toch daar
In de stad, ik blijf alleen
Jij blijft bij haar
Ik blijf alleen
Jij blijft bij haar

Alle klokken kan ik horen
Als haar hartslag in mijn oren

In haar armen

Heb ik jou voorgoed verloren

Ramses Shaffy,"Mijn hemel blauw met gouden harp
Mijn wolkentorens, ijskristallen
Kometen, manen en planeten, aah alles draait om mij
En door de witte wolkenpoort tot diep onder de golven
Boort mijn vuur, mijn liefde, zich in de aarde
En bij het water speelt een kind
En alle schelpen die het vindt gaan blinken als ik lach

'k Hou van je warmte op mijn gezicht
Ik hou van de koperen kleur van je licht
Ik geef je water in mijn hand
En schelpen uit het zoute zand
Ik heb je lief, zo lief

Ik scheur de rotsen met mijn stralen
Verhoog de meren in de dalen en
Onweersluchten doe ik vluchten, aah als de regen valt
Verberg je ogen in een hand
Voordat m'n glimlach ze verbrandt
M'n vuur, m'n liefde, mijn gouden ogen
't Is beter als je nog wat wacht
Want even later komt de nacht en schijnt de koele maan

De nacht is te koud, de maan te grijs
Toe neem me toch mee naar je hemelpaleis
Daar wil ik zijn alleen met jou
En stralen in het hemelblauw
Ik heb je lief, zo lief

Als ik de aarde ga verwarmen
Laat ik haar leven in m'n armen
Van sterren weefde ik het verre, aah het noorderlicht
Maar soms ben ik als kolkend lood
Ik ben het leven en de dude
In vuur, in liefde, in alle tijden
M'n kind ik troost je, kijk omhoog
Vandaag span ik mijn regenboog
Die is alleen voor jou

Nee nooit sta ik een seconde stil
'k Wil liever branden neem me mee
Geen mens kan mij dwingen wanneer ik niet wil
Wanneer je vanavond gaat slapen in zee
Geen leven dat ik niet begon
En vliegen langs jouw hemelbaan

Als ik je aankijk, heb ik nergens meer greep op
Ik swing door de straten als een discodanser
Ik sta voor je, trillend van dankbaarheid
Mateloos stroom ik over, mateloos

En dan in bad, lach niet, ik kus je voeten over en weer
Je haalt adem alsof je slaapt, maar je slaapt niet
Ik zeg hardop: Wat ben jij prachtig
Je schiet in een lach omdat ik vroeger
Een liedje heb gemaakt over twee deftige
Oude dames in het bad, die tegen elkaar zeien
Wat zijn wij prachtig
Wat zijn wij prachtig allebei
We komen niet meer bij

Dan zijn we stil, je beroert me
Ik kus je voeten een eeuwigheid
We steken het licht aan en nemen een sigaret
En kleden ons aan om ergens wat koffie te drinken
Om op de tramhalte stil tegen je aan te staan
Met gesloten ogen de auto's voorbij te horen gaan
En de stemmen van mensen, voetstappen, de fietsen
Stil tegen je aan te staan in eeuwigheid

Om dan later een beetje lachend
De eerste de beste zijstraat in te slaan
Om dan in bed stil tegen je aan te liggen met open ogen
Je vindt me een klein jongetje
Je aait m'n neus, m'n hoofd, m'n haar
Stil tegen je aan te liggen in eeuwigheid

Je maakt grapjes tegen me dat je straks
Een boterham met pindakaas klaar zult maken
En morgen mag ik naar de speeltuin
Want eens zul je er niet meer zijn
Een eeuwigheid stil naast je te liggen
En tot die tijd wil je me alles geven

Als ik je aankijk, heb ik nergens meer greep op
Ik adem je in tot ik niet meer kan

Deserve expressions that really fit you

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

An airline ticket to romantic places

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,

Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Ramsey Lewis,"Some would rather go it all alone
And never spend time finding where their heart belongs
Some prefer to love and leave not wanting to reveal
A feeling deep inside, a love that could be real

For some this is okay but I can't sleep one night
Without your precious love around me

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever in love

Many say that love's a silly game
But when I'm playing love with you it never ends
And when I'm feeling all my days aren't going right
You shine your light of love and brighten all my nights

And that's why I love you 'cause I can't sleep one night
Without your precious love around me

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming

[Bahamadia] 
I'm mystical; don't be deceived by the visual 
Visible preference is pure; patent it back to metaphors 
Greetin' 'em Illa del style wild 
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on eight, four poetic meter 
Soarin' way beyond 
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam 
Unsyncopated soul, piercin' earlobes and egos 
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore? 
To the grain

[Guru] 
Lame-game, plain-Jane emcees can't approach these 
I shake chumps like fleas; I hold the keys 
To drive you, guide you, provide you 
With the real joints; ahem, I clear my throat of phlegm 
The architect, selecting the blueprints 
To rid the game of nuisance 
Sucker reducin' with the fusion 
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution 
Stackin' concrete flows; look out below 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles 
Most emcees couldn't see me with bifocal spectacles 
There's no protectin' you; with realness, I'm wreckin' you 
I'm beggin' you - take a look into the cipher 
You're dirt on my windshield, so I'm turnin' on my wipers 
And I can see clearly now 
No other rapper is near me 
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

[Bahamadia] 
Never flip folklores, only realness 
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck 
Respect the architect in this division 
Rhymes written to be hittin' like anti-proton collisions 
Rap newest edition, bringin' the feminine in renditions 
In rare form, defined as optimal for my pedigrees 
In skill three like three-sixty degrees as in well-rounded 
Leavin' the competition dumb-founded 
For when I catch wreck, I astound 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Floor to ceiling, constantly building 
With power to construct towers of rap cream, kid; what? 
Dreamin' you're lyrical, physical, mystical? 
Your concept's mediocre, plus you're way too typical withcha 
Corny delivery and crazy, whack voice 
Mad corny image; that's why I give you jitters 
It figures I'd have to dust you off the scene 
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean

[Bahamadia] 
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate 
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create 
Top notch and on lock like Sentry; opponents could never tempt me 
Samplin' my style like an Akai S-950, and still can't get with me 
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic 
Conductin' phonics like the Philharmonics 
I make in measured melody; kids praise me like the crucifix 
So place Bahamad' amongst your top ten of emcees 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

Ramsey Lewis Trio,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,

I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick Out of You,1995

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1995

Rance Allen,"Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, son of God, Jesus

Springtime, springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
Jesus, Jesus

In the world, things have changed
Look around, all I see is pain
And through it all one thing's the same
I still believe the power of your name (your name)

I was sick deep in my soul
I needed someone to make me whole (make me whole)
I let Jesus take control
You see, I'm not crazy and I want you all to know

Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus

Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
Jesus, Jesus

You've given up and walked away
God's not real, some people say (some people say)
But when troubles come and the sky is gray
Everybody gets real deep now and wants to pray

But why wait 'til your money's gone?
Lose your house, job and you're all alone
Call his name and it won't be long
'Til you feel that fire vanish, shot up in your bones

And this is what we hear
Through the dark and through our fears
And even though the world may change
It is still the sweetest name

Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, son of God, Jesus

Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
It is the love between him and I

When I'm in trouble (Jesus)
'Bout to lose my mind (Jesus)
I call on Jesus
And he steps in on time

(Ain't nobody like, Jesus)
There is a name I love to hear (Jesus)
Soothes my doubts (Jesus)
Calm my fear (Jesus)

Who talk about their picks
And they talk about all the wins of the great jock leftgit

This is not Churchhill downs this is not Hollywood Park
When the field is wide open
I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart
Every time I come back to the east bay I run into ""big L""
My old friend Big L he's not doing so well
Me and Big L grew up across the freeway from the track
WE spent may days at the track
I see Big L come rollin up the street
On his little sister's pink ten speed
He said ""Tim, Tim don't you remember me?"" 
""way back from 1973?""
Every time I se him he has to remind me
Like I would ever forget Big L
Then he's gone
Like a flash
Then he's gone
Like a flash
Yeah like a flash

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2004

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,2004

If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
