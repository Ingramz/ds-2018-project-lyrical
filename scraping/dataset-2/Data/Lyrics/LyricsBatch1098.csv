The Black Maria,"Rats

Rats in the prison
Sentenced to obey
Broken by the slaves
Masquerading beyond the lights

I am constantly in wonder
What kind of an animal can live in this filth
And you, you're the kind of cheap whore
Who's forever been living for
Sucking the life out of me

We're rats in the prison
For one last hopeless day
The glass tomb's not escapable
Forever buried in it's grave

I am constantly in wonder
What kind of an animal can live in this filth
And you, you're the kind of cheap whore
Who's forever been living for
Sucking the life out of me

Rats, rats, rats, rats
Rats, rats, rats, rats
Rats, rats, rats

I am constantly in wonder
What kind of an animal can live in this filth
And you, you're the kind of cheap whore
Who's forever been living for
Sucking the life out of me

I am constantly in wonder
What kind of an animal can live in this filth
And you, you're the kind of fucking whore
Who'll sell your heart and soul for a dollar bill

Rats
",Rats in the Prison,2005
The Black Maria,"Smothered you suffocate,
Choke on me,
Confused you isolate all your intensions,
There's no vaccination...

Gardens that burn from fires,
Evacuate the Angels,
Who stand on funeral pyres,
To escape temptation,
Nothing has been consistent,
Not your life or your vision,
When two hearts burn as one,
Who is the victim?

You're my siren,
Entice my heart 'til it's yours,
You're my siren,
Entice my heart 'til it's yours

These bars are getting to me,
This gray box so isolating,
I've paced in it everyday,
For too long it's been my sentance...

You're my siren
Entice my heart 'til it's yours,
You're my siren,
Entice my heart 'til it's yours

Enjoy your time inside my mind and heart they're yours
Enjoy your time inside my mind and heart they're yours
Enjoy your time inside my mind and heart they're yours

You're my siren,
Entice my heart 'til it's yours
You're my siren,
Entice my heart 'til it's yours

This is yours,
This is yours,
This is yours,
This is my heart",Sirens,2005
The Black Maria,"Close your eyes and just let go
And find the beauty outside of your front door
You've been lost in the dark
Inside your apartment with a broken heart
Because it hurt too much to let go

And you have lost all your self-control
You wake up miserable
A broken heart in a box you buried away
Six feet under to get rid of all the pain

Because it hurts too much to let go
Of the life you always have known
You've been lost in yourself
Your imagination is a crippling hell
To have loved is to let go

And you have lost all your self-control
You wake up miserable
A broken heart in a box you buried away
Six feet under to get rid of all the pain

You have lost all control
You wake up miserable
A broken heart in a box you buried away
Six feet under to get rid of all the pain

You said you'd never change
And you can't seem to bring us back to the place of
Where we first started from
And you swore that you'd never leave and forever be
Mine and that you'd die beside me
So where are those forgotten promises now?

You have lost all control
You wake up miserable
A broken heart in a box you buried away
Six feet under to get rid of all the pain

You have lost all control
You wake up miserable
A broken heart in a box you buried away
Six feet under to get rid of all the pain

My light is my hope that won't stop burning
For a love that is more than just a passing thing
How long? How much more?
How long? How long will this take?
",To Have Loved,2005
The Black Maria,"Don't say goodbye
'Cause I'm still right here
And don't you give up
My love for you
Is stronger than this

I'm a tightrope walker
And a vagabond poet
Who was killed
For an artist's guilt

Time will disappear
And kill you
Without any conscience
But I'll still always be here

You know I know how much
This hurts you my dear
Just give it time
I promise we'll meet again

I'm a tightrope walker
And a vagabond poet
Who was killed
For an artist's guilt

Time will disappear
And kill you
Without any conscience
But I'll still always be here

The highway is a ghost town
And the roads are paved with glass
The moon is our spotlight
And the stars our final crowd

There's blood in the backseat
And our screams the only sound
And soon they'll be nobody here
",11:11,2006
The Black Maria,"Shots ring out like a bell
As they're running away from the scene
The sweat leaking down to my pillow
Makes it so much harder and harder to sleep

The blast gets a little bit louder
To the point that it's deafening
To see the last of the undead soldiers falling faster
And faster down to their knees

Wake up, do you believe in this honestly?

This is a call to arms, revenge is ours
We need to destroy the songs
That feed the beast in the radio
That spread like a gas leak in suburban homes

Shackled and ready to go
My army sounds like a symphony
A chant and a screaming war siren
Makes it so much harder for you to sleep at night

The blackout of an industry full of tyranny
The blackout of an industry
Is what we need to bring them down
To their knees

This is a call to arms, revenge is ours
We need to destroy the songs
That feed the beast in the radio
That spread like a gas leak in suburban homes

Wake up, turn it off
This is a breakout and the inmates are about to revolt
Take it back and take it back for good
Do you believe in this honestly?

This is a call to arms, revenge is ours
We need to destroy the songs
That feed the beast in the radio
That spread like a gas leak in suburban homes

Because this is a call to arms
",A Call to Arms,2006
The Black Maria,"


So take a minute and ask yourself why
Every second you're after just seems to pass.
Take a minute and ask why you ran away from it.
And every moment, thereafter, is a relapse.
From the memory before to the one that just passed.
Take a minute and ask yourself why.
It's easier to appease me when you are down on your knees,
And you're begging for me.
To take it easy on you, it's easier to
Leave you when you're down...

These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Yesterday seemed so long ago,
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Why do you face this alone?

So now you've watched the playback in your mind.
Would you agree that you let it all slip past?
I just had to ask why it got away from you.
Does every regret burn from the inside?
From the memory before to the one that just passed,
Watch it again and ask yourself why?
It's easier to appease me when you are down on your knees and alone.

These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Yesterday seemed so long ago,
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Why do you face this alone?

These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Yesterday seemed so long ago,
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Why do you face this alone?






",The Concubine,2006
The Black Maria,"


There's a machine in my head.
There's a grinding in my brain.
The best part is that it turns you on.
The grinding penetrates
Under the sheets, my dear.
We lie in love, but with fool's gold.
I want to give you the plans
Just to make you stop.
I want you to get out of here for good.
It's in my bed, but my bed is a plot.
And the shovel is anchored down to the floor.

And I won't need to see you pushing up dirt again.
And I won't need to see you gagging on sincerity.
Daylight kills us.
KO'd by it and counting to ten.
Faced with choices
To pack it in or stand up and fight again.

There's something in my hand
Pushing into my veins.
The tablature is for a death march.
I can't miss you
Because you're already gone.
This is the climax to our love song.
You're in my head, but gone for good.
Your sonnet's melody plays on.

And I won't need to see you pushing up dirt again.
And I won't need to see you gagging on sincerity.
Daylight kills us.
KO'd by it and counting to ten.
Faced with choices
To pack it in or stand up and fight again.

We lie in love but with fool's gold.






",Fool's Gold,2006
The Black Maria,"


Paralyzed between these metal walls.
And how I wish I had something more than this.
Is this success?
'Cause when I'm home, it's just another day.
A piece of the furniture with nothing to say.
Your jester who lives to fail.

Everything that was written by me is complicated.
I swear I give you my words.
They get mixed up sometimes,
And everything that was written by me,
What's the meaning? I swear I give you my words.
They get lost sometimes.

Oh, it's cute to kiss and tell.
But the craziest part is that you all will never know for sure,
Did I mean it all?
Any part at all?
They lyrics are just a fragile wall to keep me guarded from you.

Everything that was written by me is complicated.
I swear I give you my words.
They get mixed up sometimes,
And everything that was written by me,
What's the meaning?
You think you see it, the words.
They get lost sometimes.

Oh, how I bleed for you.
I wear my heart on my sleeve.
I live and bleed for only you.

With everything that was written by me,
You'll never see it,
You'll never get it.
This world gets me down sometimes...






",Living Expenses,2006
The Black Maria,"


I stocked up on the ropes and the chains.
Can we keep things together now?
My mind is a broken shell and the last pieces
Are covering the bathroom...
Which way to the door.
I'm being chased by doctors.

Lucid and tranquil.
I've got my sanity.
Everything I ever was in mapped out on the whiteboard,
For everyone and anyone.
Someone please show me the door.

To sanctity my sanctuary
Is hidden deep inside from most.
And the secrets in the locket I wear,
They've been prescribed by doctors.
I need more.

Lucid and Tranquil.
I've got my sanity.
Everything I ever was is mapped out on the whiteboard,
For everyone and anyone.
Someone please show me the room.
Where I lost my innocence
Into a vacuum of paranoid secrecy.
Is everybody after me?
Someone please show me more,
Show me more...






",Lucid,2006
The Black Maria,"Your beauty forced a change in me
Vivid and pure, it will always be haunting me
Burnt out by the temptress of old
Reborn, you're constantly challenging me

It never seemed so easy
For you to put me back together again
Lost in your eyes, the time flies by
Soon I'll be gone, left without a trace
I need you, to put me back together again

I ache for you constantly
Through my veins, I yearn for you hopelessly
And when it's my time to go
If all else fails, I desperately want you to know

It never seemed so easy
For you to put me back together again
Lost in your eyes, the time flies by
Soon I'll be gone, left without a trace
I need you, to put me back together again

Have I ever been so scared to be lost without a trace?
My heart broken in two, your memory erased
I'm so scared to be alone, you made me whole

I will always miss you
You will always have a place inside my heart

You make me whole
",Nothing Comes Easy but You,2006
The Black Maria,"This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear, it may just change my mind

That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

The scent of your perfume left me consumed
And every promise that you made
Were they pure and true?

'Cause when I looked beyond the mattress
I saw you for what you really were
And from that moment you've been a stranger and I've been a fool

This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear, it may just change my mind

That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

There's a contract in a shoe box
And a ring that comes with a veil
You've shattered all my dreams, you're a liar too

With there being so many ghosts inside
My stored past that haunts me
Will I be the one destroyed after this?

Is it a sign of weakness
Can't do it anymore
I was drowning in the ocean
Now I'm floating to the shore

You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures

This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear, it may just change my mind

That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures

Your desperation
Your inspiration

When you finally became a mute,
While a sad song plays,
You lie helpless and lost,
Infected by the truth
That was fabricated by you.
Your image shattered in the eye of the storm.
We would never reach out to you.
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out.
You're fooling yourself.
Your inspiration is your contradictions.
You've lost the concept of what's the real truth.

That it's you who is the thief.
Who should by humbled by the
Sheer size of your crimes.
We befriended you.
It was abuse.
There's no better time then the present time
To finally forget you.
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out.
You're fooling yourself.
Your inspiration is your contradictions.
You've lost the concept
Of what's the real truth.

Close your eyes, and pretend that it's alright.
Do you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?
It's all crashing down.

Lately you know you've seen it.
The face, in the mirror never lies.
You're fading.
Fading...






",A Thief in the Ranks (Your Bike),2006
The Black Maria,"Give away all that you have inside
Every last moment that you're alive
Until your body is cold
Sure, as he peels away your skin
You see the monster is intent
To see this to the end

it would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

life has been keeping you awake
Asphyxiated by the hate
And it never calms
Sew the aching in your veins
That no one ever sees
With the blade in the sheets

it would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

it's over...it's over
Except the scars that last forever

it would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

Heads held high we defy everything that you demand.
Don't try to fake your way again, we can see through your disguise.
Don't try to snake away again, we will find out where you hide.

If you can't find a reason to believe
The lies that make up all their promises.
They're tearing at the seams, and all we see are broken dreams,
So say, no not today, no not today.

This is our fight, this is our right, this is where wake ourselves,
To the truth, and remove the grip that you once held.

Sell up, sell out to scrape your way ahead.
Get up, get out and pay your way again.
Put up, put out to raise you from the dead.
Sell up, sell out, now we're seeing fucking red.

The lies that make up all their promises.

The Blackwood Brothers,"Amazing Grace ! How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind but now I see.

In evil long I took delight,
Unawed by shame or fear
Till a new object met my sight,
And stopped my wild career.

3. I saw one hanging on a tree,
In agonies and blood
Who fixed his languid eyes on me,
As near his cross I stood.

4. Sure, ne’er until my latest breath,
Can I forget that look
It seemed to change me with his death,
Though not a word He spoke.

5. My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair
I saw my sins his blood had shed
And helped to nail Him there.

6.Alas, I knew not what I did,
But all my tears were vain;
Where could my trembling soul be hid,
For I the LORD had slain.

7. A second look He gave that said;
“I freely all forgive” !
This blood is for my ramson paid,
“I died that thou mayest live.”

8. Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

9. Through many dangers,toils and snares,
I have already come;
Tis Grace hath bro’t me safe thus far,
And Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
His will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yes! when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the vail,
A life of joy and peace.

12. The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But GOD who called me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

13. When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise,
Than when we first begun!",Amazing Grace,1998
The Blackwood Brothers,"Some people steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on the Judgment Day
That gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a deep dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world, in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not pure and true
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world, in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

The Blackwood Brothers,"I see a bridge a way to cross the River of Strife River of Strife
I'm not smart I'm not strong many needs I called were wrong
And my heart is often drear when troubles appear
But when the night is dark and long oh how peaceful is the dawn
I see a bridge a way to cross all trouble and strife all trouble and strife
When the valley I must cross is so dark I lose my way
When the river is so wide I'd rather stay
I see a bridge straight and wide standing o'er the raging tide
I see a bridge a way to cross all trouble and strife all trouble and strife)
As I journey through this life its days and its nights
I know I must cross dark and lonely valleys
For at times the path is so dim I can hardly find my way
And great rivers of trials and tribulations
Will cross the narrow road that I feebly travel
But I will feel no danger for I'm never alone nor forsaken
With faith I shall look up and see a bridge
Yet there will always be a way provided for my escape

And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Till we gather in Heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

If we never meet again this side of Heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life
(Where the charming roses bloom forever)
(And where separation comes no more)

If we never meet again this side of Heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Oh, they say we shall meet by the river
Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in Heaven
In the wonderful sweet by and by

No I don't expect this last favor for nothing cause you're a busy man my friend
So look on the end of the handle you'll find attacked two tens

There's a phone number on the back of the shovel of a dear friend of days gone by
Call her and tell her to bring her sister I've already gave them two tens to cry

I carry this with me for two reasons the last so I never was broke

So please buy some pretty flowers in my right pocket is my last two tens

The Blackwood Brothers,"It was a stylish congregation you could see they'd been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the Amen Corner of that church sat Brother Ira
And he insisted every Sunday on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he'd get behind and miss the words
Well at last the storm cloud burst and the church was told in vine
That Brother Ira must stop his singing or the choir was gonna resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
And they got their big fine car and drove up to Ira's door
They found the choir's great trouble sittin' in an old arm chair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow white hair
Said York we're here dear Brother with the best res approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now it was our understanding when we bargained for the chair
That they were to relieve us that is they'd do the singin' for us
Now we don't want no singin' except what we've bought
The newest tunes are all the rage the old ones stand for nought
And so we have decided are you listenin' Brother Ira
You'll have to stop your singin' it's messin' up our choir
The old man raised his head a sign that he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I've sung the songs of David nearly eighty years said he
They've been my staff and comfort all along life's dreary way
I'm sorry if I disturbed the choir I guess I'm doin' wrong
But when my heart is filled with praise I can't hold back a song
I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
Yes I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
I wonder if they'll kick me out up there for singin' in Heaven's choir
A silence filled the little room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ira was dead
Oh the choir missed him for a while but he was soon forgot
And a few church goers watched the door but the old man entered not

Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in)

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

It's not somebody who's seen the light

NOWHERE!


I don't always recognize me

Not even my own face

I can't take the ups and downs

So I have to take these pills


And the lights go off

And then I turned around

I got to see your face

As you were falling away

And you looked just like me


I've disconnected

I'm standing in the middle of nowhere

Where nothing's real

I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere


There are some things I just can't control

They're so deep within

And just when I feel I'm ok

And you pretend you're me


And the lights go off

I got to see your face

As you were falling away

I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere at all

There's something wrong

I can't feel the insides of my life

There's something wrong

I'm lost in the middle of nowhere at all

Don't promise anything

Put the money in the body bag
Right in front of us

With every crippled word you said to me
With every fractured breath and broken glare
You were pawning off your babies' debt with a cold paycheck

Abandon what you built, repair your hope with guilt
There's nothing left here to suffocate
With razor wire arms you reach and miss the throat
There's nothing left to love about this city anymore
The politics and the hired whore

Now, save your breath

You can't repair the punctured lung
Secrets seep through the stress cracks

Shut your mouth,[Incomprehensible] shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
You did this to yourself
Now shut your mouth and pay the rent
Shut your mouth and pay the rent

Are cut-throats down in the Port of Spain
White-knuckled at the rains
His timbers wail in shame

See me wistful in some harbor bar
I tend the warm glass and the duelling scar
I sing my misappropriation song
For lovers land-locked far too long

Oh, angel baby
I lapping on a blue romance
For cargo and by compass
With a serpent’s tail in chance

Through the forties and the trades
And a cutlass raised in rage
Just for cotton and tobacco
For whiskey and for gage

Take the whip to drive the sugar train
A scent plantation and banana rain
I sing my misappropriation song
For lovers land-locked far too long

The streets are skipping records blaring hiss.
Camouflage, camouflage.

The taxis are jaguars throwing fits.
Subways are subterranean bullets.
Camouflage, camouflage.
The city's draped in camouflage.

She says give me one good reason not to empty the heart of all its zeros and ones,
Not to smash that telecaster before it births a thousand useless slums.
Love bit you in the throat while you were staring at the sea.
All the girls in Montreal are smashing skateboards in the street.
It?s 4am and she's at your door with a suitcase, in a nightgown.
We slip through mansions with fences full-grown.
We slip through streetlights in crooked rows.
I saw the sky split in two: one half jealous and one half cruel.
I felt my chest cave in under a pile of synthetic grins.
The fields are day-glo under sobbing rainbows dragged through filthy thoughts,
False applause and camouflage.
I couldn't see the solar system,
It was camouflaged as a tape loop repeating.
I couldn't see the glorious meadow,
It was camouflaged as a smashed in glass window.
I couldn't see the love and affection,
It was camouflaged as a jungle of erections.
I couldn't see the skeletal lightning,
It was camouflaged as a young machete.

His guts are stuffed with polaroids, and they're all humiliating.
And when the wine's drunk and the wild cabaret has sung it's last voice,
And you're sitting all alone in the 4am darkness of a pitch-black theater,
He explodes like fireworks on the stage with gold smoke.
Sing, your voice just won't stop blooming.
He wrote a play and you're the protagonist.
All the girls you wish you'd fucked make a guest appearance.
Oh, and you just won't believe the ending.

The giant swan's got a pixelated beak.
His eyes are twin mushroom clouds,
His feathers are unsuspecting cities,
And his breasts are hollow apartments with the highest quality furnishings.
And you can watch tv until you die there, deflated skin draped over luxury chairs.
Sing, your voice just won't stop blooming.
If your heart's a diamond, buddy, what's the price?
If your heart's a diamond what's the fucking price?
Your mouth is cheap and your hair is shoddy.
So sit and watch the ballerinas kick and spin.
Then strip down to your vulgar skeleton.
You'd better take one more drink of captain morgan's rum.
Oh, it's gonna sting like a raw sunrise when they black swan's gone.
Back at the resort, the curtains closed, you haven't left the room for two solid weeks.
With a pound of cocaine under the bed where the call girls perform their services.
And you have to leave CNN on so you don't think about her newborn son
Who entered this town from the crotch you're renting out.
""who's at the door? what the fuck!
Who's at the door? what the fuck!
Who's at the door? what the fuck!""
Your heart is sweating; your hands are turning black.
Your shadow breaks in wearing a ski mask.
Is that a machete at your throat?
""give me all your money! give me all the dope!""
And the sun's like a painting of your whole life.
You scratch at the canvas, but you can't get inside.

Twilight's million battered lips sleep in a house of fractured smiles.
Young love's clumsy fingertips are gonna find out for themselves.
The birds keep on singing from the tops of trees,
But the song's out of tune that drips from the breeze.
There's a razor in the garden waiting for a delicate head.
Look out!
Look out!
For diamonds sparkling where the trap doors swing into the bottom
Of a cold misery full of insults to add to your collection,
Parking lots dangling from your diction, daydreams bobbing in a shattered sea.
Look out!
Look out!
For sirens dancing where the nooses swing from gutted branches
Of your fantasies full of insults falling from your ceiling,
Motels where you're fucking without feeling, daydreams bobbing in a shattered sea.
Fake leaves shake like deceit on your tongue.
Desperate mothers devoured by young.
Hold on to love you learned to despise like an ocean choking on its own tide.
There's a razor in the garden waiting to cut through your seams.
Look out!
Look out!
The dull years drag the best days of your life through asphalt
And glass while summer's favorite fathers birthing next year's deadbeat dads.
Let's tack up another eviction note to matrimony's throbbing throat
Stuffed with songs from a synthetic past,
Silver clouds and artifacts full of insults to add to your collection,
Parking lots dangling from your diction, daydreams bobbing in a shattered sea.

We watched crabs and lobsters eat a dead cop's throat and stuff our mouths with gutted stereos.

Every single piano I've ever met in my life
Never sounded as good as melted Casio keys
Burning in a sea that sings out in 3-D.
Oh, that Laser Rain kept me up all night again
Scratching at the window like a bright colored beast
Howling at the dawn like an adulterous priest.
Shake your hands like they're full of feathers.
Shake your wings like they're laced with sound.
Shake your skin like a scrambled tv.
Gnash your teeth like a flamingo swarm.

and if your night unplugs its life.
Digital sunrise. Digital sunset.
Digital sunrise.

Oh, Team Machine!
The world's got no end and got no beginning.
Now I'm coughing up maracas and tambourines, looking over cliffs of eternity.
Shake your hands like they're full of disaster.
Shake your wings like they're painted with tar.
Shake your skin like it's sewn with insects.
Gnash your teeth like an exploding car.

and if your night unplugs its life
Blame it on the laser rain.

and if your life unplugs its eyes
Blame it on the laser rain.

because you can't blame the sun, it's been bought and sold to a day that's never dawning.
And you can't blame the sky, it collapsed twleve times;
Now it's buried in a digital coffin.
So you climb out to your windowsill
As the drum machines laugh to themselves.

Here comes the man with concussions in his pocket.
Here comes the man with a laser-guided rocket.
Here comes the man with a fistful of pills so you can kill with no remorse,
With no recourse, dance on your conscience until it's a corpse.
War never ends.
War never begins.
Hoist up the hag of destitution!
His mouth's an empty room where wild woes wander.
Young machetes in lingerie charm us all into a frenzy.
His mouth's an empty hole full of quadriplegics.
Here comes the man.
So you charge into battle, muscles rippling, tanks tingling.
Before you fire a shot a white flash feels up your flesh
And cloaks you in a robe of blood, maydays you in a ship of mud.
War never ends.
War never begins.
Hoist up the hag of destitution!
His mouth's an empty room where wild woes sleep sow.
Young machetes in lingerie charm us all into a frenzy.
His mouth's an empty hole full of quadriplegics.
They left you for dead in the desert haunted with the ghosts of prostitutes.
They want you!
They want you!
Dress my corpse up in a low-cut dress.
Drizzle lipstick on my charred french kiss.
Dip my severed jaw in cheap cologne, push-up bras dangling from snapped elbows.
But death's just death no matter how you dress it up.

John lennon and the rolling stones crooning in plastic bags.
Spit shine your black luck now, baby.
You turn on the radio, the speakers spit tangled talk.
Everything is war and who's fucked their way to the top.
But they'll eat black clouds we all eat black clouds.
You're working on a cruise serving caviar to the cruel.
They repossessed your heart; you're making payments on your face, too.

And what if your religion turns out to be a cruel joke, and you're fucked beyond all hope?
Gonna spit shine your black clouds now, baby.

Then you threw your phone away and slept beneath the freeway underpass.
Your mother slit her throat after your father's heart attack.
And you've got two little sisters still in school.

Just sit and watch the ships loading their freight
And pale pelicans feeding their young and grasp at the barbarically charming sun.
Out on the weekend talked your way out of a first date.
Said your uncle was famous, by then it was too late.
Spit shine your black luck now, baby.
Fall asleep to the tv-the cops are talking tough
To the cameras in the backseat, to the audience at home.
But they'll eat black clouds we all eat black clouds.
Once you knew a girl with skin like a sapphire sun.
Took you back to her apartment, told you everything you did wrong.
Spit shine your black luck.
Spit shine your black luck.

You sit in bed writing love letters to yourself.
No black ink on the black paper, bay.
Stare at the ceiling, fall into dreamless sleep.
Day climbs your chimney, taps you on the shoulder blade,
""spit shine your black clouds now, baby.""
All your best friends grow up to be successful actresses.
All your bitter enemies died of liver failure in kent, washington trailers.
All your brothers made babies until their brains turned brown.
The world's lounging longways on an unbridled black cloud.

Whose streets have you walked on?

Brittle moons breaking, giant swans pecking at all the free flesh.

Sprouting from the foreheads of world famous romancers.
The winter's looming like a bloodthirsty bird of prey.
And I guarantee by spring we'll either be world famous or goddamned dead.
Guitar one fastens languid years to busty bones like dust and skin on a dull antique moon.
Guitar two's touch keeps ruining lovers for other lovers
Like jokers concealed in trick decks in our laps.
There's a train tumbling down torn paper tracks while weeds blossom from heartbeats that lack.
Guitar three's dancing even though her song stopped playing ages and ages ago.
She's at an empty dance club suspended in the middle of a rambling sentence.
Guitar four says, ""if you still believe in the grace of man,
Let me introduce you to greedy greedy hands.""
Let's sling our rain slicks over every single second
To the rapture dripping from clocks ticking all our misadventures.
The winter left town with some seventeen-year-old waitress.
And spring's laying in a pile of all the moments of our misadventures.

Beautiful parks, wonderful art, I’ve been searching for you
What a wonderful start
It’s all a start, thinking the hips, black, long, colorful chicks
You should pride the thoughts in here, say goodbye, she always will
We go walking, have nothing to fear, fireworks in the air
Tell her wait, disappear, this a reason to celebrate, babe

Over my house into the clouds
To foreign lands in the sunshine

Over my house into the clouds

The Blue Aeroplanes,"On a railway train to anywhere,
Something happened finally.
The driver said he saw no station
And we were riding aimlessly.

The train was filled with sleeping passengers,
Going nowhere for the ride;
Spoken whispers filled the carriages
No one cared to look outside.

Conversation aimed at anyone
Bouncing questions off the wall;
Except for two excited children.
Burning caterpillars in the hall.

All at once, I got quite frightened..
Standing up, I gave a shout!
""I see a station just in front of me ,
Stop this train and let me out!""

The driver smiled and shook his head for me,
""this train don't stop for anyone.
And, if you want to leave this railway line,
You'll have to jump off on your own.

Someone came and gave me sandwiches,
Saying that I looked unwell.
He took my pulse and he gave it back to me,
And then he hit me with his bell.

He made a speech to all the passengers,
He said ""I've been a place today;
And anyone who'd care to come with me..
Step outside and walk this way.""

Inside the seats were warm and comfortable,
Outside the train was wild and strange.
I said, ""yes, sir, I'd like to come with you,
It's really time I made a change.""

I left my seat and walked up front with him,
And he began to push the door.
I looked outside, but it nearly blinded me..
I'd never seen such light before.

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

The Blue Dogs,"I was driving down the highway, on a dark and stormy night
A little girl by the roadside showed up in my head lights
I stopped and she got in the car and in a shaky tone
She said my name is Mary, please won't you take me home

She must have been so frightened, all alone there in the night
Something was so awfully wrong, her face was deathly white
She sat there in the back seat, the back seat all alone
I never will forget the night, I took Mary home

I pulled into the driveway, where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car, opened up the door
I just could not believe my eyes, the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car, but Mary wasn't there

A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl was looking for
Then the lady gently smiled, brushed the tears away
She said it sure was nice of you to go out of your way

But thirteen years ago today, in a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life, how we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shown
You're the 13th one that's been here bringing Mary home

She'll speak your name to everyone she can

She's telling dirty lies she's a devil in disguise in disguise

Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can do without
She's a devil in disguise you can see it in her eyes

Bacon, lettuce, and home grown tomatoes
Up in the morning, and out in the garden
Lord, get you a ripe one; don't get a hard 'un

All winter without 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' and the diggin'
Every time I go out and pick me a big'un

What'd life be without home grown tomatoes?
There's only two things that money can't buy:
That's true love and home grown tomatoes

You can go out and eat'em - that's for sure
But there's nothin' a home grown tomato won't cure
You can put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your own; your very own tomato juice
You can eat 'em with eggs, you can eat 'em with gravy
You can eat 'em with beans; pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side, put 'em on the middle
Home grown tomatoes on a hot cake griddle

[Chorus]

If I could change this life I lead
I could be Johnny Tomato Seed
I know what this country needs
It's home grown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die, don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Put me out in the garden would be much better
Hell, I could be pushin' up a home grown tomatoes

I ain't afraid to admit it

But I'm sure going to stand up and sing about it

I find myself thinking about the time you found me
I was lost until you came around
With your sweet love

In my dreams
Sometimes I think I feel you right behind me
And it seems it's just the little things that remind me

Just a fool
With wandering eyes
But I was blind
Until I realized
Your sweet love

Oh by and by
As my eye
Caught you walking by
Much to my surprise
Me with my disguise
You saw through it all
I never knew that something was wrong
Until your light came along

Sometime though the night builds walls around me
I try reaching out from a window inside me

Reach for you
Arms open wide
Promise me
Forever and besides
All I need
When I lay down at night
All I need
Is your sweet love

And every night, I hope that I won't dream of you
I still hear your voice calling out to me
And your pretty face that I will never again see, I see, I see

I know trouble like the falling rain
May not come tomorrow but will surely come again
And the words I'm sorry often come too late
For a fare I left you with nothing left to say
At trouble bay, trouble bay, here I'll stay, trouble bay

Like a wave coming after me
In the water cold
Dark and deep
I'll face these days on my own

When the sun goes down the shadows disappear
And the words I love you are all that I hear
I call your name in the darkest hour
Whisper your name, whisper in vain

So every night, I wait to pay the devil's due
I don't want to sleep, I don't want to dream of you
I don't want trouble, baby, I don't need trouble, baby
Your love is trouble, baby, here I stay

The Blue Notes,"Hey, lady, can I say something to you for a minute?
Please? No, Now before you take your coat off, That's it
I got something to tell you
See, what I have to say is so very important to our relationship
Why is it that every time we go out on the town, we get around our friends?
Man, you're always talking about what you got, huh
Went out and bought for you
How much money I make
And what school our children go to
And all the fancy clothes and big pretty cars
The big diamond rings, and them fantastic mink coats
Is you for real? No, I don't think you are
Sit down, No, no, sit down
Now don't say nothing, You see
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that is your problem
That is your problem, You're always saying the wrong tthing at the right time
You see I don't--I don't know how to explain this to you
The best I can tell you is what my mother told me as I was coming up
She used to say, ""Son, chances go 'round,""
She said, ""The same people that you meet going up
They make the same old faces coming down,""
Heh, tell the truth
You see, people today, they come out there to party
They come out to party, man
They didn't come out to hear all that jive mess you talking about
You standing up in the corner with a bottle of champagne taking about
Harry, Joe, and Dick and Bobby and what they ain't got
And they live down in the lower development homes, and you won't even help
You won't even buy 'em a drink
Is that any way to meet them?
If you're gonna boast, boast around somebody that has what you have
Don't make your own brothers and sisters feel bad
You see Listen
I know you know what I'm talking about because from time to time
I can remember you coming to me putting your head on my shoulder and crying
""Oh, papa, why? Why? Why don't nobody wanna be my friend?""
You told me a long time ago, You said, ""Papa, what am I doing?""
I didn't wanna tell you that
I thought you had sense enough to realize what you're doing, but I see you don't
Sit down and listen to me, No, sit down!
You see, people are too sensitive today
They don't wanna hear all that jive you talking back
You see, they don't wanna hear about what you got
cause they're trying to get it, too
Heh, tell the truth
I can't very much blame her
As much as it hurts me, it hurts to see people
going around behind our backs saying that
""This woman this, this woman that,"" or ""she ain't this"" or ""she ain't that""
I wanna be proud of you, mama
I wanna be proud of you
Listen, as long as you live
As long as you live whether you're with me or not

Be for real, girl
Just be for real, yeah, (Be for real)
Be for real, girl
Be, be, be for real, yeah, (Be for re-e-e-eal)
Be for real

You shouldn't have to worry about how you've been living good
No, if you're smartly dressed, Hey, baby, Hey, baby
What you should be doing is getting down on your knees every night
And thanking the man above for being blessed right now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you want your friends to think you're starting with a smile
Be for real, girl
Just be, be for real, (Be for real)
Be, be for real

I can't let you go on chasing my friends away
Because of the silly and stupid things you say
Yeah, baby, Yeah, baby, Hey, baby
You better dig yourself there, woman
Putting people down is less best to you
It just don't pay, Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want people today by starting with a smile

On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

On a hot stove was pots and pans
Say, that's hot, I began to shout

Drank the hot grease from the frying pan

To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

The Bluegrass Album Band,"Back in the days of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my home
Mother and dad called to heaven
I was left in this world all alone

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot that's in my memory
I'm on my way back to the old home
The light in the window I long to see

Lives a little girl named Pearly Blue
About so high and her hair is brown
The Prettiest thing boys in this town

Now anytime you want to know
Where I'm going, down the road
Get my girl on the line
You'll find me there most any old time

Now everyday and Sunday too
I go to see my Pearly Blue
Before you hear that rooster crow
You'll see me headed down the road

Now old man Flatt he owned the farm
From the hog lot to the barn
From the barn to the rail
He made his living by carrying the mail

I walk the soles right off my shoes
I don't know why I love her so
That gal of mine lives down the road

And all that I have left is just a memory
And it always haunts me with a breeze

The Blues Brothers,"All you fellows, gather round me
and let me give you some good advice.
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
you better think about it twice.
While you're out cheatin' on your woman
there is something you never even thought of
and that is:

Who's making love to your old lady
while you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
while you were out making love?

I've seen so, so many fellows
all in that same old bag
thinkin' that a woman is made to
to be beat on and treated so bad.
Oh, fellows, let me ask you somethin'
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of
and that is:

Who's making love to your old lady
while you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
while you were out making love?

I know that other women
give the other excuse.
I'm not tryin' to run your life,
boy, that's up to you, oh you,
oh oh, you you.

Reason why I ask this question,
I used to be the same old way.
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late.
Oh yeah, that's when it all happened,
something I never ever dreamed of.

Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
while I was out makin' love.
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady

The Blues Brothers,"All right people. the rest of the hard working all star blues brothers are gonna be out here in a minute, including my little brother jake. but right now, I'd like to talk a little bit about this
tune you're hearing. this is ofcourse the green onions tune. it was a very big hit in the early sixties in this country. and ofcourse it was composed and recorded in memphis, tennessee, right here
in the united states of america. you know, people, I believe that this tune can be equated with the great classical music around the world.

Now you go to germany, you've got your bach, your beethoven, your brahms... here in america you've got your fred mcdowell, your irving berlin, your glenn miller, and your booker t & the mg's
.Another example of the great contributions in music and culture that this country has made around the world. and as you look around the world today, you see this country spurned.

You see backs turned on this country. well people, I'm gonna tell you something, this continent, north america, is the stronghold! this is where we're gonna make our stand in this decade! yeah,
people I've got something to say to the state department. I say take that archaic monroe doctrine, and that marshall plan that says we're supposed to police force the world, and throw 'em out! let's stay
Home for the next ten years people! stay right here in north america and enjoy the music and culture that is ours. yeah, I got one more thing to say.

I'm just talking about the music, people, and what it does to me. and that is, as you look around the world, you go to the soviet union or great britain or france, you name it, any country... everybody is doing flips and twists just to get into a genuine pair of american blue jeans! and to hear this music and we got it all here in america, the land of the chrysler 440 cubic inch engine!

But it ain't exactly beating down my door

And you cant feel them working anymore
So pour them down the sink

And listen to me

Is baby kick off your shoes 
And lay down
Climb up here with me
And lets forget about sleep
And lay down

Why hide your face from me?
Why turn away?
All I wanna do is pull you closer and say

I'm feeling kinda tired
But it ain't exactly beating down my door
Now just why should this be

Will you listen to me

Lay down with me
Lay down next to me

You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

I said, that's life (that's life) and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (that's life) I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out

I just pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (that's life) that's life
And I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shakin' come here this July

I felt the whole building contract and expand,
I dreamt us together in the dark skies above,
On a road to the stars, in a Vostok of love.

I was made to realise that I could never exist,
She brushed me aside and tapped off her ash,

The Bluetones,"It was in those wonder-lust years, after I'd just left school,
That I first started to notice the change in everything.
I realised that the people I'd known all my life, (Take a long hard look,)
My family and friends were all just like strange little islands. (around the world you've helped to build.)
I didn't know who they were any more than I knew myself. (A Techni-colour wide-screen hell,)
It was at this point that I just started to drift. (beyond your window sill.)
A small balloon escaping from a child's hand. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

I withdrew from all social activity quite dramatically,
Never seeing anybody unless I absolutely had to.
For the first 8 and a half months, (God-forsaken,)
I saw no-one except the guy who worked in the all-night petrol station. (belly-aching,)
And that suited me just fine. (low-life parasite.)
I dreamt of never having to go outside for any reason again, ever. (So much angry cynicism,)
Of being buried in my house with all my stuff, (so much angst and spite.)
Like a huge asbestos sarcophagus. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

And I know what you're thinking,
'This guy needs to get out a bit more. Make contact.'
But that's not it. You see,
Since I've been away from other people,
Lots of things have improved in my life.
I'm a much better individual, thank you.

I'd follow the firemen
I'd dreamed of the astronauts
They looked so happy in their shiny metal headgear
I knew that inside they were smiling
Ba da da da da da
Ba da da da da da
Ba da da da da da
Ya dop ba dop ba dop ba dop bop
My mother feared I was abnormal
I'd take out the colandar
And put it on my head
People are happy when they know that they're protected
Just let me tell you why I'm smiling
I've got my helmet on
Nothing can do me wrong
I've got my helmet on
Ya dop ba dop ba dop ba dop bop
In shining rows they sit in every beauty parlour
Down in the coal mines lighting the way
From distant battlefields to the tiniest motor scooter
There is peace on every single face
My friends all tell me I'm retreating
But how can they argue
With true serenity
If they would only try just once to wear a helmet
The world would soon be a better place
Come try my helmet on
Nothing will do you wrong
Come try my helmet on

And then your dad came downstairs and said

Snored and his tennis shoes stunk

The Bobs,"The next thing I knew, there was a pain in my head like
My sinuses were cracking. The Santa Ana winds had come
Back, and the whole city of L.A. was acting like it had
PMS. I heard high heels on the linoleum floor of the outer
Office. She came in wearing a pair of clam diggers that
Had obviously never been to a beach, and a halter top that
Had been in a dryer for three weeks on high. My contact
Lenses popped out and went looking for water. She said
She'd give me three hundred clams if I helped her find
Her uncle...
""Sure, baby.""
So I went to her apartment at eight
To get a down payment of clams
I knocked on her door
There was no answer
I knocked again, hard this time
The door swung ajar..it wasn't a pretty sight
It looked like a moonscape
The plants were all brown and shriveled and the leaves
Were falling off her banana fern
The Pup and Taco I'd had for lunch
Was doing lesson three from Arthur Murray
I ran to the bathroom, but she was there...
Out cold
Indiscreet
In the flesh
In the tub
Surrounded by countless empty bottles and jars
Of skin care lotion
She was so slippery I couldn't pick her up
I had to slap her around to bring her to
Her eyelids fluttered, she looked at me
And I saw
In the eyes of my Santa Ana Woman
In the eyes of my Santa Ana Woman
In the eyes of my Santa Ana Woman
We spent the next three days
Raising the humidity in her apartment
And then she got a call from the Amazon
It was her uncle
She didn't even bother to pack the chapstick
The next thing I knew she was gone and the smog was back
And I can't help but wonder:
What made her think I was a detective?

Chicken fajitas with nachos and peppers

Rehearsing their moves while they waited for the salad
Her cowboy boots were red with black trim
And he was so handsome, so tall and so slim
Were they angels of mercy or dance instructors?

That they were there in Arizona to go dancing.
They two-stepped to my table
And hugged their arms around me
Pulled me to my feet and we whirled across the floor
