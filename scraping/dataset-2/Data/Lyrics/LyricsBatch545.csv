Kenny Wheeler,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1995
Kenny Wheeler,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?,2002
Kenny Wheeler,"When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

Letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are

Is all I need and more",Where Do We Go from Here?,2003
Kenny Wheeler,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,2005
Kenny Wheeler,"Come on, baby, while the moon is high
Kick up your heels and dance
Don't be nervous, don't be shy
And give yourself a chance
You can dance
Kick off your shoes and lose your blues
Pick em up, Lord, put em back down
And around, and around, and around, and around.

Come on, baby, it must be fun
To be dancin' in the clear moonlight
Otherwise, would everyone be out on
Such a cold and windy night?
We can dance.
Throw yourself away
Holy month of may
You can dance.

Listen to the music of the steel guitar
Don't it sound good
Hey now, nobody here tonight came to look at you,
No, no, no
Well I bet you five dollars that somebody starts a fire
Back in the woods, hey now
Everybody here tonight came to boogie
Have a good time, too

Come on, baby, while the moon is high
Kick up your heels and dance
Don't be nervous, don't be shy
And give yourself a chance
You can dance
Kick off your shoes and lose your blues
Pick em up, Lord, put em back down
And around, and around, and around, and around
If I could lose my mind
If I could throw myself away.

Kenny Young,"Oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire proof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
Mm-mm, you can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

Kenny Young,"Get aboard the silver bird, departing gate 19.
Satisfy your Walter Mitty mind, tryin' out a dream.
Your sign is Capricorn and every corner of your mind,
Says you'll remain my friend, my friend until your mine.

Silver bird, fly my lady away,
Silver bird, take her over the bay,
Silver bird, give my lady a ride,
And let her go see what's on the other side.
Silver bird, fly my lady away,
Pretty bird, today is the day.

Lone rangers and strangers will knock at her door,
But I know my baby's no baby no more.
Silver bird, fly my lady away.
Pretty bird, today is the day.

When you come home my crazy heart will greet those silver wings.
Your pet dog will remember you, and I'll carry your things.
We'll catch a runnin' make-up, and you will look just fine,
And you'll remain my friend, my friend until you're mine.

僕らはどこへ行こうか 階段の途中で

不確かな言葉を携えて 呼吸を揃えて初めまして
そんで愛されたのなら大歓迎 
繰り返し向かえ遠く向こうへ

結局僕らはさ 何者になるのかな
迷い犬みたいでいた 階段の途中で

大胆不敵に笑ったって 心臓はまだ震えていて
それでもまたあなたに会いたくて 
下手くそでも向かえ遠く向こうへ

大根役者でいいとして 
台本通り踊れなくて
ただまっすぐ段を登っていけ 
わかっちゃいたって待ちぼうけ
みっともないと笑ってくれ 
僕に名前をつけてくれ
踊り場の窓に背をむけて 
前を見て向かえ遠く向こうへ

不確かな言葉を携えて 
呼吸を揃えて初めまして
そんで愛されたのなら大歓迎

Kenshi Yonezu,"いつか僕らの上をスレスレに
通りすぎていったあの飛行機を
不思議なくらいに憶えてる
意味もないのに なぜか
 
不甲斐なくて泣いた日の夜に
ただ強くなりたいと願ってた
そのために必要な勇気を 探し求めていた
 
残酷な運命が定まっているとして
それがいつの日か僕の前に現れるとして
ただ一瞬 この一瞬 息ができるなら
どうでもいいと思えた その心を
 
もう一度 遠くへ行け 遠くへ行けと

いつだって目を腫らした君が二度と
悲しまないように笑える
そんなヒーローになるための歌

転がっていくストーリーを
 
「守りたい」だなんて言えるほど
君が弱くはないの分かってた
それ以上に僕は弱くてさ
君が大事だったんだ
 
「独りで生きていくんだ」なんてさ
口をついて叫んだあの日から
変わっていく僕を笑えばいい
独りが怖い僕を
 
蹴飛ばして 噛み付いて
息もできなくて
騒ぐ頭と 腹の奥が
ぐしゃぐしゃになったって
衒いも外連も消えてしまうくらいに
今は触っていたいんだ 君の心に
 
僕たちはきっといつか
遠く離れた太陽にすら手が届いて
夜明け前を手に入れて笑おう
そうやって青く燃える色に染まり
おぼろげな街の向こうへ
手をつないで走っていけるはずだ
君と未来を盗み描く
捻りのないストーリーを
 
カサブタだらけ荒くれた日々が
削り削られ 擦切れた今が
君の言葉で蘇る
鮮やかにも 現れてく

蛹のままで 眠る魂も
食べかけのまま 捨てたあの夢を
もう一度 取り戻せ
 
もう一度 遠くへ行け 遠くへ行けと

どうしようもないほど熱烈に
いつだって目を腫らした君が二度と

Kensington,"Sorry for the road that I won't take
For the words that I won't say
For the love that I won't give
Sorry for the heart that I won't show
For the lengths that I won't go
For the life that you won't live
Sorry that I opened up my arms
You would never reach in time
Before they closed again

You will forget
And I won't remember it
When all I ever did was race in circles
You will forget
And all there's left will be
A faded memory
A dream you woke up from

Sorry for the oath that I won't take
For the vows that I will break
For the role that I won't play
Sorry that I'm raising up my walls
And whenever you reached over
You are thrown back to the start

You will forget
And I won't remember it
When all I ever did was race in circles
You will forget
And all there's left will be
A faded memory
A dream you woke up

From the color I would bring to ending up again
Opening darkness I wanted to hold you back
From the colour I would bring to ending up again
Opening darkness I wanted to hold you back

Kensington,"Can’t sit around holding up my guard

Raging on too long and all will stay
Unsolved

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees

I ought to grow
But do I ever?

Kent,"Do har tänkt allt som sagts 
Om mig
Do kan tro allt do har hört
Om mig
Do kan ställa frågor om
Sanningen
Finns det en eller finns 
Det tusen
Svara rakt från hjärtat nu
Ditt medlidande kan jag vara utan
Om det här ska vara allt vi hann
Så håll mig hårt
Håll mig älskling nu

Stockholm vaknar långsamt
På droger och på sorg
Snön hyr ut sin oskuld
Till hela kungsholmstorg
Det känns som när jag kom hit
Way back in 93
En ynklig rad av fotspår
En okänd kontinent

Snälla snälla släpp taget nu
Jag kan stå gå eller krypa 
Härifrån
Om det hr är allt vi hinner med
Så håll mig hårt min
Älskling nu

Vaknar staden långsamt 
Och jag är full igen
Snön hyr ut sin oskuld
För skiten bara känns
Och det känns som när jag kom hit
Way back in 93

Och det sista brevet skickades till en ogiltig adress
Med ett frimärke värt en halv långvårdsenhet

Men även hundratusen röster kan ha fel",18:29-4,2011

Kent,"Han fångade sparken med huvudet
Han hade tänkt alla tankar ändå
Han stod inte upp när han fick den
För full för att ens kunna gå
Långsamt glömmer man bort allt
Också pojkar I manchestertyg
Men jag minns våra skrikiga stolar I köket
Och virveln på min kula av porslin
Min vän hade kritvita tänder
Hans kläder luktade rök
Så levande att det ibland känns
Som om det är jag som är död
Refr.
En blank dank
Låg så tungt I min hand
En dank Frank
Jag kommer aldrig närmare än så
En blank förmiddag I handen på Frank
Han fångade sparken med huvudet
Som att nicka en fotboll I mål
Som att kasta en sten högt över taken
Och klättra dit ingen kan nå
Långsamt glömmer man bort allt
Också träskor och gul blend I smyg
Men inte saker han sa som gjorde mig större
Inte så blyg
På hans jacka satt fyra märken
Hjältar I glittrande tyg
Slade Kiss Bowie & Sweet, året när pinups var ny

Nu är jag större, större än du....

Somliga vet att dom är starkare
Än andra
Somliga älskar att slå sönder

Somliga lever för att pina varandra

Blek & Gul
Framför TV:n
Blir vemsomhelst ful
Jag hatar dig
Do är....
Jag håller handen för
Men där finns ett hål
Så jag ser ändå
Om do visste hur löjlig

I caught your hands under our table

Closer to the sun before the summer slides to October

Are dragged in the flow

An emperor without his clothes
And still my hands are shaking
Broken with an overdose

On chemicals I'm burning
Drunk deadly and old
And still there's something here
That leaves my cold

Still we're waiting

Take a deep breath, relax
Out upon the stairway
It's frozen and it shines like glass

We've been sleeping through September
And we're brittle as the frozen glass
And still I think I know
I'm coming back

I saw a picture from my eighties 
My hardrock self, and I wonder who it was 
I saw a film, a vision of the future 
A commentary.. 
The ending was so sad in the director's version 

And then comes that feeling, that sneaking feeling 
The only one I can't do anything about 
Then I close the soul, squeezing it to death 
And find a heavenly drug 
And then comes that feeling 
Am I the only one who never understands? 

I saw a picture from my nineties 
23rd birthday, and I wonder who I was 

I saw a film, a man with a pistol
A commentary..
The ending was so beautiful in an uncut version 

And then comes that feeling, that sneaking feeling 
The only one I can't do anything about 
Then I close the soul, squeezing it to death 
And find a heavenly drug

Där alla dörrar var så tunga att dom inte krävde lås

Dom ledde mig förbi rader av stärkta sängar
Där våra steg ska eka länge efter att vi alla gått ur tiden
Dom skriker ditt namn just när regnet träffar fönstren
Och en ond vind skakar träden, tamburin shakers av döda löv

Och dom tog mig till en smutsig strand
Där vålnader av surfare som drunknat samlade PET-flaskor för pant
På en grusväg mellan fält där ondskans blommor tilläts växa
Och förvandla evig skog till skvallerpress

Och dom pekar mot en fond, giftgula moln
Oranga lampor, tysta silos, jetplans ångspår, bengrå torn
Dom viskar i mitt öra
""Ser du framtiden, ser du hur inget växer, inget lever men ingen dör?""

När man äntligen kan se alla mekanismerna där bakom
Så blir man aldrig rädd mer
När man äntligen kan se alla kejsare står nakna
Så vänder allt igen
Allt vänder om igen

Jag vaknar i en sal, på ett skuggigt sjukhus står en kvinna
vid min säng som blekt sina tänder en grad för hårt
Hon smeker min kind varligt med en hand konstgjord som dockors
Rynkfri, ringlös, målad, tung och febervarm

Och vi lurar ditt porslin, små ilskna utslag är en släng av
allergi främst mot min samtid och min tro
Jag skriver ditt namn tveksamt på ett vykort, liksom testar
Vem du var, det har jag glömt för längesen

När man äntligen kan se vem som drar i alla trådar
Så blir man aldrig rädd mer
När man äntligen kan se alla kejsare stå nakna
Så vänder allt igen
Allt vänder om igen

Il vivait aux États-Unis 
Sa vie fut une affaire de choix 
Il était habillé de noir 
Un visage taillé à la hache 
Chantait voûté sur sa guitare 
Il s'appelait Johnny Cash 

L'homme en noir avait un frère 
Qui est mort pour un dollar 
D'un coup de scie circulaire 
En plein cœur de l'espoir 
Il a fui les champs de misère 
Pour une existence à l'arrache 
La vie, faut pas la laisser faire 
Si tu veux qu'elle te paie cash 

Bientôt l'Amérique entendit

Qui racontaient les insoumis 
Les rebelles et les nuits d'alcool 
Avec le King et Jerry Lee 
Il a parcouru sans relâche 
Les routes des États-Unis 
Jusqu'à ce que son cœur lâche 

Trop d'alcool et trop de speed 
Le succès peut être un enfer 
L'amour aussi faisait le vide

Et son cœur se remit en marche

Repousse les flèches du cadran qui lacèrent son indolence 
Et le jetteront tôt ou tard sur le trottoir
Hors de sa bulle neigeuse, sur le tapis roulant d'un futur hagard
Dehors des jambes cisaillent le temps qu'aucune immobilité ne corrompt
La vie est une musique qu'improvise l'humanité rendue à ses tâches 
Quiconque ralentit le pas ou bien s'arrête 
Sort du tempo et se désaccorde en dissonance nuisible
L'homme du havre se rêve pierre, arbre, totem 
Réfractaire à la chair insolente
Son avenir n'existe pas, il est au présent incessant 
Son passé est à mille verres de là
Son sourire se veut murmure, son murmure se veut sermon 
Ses sermons sont des soliloques, des paroles en loques
L'homme du havre est un disque rayé qui creuse le sillon qu'il ne quittera plus jusqu'à s'y enterrer 
Une tape dans le dos relance sa chanson, couplet, refrain, couplet, pont, shunt

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park

One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite

'Til the river runs dry
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
It has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance that tide
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll tke soome falls
With the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Lord, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Kent Blazy,"This ain't comin' from no prophet,
Just an ordinary man.
When I close my eyes,
I see the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand.
When the last child cries for a crust of bread,
When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.
Stand straight, walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.
When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out,
'Cause we shall be free.
And when money talks for the very last time,
And nobody walks a step behind;
When there's only one race,
And that's mankind, then we shall be free.
We shall be free ,we shall be free
Stand straight, (walk proud,)
Have a little faith, (hold out;)
We shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free,
(Stand straight,) stand straight,
(Have a little faith,) walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.",We Shall Be Free,2000

Kent Cressman,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Pat 'em down, count the money, let 'em see the work (Yeah)
That's the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first (Nah)
Won't be the last, all we see is cash (Yeah)
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (Liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had that hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (Never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac (Jada)
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back
Either way I ain't never evil
Why you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em
My heart stops, but the words are forever breathing
You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason

First thing first don't ever play yourself (Ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (Never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (It's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (Swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him (You can't)
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (Hey bighead)
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key

Mami yellin' I'm the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo
'Bout to let the cans go, woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin' Uber 'cause I'm franchised in Cuba
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline
Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five
Gotta stay away from day driftin', all sauce
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk

Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins
Prepare for the killin', now please line up all of the coffins (Closed casket nigga)
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?
Pop you in your shit, brotha, now make room for the money (Move!)
If you don't make room, I'll beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful (Thank you so much)
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga
Don't play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket
Hate yourself 'cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
Talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Don't you ever play yourself

I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks that nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders to keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom, oh please, or don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
'Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the Sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her, ""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, uh, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain, 'cause bitch there's no arteries

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust,2000

In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Ought to tie 'em all up with a rope

Now, you boys better get in tune
Sis' Draper's gonna be here soon
Don't shoot no dice nor get too tight

She'll play all night if she feels like it
Drink some fruit punch if you spike it
Sis' don't care who don't like it
See, ol' Sis has got a heck of a bow arm on her

She stepped right up and sawed one off
And uncle Cleve dropped his jaw
Said she's the best I ever saw
She must be from Arkansas

Now, I think grandpa used to date her
Grandma said she still hates her
All the fellas stand up straighter
In the presence of Sis' Draper

Sis' Draper is her daddy's daughter
Plays the fiddle that he bought her
Plays it like her mamy taught her
She's a travelin' Arkansawyer

She put her fiddle in the box
And said it's getting awful late
She's on her way to Little Rock
And Little Rock can't wait

So, we all stood there in the yard
Hands full of watermelon
Watched her leave and watched her go
Wishin' we was in that wagon

Plays the fiddle that he bought her
Plays it like her mamy taught her
She's a travelin' Arkansawyer

Play it Sis'

Il a volé mon cœur et a rendu ma vie amère
Il faut que je m'éloigne, que j'oublie ma tristesse
Tout me ramène à lui, j'ai l'impression de me perdre.

Je ne veux vivre dans le passé
Je ne suis plus vraiment là, car pour moi, le temps s'est arrêté
Son odeur enivre toutes mes journées
Je me noie dans son regard et je m'égare dans l'océan des regrets.

Il faut que je répare tout ce que tu as détruit
Tu entres dans ma vie et tu repars sans rien dire
Ton odeur flotte encore dans mes souvenirs
Prends tes mots, tes promesses et laisse-moi me reconstruire.

Décrivent et dénoncent tous ce qui est non conforme
Ils grandissent et deviennent en y mettant les formes,

Je ne suis encore qu'une enfant

Je sors mes plus belles notes
Pour vous dire que je vous aime

Nous on va au-delà des apparences

Nous on s'unit et on avance

Nous on va au-delà des apparences

Entre le Maghreb et la France
Pour les frères et les soeurs on vient représenter

J'suis un poète, Vitry sur l'oued
Le pétrole jaillit des blocs
Avec rien on fait des prouesses
J'prends d'la valeur comme le Dinard
Impérial 9.4 Val De Marne
La ville hard comme à Wall Street
Un bad trip j'suis dans la zone où la terre tremble
J'ai des messages qui rassemblent
Jamais je regrette j'fais ce que mon coeur me dit
Ici c'est la chaleur des valeurs du Maghreb
Best story d'où j'viens c'est trop loin
C'est un trou, J'pars en express pour le mariage d'un zin-cou
On saute jusqu'au ciel et on retombe sur nos terres
Nos anciens on en profitent, on a peur de les perdre
Rheiy, tous bien habillés fais péter la planche à billets
J'profite s't'année pour les frères qui sont tombés
Envoies des thunes pour la corniche ou brûler Saint-Tropez

Allô Vitry, allô le quartier
J'ai le moral en taille, j'ai trop racaille
L'unité c'est tout ce qui nous reste
Le partage et l'entraide, Maghreb United
Viens me faire la bise, 3amek
Arrêtez de jurer sur les mères,
Arrêtez de jurer sur La Mecque

Malgré nos différences les soucis et les coups de gueule
On a cru en nous, en notre coup de foudre
Saïd c’est toi et moi le reste on s'en fout
Avec la patience aujourd'hui nous voilà unis
Devant Dieu et nos familles on s'est dit oui pour la vie
Fusionnels dès le début
J'ai jamais aimé si vite
En l’amour je ne croyais plus
Mais quelques mois plus tard le rêve devient un cauchemar
J'apprends que mon cœur de jour en jour s’affaiblit
Trop belle était l’histoire je n'ai plus d’échappatoire
Il me faut un donneur au plus vite

Prends ma main

J’ai juré devant Dieu
De faire la guerre à tes côtés
Oui de ne jamais déserter
Face à tes problèmes de santé
Bébé sans toi je suis rien du tout
La vérité
Tu es cette chaise sous mes pieds quand une corde me tient le cou
Kenza, t'as toujours été le pansement de toutes mes plaies
Quand dans ma tête c’était le feu
Tu venais jouer le pompier
Aujourd’hui je ne suis pas prêt
D’entendre les médecins
Pour toi je me battrais
Jusqu’à ce que Joe Black me tende la main

Je sais mais le temps passe, je me demande ce que tu fais
Tu n'es plus présent je me sens comme abandonnée
Sûrement avec tes potes à trainer dans les halls
Pendant que je porte cette maladie seule sur mes épaules
J'attends toujours que sonne ce foutu bipper
Je vois la fin tu es absent
Et j’ai si peur
L’espoir fait vivre
Mais d’après les docteurs, il en reste si peu
Je dois me préparer au pire

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Allô c’est moi, mon bipper viens de sonner, j’ai un donneur

À ton réveil je voudrais que tu saches l’honneur que j'ai eu d’être à tes côtés
La chance de m'être levé à côté d’une telle beauté
J’ai passé les cinq plus belles années de ma vie
Mais l’ai-je mérité
Loin de vivre au paradis
Quand j’y réfléchi avec du recul
Nos engueulades, nos prises de bec, ridicules
Aujourd’hui j’en rigole avec une larme au coin de l’œil bébé
Repense à tout ça pour pouvoir faire ton deuil bébé
Pardonne-moi de ne pas avoir été à tes côtés
Mais quand j’ai su que j'étais compatible
Je n’ai pas hésité, 1 seconde à être le donneur
Désormais c'est pour la vie que je suis ton coup de cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Prends ma main

Le gars qu'on croise et qu'on n' regarde pas
Y a pas de soleil sous la terre

Et dans ce bouquin y a écrit
Que des gars se la coulent douce à Miami
Pendant ce temps que je fais le zouave
Au fond de la cave

Moi je fais des trous dans des billets

Je fais des trous, des petits trous, encore des petits trous

Je vis au cœur de la planète
J'ai dans la tête
Un carnaval de confettis
J'en amène jusque dans mon lit
Et sous mon ciel de faïence
Je ne vois briller que les correspondances
Parfois je rêve je divague
Je vois des vagues
Et dans la brume au bout du quai
Je vois un bateau qui vient me chercher

Pour me sortir de ce trou où je fais des trous
Des petits trous, des petits trous, toujours des petits trous
Mais le bateau se taille
Et je vois que je déraille
Et je reste dans mon trou à faire des petits trous

Où je pourrais m'évader dans la nature
Je partirai sur la grande route
Et coûte que coûte
Et si pour moi il n'est plus temps
Je partirai les pieds devant

De quoi prendre un flingue
Se faire un trou, un petit trou, un dernier petit trou

Keoki,"The French are glad to die for love.
They delight in fighting duels.
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels.
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental,
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat.

As girls grow old,
And we all lose our charms in the end.

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice,
But get that ice or else no dice.

He's your guy 
When stocks are high,
But beware when they start to descend.

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic,
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes.

Time rolls on,
And youth is gone,
And you can't straighten up when you bend.

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees,
You stand straight at Tiffany's.

Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days

Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco

Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say ""sweat""
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park

'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew

When we were kids

I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man

He was all I wanted, late night talkin', 
On the phone till daylight often, 
At home he came through, dinner on the table, 
Plate bites lost him, the love was strong then, 
We went for walks then, then I lost him, 
I mean he's still her but I ignore him, 
'cause he's too busy for me, 
He comes around a few minutes then leave, 
Things ain't the way they used to be, 
Then I met this guy right down the street, 
And this is what he said to me

Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
Every time I see you baby, lookin' so 
Good,let me show you girl, I can be so good

I tried to work things out, bring things back 
Arguments started, you don't know how to act, 
Could a brought up the fact, that today I met this new dude, 
And I don't need the say it, he probably would a thought I was playin', 
And he probably would a said stop playin', 

But this bullshit I'm about to stop, takin', 
'Cause this new guy's about to drop, waitin', 
I ain't playin, he played him self, 
Need space need time, oh well, you can have all the space in the world, and 
Your man might have found a new girl

Even though you don't know me, what can I do, 
Let me see you girl, one Saturday afternoon, 
Let me show you girl, I can be so good

Every girl need's affection, not somebody who's stressin', 
Hope he learned his lesson, 'cause in one direction, 
You can't see to the left and, you're stuck wit a dumb fuck, 
Who don't understand that one truck, don't matter to you, 

No car crib either, just you and him in a two seat a, 
But they always find out when its too late, 
Tellin' me to wait, no you wait, 
Wait till you see me in his arms, 
And understand that I'm gone

I see you girl, walkin' that avenue, 
Let me show you girl, I can be so good",So Good,2002

And I know it's not my time to go now

Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those
Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', got no,
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll  take her
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop

Holding our baby in her baby in her arms

Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy

To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them

Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies

Stepping through broken bottles and gum
Carrying her shoes, barefoot

Scared everybody away in the end

And when the fire happened, you know
Everybody assumed it was her

Decadent and drunken with desire
Fooling the love of everyone
Your reverence in flames

You were on fire

And no one's ever saved you
You only saw him bleed
And his sorrow misbehaved you
To avenge and not to plead
But out here there is no other

Barren, blameless for your lover
Bold and fearless for the crowd

Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama

Couldn?t get along with Pops cause they stayed in a fight
If it ain?t skipping school going out with grown men
Better your man named Sam with a white Benz
He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world

You my only girl
One night it was late, they kissing and hugging
Next thing you know they kissing and loving
Two days go by and Sam ain?t showed up
Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up

When Courtney was going with this hard working cat
A drug dealer came along and ?
Next thing you know she was taking it right
We part of the reason why she at where she at
Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack
His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke
Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope

Come on in,

I bumped in to this chick
Light skin and 5'6
Thick as a brick
Nice stomach with some wide hips
Approached her like what's good baby?
You seem hood baby
Maybe we could hook up oh yea we should baby
She asked my name
I laugh and flashed my chain
I can't stop staring
Damn she got ass and things
We can forget about the club and go to my crib
The finer things in life, that's how I live
I told her think about it, take a second, then tell me
She said ain't nothing to think about (ha ha)
Ya smell me
She got close and sniffed the fur-enheit
And almost overdosed
I stays fly ya know ya know

[Chorus]

We on the way to my house
Know what I'm thinking about
Pop some Jodecy in
That'll get her wet, no doubt
Look like you been needing a friend
To please, ya heard me
With that gangsta love, girl come ride with a G
Rolled up some of that sticky
Since she like to smoke
Did a 100 to the pad, had to stash the toast
Pulled into the driveway
Hopped out and opened the door
Y'all might think that's weak
But all the real players know
Got inside, said she's cold
So I turned the heat on
Persian rug on the floor
To wipe ya feet on
And in 15 minutes, head boss gonna get beat on
She ain't got no man,
Ain't got no woman,
Who there to cheat on?
Can I get it?

(This is how it went down)

We in my bedroom
She ask, can I take a shower
Hell yea, there go the soap, lotion and baby powder
She got undressed in front of me
She must been reading my mind
Glad I ain't buying
This something you'd want to see
Instantly, I snuck in
Then she told me, get in
I grabbed to glasses and a bottle of that Seagrams Gin
So we got in the Jacuzzi
Cause its more relaxing
Call me Mr. Miyagi
Cause that ass I'm gonna be waxing
She got a little tipsy
Then started feeling on me
Then start feeling on herself
Yep, its going down homey
Next thing I know,
She went down, I got blessed
Then she got on top and let it drop

And I don't even know if its something I even want no more

Yeah, yeah
Oh oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm used to moving out, feeling kinda stuck these days..
Because of you
And I'd be on the highway, if only I could leave my place
Because of you
I used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say
Because of you
An I been trying to hide but it's written all over my face
So I

I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong
And you turned out you wasn't it
If everything I thought so
But what do you do after love?
After love
What can you say when it's said and done
Nothing at all
Cause you can't hide a heart break
Wen you can't stop these tears from falling down
So what do you do? what do you do? what you do?

After love.
After love.
After love.
After love.
After love it hurts so bad
After love.
After love.

Yeah uh uh I remember that first day that I saw her face
The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape, she made my earth shake
I'm a try an keep the faith, do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care what him or her say
Thought I had a home run
But I'm just at first base I found out the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take
You was like air to me
You know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath
See life is but a dream, so is love and I believe
If you ever been in love you would know what I mean yeah
So lord help me please I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right
But trying to ignore cause I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound
Because of you
And tell me who woulda thought that id ever be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you
And I can get over it, but I ain't sure if I want to
Cause you dun made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
You gotta lie in it babe
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing
Don't mean a thing to me now
I can't believe I gave you one, last, shot
I let it ride now baby it's your stop
Oh so so leave
Now the jokes on me
It took a while to finally come to my senses
But what
What do you do, what do you do after love? oh
What can you say ..what can you say when it's said and done
When its over, oh
Cause you can't hide a heart break
Wen you can't stop these tears from falling down (i can't stop these tears)
So what do you do? what do you do?

After love.
After love.
After love.

(i know you hear me..listen to me (please)
This is what you made me do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise hurting you was never my intention
Something bout your style, the way that you presented her
Every fantasy I ever had you was in it
I apologize for every time that you might have cried
There's not enough words to describe how I feel inside
Guardian angel sent from the skies
I always knew you woulda made a beautiful bride
And that's why
I wish you could of stayed, so much
But I fucked up, an went and betrayed your trust (you know)
There's no more Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, trips to Nevada
And I admit what you probably heard was true
But outta of all these girls the only one I loved was you
I love you

You know I love you more then anything tho
That's one thing you can't run from
I just wanna end the conversation in a good way man

My favorite girl outside of my Impala
I ain't gon' say you a dream I don't gotta
You could walk around in the street with no problems

I pick up all the G that he speaks so don't bother
The innocent role ain't workin' work harder
I ain't tryin' to lock you down I'm no father
But maybe we can go for it if you just listen

It's hard as hell for a man in my position
They pickin' your girl out you gotta know the difference
I wonder if it's even in one in existence
Enough to keep my attention to go the distance

And I'm have to look hard to find a better one
'Cause you sex is a 187 'hon
You get a nigga doin' shit I ain't never done
So now even when I'm on tour I let her come

My past make me so weak
But you make me stronger

Now I'm right back where I belong

Help, I think Cupid got me
Shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin' my cool
So I'm doin' things I don't do

You're not the ones like I'm used to
I see us happy in our future
I'm givin' you all I have
My heart, my soul, my laugh

'Cause you are the only thing I need
I could have everything and more
Give you the feelin' you can't ignore

We missed it

Right when the fight
Has stopped it

We will never know

Sticks and humidors, that's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit

By every September 14th, that's my dream

I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me

This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blocking y'all from going to stores and buying it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was riding with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said ""Nas, why is he trying it?""
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning
Forgetting Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So ""Untitled"" it is
I never change nothing, but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas being told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it

Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebok'n

So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could

The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick

They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em

Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now

Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick

They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em

Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down, yeah",Knock You Down [Moto Blanco Club Remix],2009
Keri Hilson,"Same shit different day just riding through the city looking prettiest as usual
It's the same old thing got the name on the chain just to let them know who's who
And they know I've over here so they come and find me right after they lose you
For you niggas in the way we can let the guns say ""excuse you""
At the end of the day we just trying find our way and I might be a come up
And baby you hitch a ride but u gotta know how to do more than how to keep a thump up
It's so incredible that it ain't edible but they know the cake's real
Yo I couldn't even say ask these other silicon niggas how being fake feel

[Chorus]
Everyday is my day I'ma do it my way everyday
Everything about me, what they love about me everything
Everywhere that I be, feel VIP baby
And everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me

Somebody better tell em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby
See we be everywhere, and they ain't never there, couldn't tell you where they be
And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up
And I'm so bout my money you ain't talking about no money you ain't even gotta bring it up
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger up
I just stay sucker-free, leave the lames where they be, and I let my chips pringle up
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much you want
Don't know what you're looking for, unless it's a problem, I promise this ain't what you want

[Chorus]

Can you do me this favor, answer this question, y'all gon try who
See the shoes by Gucci, bag by Louie, the hating'll be by you
And I appreciate the love, thank the man above cause a nigga feel so blessed
And I ain't gonna stop, better get them red bulls, I don't give these haters no rest

Cause I put to much energy in him and me
Can't wait til I get through this phase
Cause it's killing me
To bad we can't re-write our own history

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

From sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry

When it come to makin' love
But you and me baby, this is real
And that's why it's number one

Sex that we're having here girl, oh
This is, this is number one
Sex that we're having here, girl, oh
(You better ask somebody)

Can't nobody do it like us
Can't nobody mix, chop, and screw it like us
All over the living room, hittin' it like us
In the middle of the night wake up the building like us

And it's okay if you wanna brag, the sex so good
Go and pat yourself on the back, and 'em haters
They gon' hate, but we just gon' keep blowing up
'Cause girl, they gon' hate anyway

You are now rocking with the best
I'll make you forget about the rest
Having sex with you is like making hits
Girl, we got egos, they can't tell us
That we ain't the shit and no

I'm in your mix like a number one record
And the beat goes on and on
And it don't stop you keep going, from the night on through the day
And I love it when you take me down and make me say

Sex that we're having here, girl, oh
This is, this is number one

When you're breaking me down just like a chop shop, hey
Cutting like some blades on a caddy
That's how you're working me, daddy
Every time you put that on my womb

You are now rocking with the best
I'll make you forget about your ex
This one here's a race where you don't wanna come first
I know what I'm doing, ain't no need to rehearse, yeah
A lot of dudes just be going nowhere fast

But you be steady cruising like you want it to last

That's how you made me a chocoholic
And right now my body's callin'
I gotta know how, you got the know how
Baby, you the champ of all that goes down

If your dick was a gun, it was stone cold

Them other girls was cool, but it's somethin' they was missin'
And I don't call them back ever since we hit it in the kitchen

That night at my home, trench coat, nothin' on
Your sex got me gone, went straight to my dome
And I love it, girl, I love it, ooh, I love it, girl, I love it

Girl, there's somethin' about you that thrills me
That's why after we lay, you get to know the real me, yeah

No matter what may occur in life
Everyday with her is like a plus

And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
Just wanna let you know we appreciate
Everything you do for us on a day to day
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
We do all that's in our power just to please you

Everything you said you'd give me, you couldn't give me
Yeah oh
'Cause the only one who ever made me cry, is you
And the only one I had to fight, is you
And it was you who told me

He said, that I would never have to fight again
He said, that I would never have to cry again
He said he'd had been to the battle field, 
My heart is safe with him
All my trust I gave it to him
So I guess I fell in love,
I fell in love with a toy soldier

I let down my guard because you were my guard
But who protects me know
'Cause I gave you my heart and you tore it apart
Ooh you let me down
Ooh baby

He said, that I would never have to fight again
He said, that I would never have to cry again
He said he'd had been to the battle field, 
My heart is safe with him
All my trust I gave it to him
So I guess I fell in love, with a toy soldier

I gave all my love to him hoorah hoorah
I gave all my love to him hoorah hoorah",Toy Soldier,2010

You used to find the heart to tell me you love me

Good things don't last forever, baby
Something 'bout you, girl, that drives me crazy
Ain't no ifs and buts or maybes
You'll always be my friend
You will always be
You will always be
Say you'll always be
My friend

She want to know what the reason I'm saying she can be my friend
But, baby, I'm a player, ain't no reason to pretend
By

[Chorus]

You're the only girl I wanna see daily
Not a lot save me but you could be my lady
Let's take it to another level you remember
The first day I got what you want and
It wasn't even your birthday, nah, now
We kick it too hard, you went too deep
Say you feel it in your heart, so
I'm a be real 'cause you give me what I want
And I ain't gonna tell you I love you if I don't
I understand you got a man
But he can't even understand how you feel
But if you stop coming around
And I don't see you again I guess we can
Just be, woo

[Chorus]

Now, ladies, you all know what I'm talking about
See, I don't want a man that will be dipping
In and out of my life, I want friend that be
There thick and thin, you know what I'm saying?
Someone to take it back to the eye's level
I want somebody to always run back to me
And trust I'll always be here with that cool thang

If I couldn't walk again, would you
Still be there for me if I lost it all today?
Would ya care for me? Yeah, would you write me?
In the bed kinda of friend that will be there
Without the Benz
You never ask about the money that you
Lent me, nah, you look good with your
Body; you're the type of girl that money
Can't buy me

It was a girl named Shanda
Drove a Honda
Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama
The real grown type
She was always right
Couldn?t get along with Pops cause they stayed in a fight
If it ain?t skipping school going out with grown men
Better your man named Sam with a white Benz
He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world
And even told Shanda 
You my only girl
One night it was late, they kissing and hugging
Next thing you know they kissing and loving
Two days go by and Sam ain?t showed up
Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up
Mamma found out and had Sam arrested
Now Shanda at the doctor?s cause she wanna get tested
When the results came back it was positive
That?s the thing about life; you learn and you live
Get up stand up for your life

Get up stand up for your life
Get up stand up for your life

It was a girl named Courtney
She was fine as hell
She was looking for a man with a lotta mail
She had big dreams about the real good life
And everything she wanted had a real high price
Like Dolce Gabbana, Gucci and Prada
So if you ain?t spend big Courtney ain?t holler
She all about the dollar, but let?s go way back
When Courtney was going with this hard working cat
A drug dealer came along and ?
Next thing you know she was taking it right
We part of the reason why she at where she at
Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack
His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke
Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope
She stuck with two kids and no child support
I did it for girls taking life for a joke
Get up stand up for your life
I said young girl
Get up stand up for your life
Get up stand up for your life
Even darkness comes to light 
I said young girl
Even darkness comes to light young girl

It was time to go
To the station, get myself ticket

I used to go

All I've got's this feeling

There's a cold chill running up and down my spine
Hesitation lingers in the back of my mind
Looking for the answer without any clues
Gotta find me a cure for the full moon blues

There's a hound dog just a howlin'
Wish I knew what he was trying to say
Maybe he hears a prowler
Maybe he's just wishin for the light of the day

She'd make her friends think that she didn't care

The little children playing
And bigger children
Spread the word

My memory is bad
So I always tend
To forget how it goes
But

Life is my creation
Is my best friend
Imagination
Is my defense
And I'll keep walking
When skies are grey
Whatever happens
Was meant that way

You're no better
Or no worse
Than the others
We are all the same

And life
Is just a moment
You might as well
Enjoy this day

It's time
To start believing
That everything
You want is on it's way
And

Life is my creation
Is my best friend

Is my defense

There's a creepy little house in a creepy little place
Little creepy town in a little creepy world
Little creepy girl with her little creepy face
Saying funny things you have never heard

Do you know what it's all about
Are you brave enough to figure out
Know that you could set your world on fire
If you are strong enough to leave your doubts

Feel it, breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
And you'll be walking on air

She has a creepy little cat and a creepy little bat
Little rocking chair and an old blue hat
That little creepy girl, oh she loves to sing
She has a little gift, an amazing thing

With her funny little eyes of hazel
With her funny old blue hat
She will go and set the world on fire
No one ever thought she could do that

Feel it, breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
And you'll be walking on air

Feel this, unless you kill it
Go on, and you're forgiven
I knew that, I could feel that
I feel like, I am walking on air

Flitter up, and
Hover down, be
All around, be
All around

You know that I love you
Go on

I used to walk across the streets with my eyes closed
To see if God existed and I never got hit
I danced along the edges of the rooftop
To see if I would fall
And I never did
And for a moment
I feel immortal

And I am not scared, I am not scared
I feel immortal
‘Cause I know you were there
‘Cause I know you are there
No one around me
Believed in anything so how could I
Expect them to believe in just a girl
I’d cry myself to sleep inside my bedroom

And swear I’d never let them crush my world
And for a moment
I feel immortal
And I am not scared, I am not scared
I feel immortal
‘Cause I know you were there
‘Cause I know you are there
I felt like a flower

Trying to grow from the pavement
They would walk all over me
I felt like a snowflake
In the middle of the desert
Wishing I’d melt so I could be free

Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,

Kermit the Frog,"Performed by Jimmy Buffett, The Great Gonzo, and Rizzo The Rat
From Kermit UnPigged - Jim Henson Records BMG Kidz.
(Talking)

Rizzo: Hey Look Gonzo, Jimmy's Buffet!

Gonzo: Oh, No No No No/ That's Jimmy Buffett. He's Recording in there.
Come on let's go say hello.

Rizzo: No thanks, I saw a sign down the hall that said meatloaf.

Gonzo: Well I'm going to see Jimmy...

Gonzo: Hello Jimmy

Jimmy: Gonzo

Gonzo: Hey, you don't look so good

Jimmy: I had the most amazing night last night
(Singing)

Jimmy: Woke up this morning, with light in my eye,
And then realized it was still dark outside.
It was a light coming down from the sky.
I don't know who or why

Gonzo: Must be those strangers that come every night,
Whose saucer shaped light, put people uptight.
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark.
I hope they get home alright.
(Chorus)
Both: Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along.
I won't do anything wrong.
Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along for the ride.

Jimmy: Woke up this morning,
I was feeling quite weird.
Had flies in my ear and my toothpaste was smeared.
Opened my window,
They had written my name.
Both: Said so long, we'll see you again.

(Chorus)
Both: Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along.
I won't do anything wrong.
Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along for the ride.

(Talking)

Rizzo: Hey you two.

Gonzo: What do you want Rizzo?

Rizzo: You won't believe this, but there's a space ship outside.

Jimmy: Oh yeah, I knew they'd come back for me.

Rizzo: What!

Jimmy: Come on boys, let's go

Gonzo: Yeah, let's go

Rizzo: No way, I'm not goin up in that thing.

Gonzo: Oh Rizzo

(Singing)

(Chorus)

Both: Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along.
I won't do anything wrong.
Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along for the ride.
Won't you please take me along for the ride.

(Talking)

Jimmy: Alright Gonzo, you ready to go?

Gonzo: Sure

Rizzo: Gonzo, you can't leave. You have to be here for the end of the album

Gonzo: Ah, yeah

Jimmy: Hey, see you later guys. I'm space bound.

Rizzo: Have a nice flight

Gonzo: Yeah, see you in the tabloids

Gonzo: Say Rizzo, is there any of that meatloaf left?

Rizzo: Nah, the was some big guy in there. I guess he ate it all.

Kermit the Frog,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine

I know I won't have you in my way
And I'll keep pushin' every single day
I know you'll say all the things you say
But I'll keep pushin' dala dala da day

All these minutes they keep on tickin'
All these limits they keep me kickin'
And most these critics that's dissin' or said I'm trippin'
Thank you for picking me up
I ain't quittin' or giving it up
Too many enemies in my path
Reality shows kiss my ass
But I'm watchin' to get those laughs
Screamin' at TV win that cash
And that's when my lady calls
Priorities or could I just stall
Next I know we're going shoppin'
Leather shoes bought 'em like big things poppin'
And that's the way love goes
Give it all till there ain't no more
Surf the net till eyes go sore
A day in the life of an average Joe
Even though I travel the globe
Rock shows come home with my head down low
Non believers zip your lips
And believe I won't quit till I reach my goals

I know I won't have you in my way
And I'll keep pushin' every single day
I know you'll say all the things you say
But I'll keep pushin' every single day

But I'll keep pushin' every single day
I know you say all the things you say
But I'll keep pushin'

Can't be pleased livin' if I'm dyin' to please
Livin' down on my knees in apologies so follow me
Look up to the universe even this verse divine property see
Love is a drug and I'm pushin' it by the keys
Living by the word incurred by the proephecies
Only god can judge me now
No walls or no falls can budge me now
If you heard me loud then scream back
Don't you forget where your dream at we map
Map The Soul all the way from Frisco back to Seoul
Never lose control
Keep pushin' don't need a fall back
No addition don't need a call back
Just make a choice
We listen, you don't have to fake your voice

I know I won't have you in my way
And I'll keep pushing every single day
I know you'll say all the things you say
But I'll keep pushing every single day
I know I won't have you in my way
And I'll keep pushing every single day
I know you'll say all the things you say

For yonder breaks

Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.

Grateful chorus raise we,

Praise His holy name!

Kerry,"Pack up all the dishes
Make a note of all good wishes
Say goodbye to the landlord for me
Aw you know he always bored me
And throw out all those LA papers
The moldy box of Vanilla Wafers
Adios to all this concrete
Gonna get me some dirt road back streets
Now here's to you old Skinny Dennis
The only one I think I will miss
I can hear those bass notes ringin
As sweet and low like a gift your bringin
So play it for me one more time now
You got to give it all you can now
Well I believe every word you're sayin
Just to keep on keepin on, keep on playin
Chorus:
Well I can just get off of this L.A. freeway
Without getting killed or caught
Down the road in a cloud of smoke
To some land that, baby, we ain't bought
If I can just get off this L.A. freeway
Leave the key card in the mailbox
Leave the key in that old front lock
They can find it likely as not
There must be somethin we have forgot
Oh, Susanna don't you cry babe
Love's a gift and truly handmade
We got somethin to believe in
Texas is callin, baby, it's time we were leavin

Kerry Butler,"Psst, Penny, what happened?
My mother's punishing me for going to jail without permission
Well, I'm here to save the fair maiden in her tower
Oh, Seaweed, Tracy, you took beautiful behind bars

It must be the low-watt institutional lighting
Oh Tracy, they can keep us from kissing
But they can't stop us from singing

Once I was a selfish fool who never understood
I never looked inside myself, though on the outside, I looked good
Then we met and you made me the man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you, no matter what you weigh 'cause

Without love, life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love, life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer
Tracy, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lyin', never set me free, Tracy
No, no, no

Once I was a simple girl, then stardom came to me
But I was still a nothing, though a thousand fans may disagree
Tracy, fame was just a prison, signing autographs a bore
I didn't have a clue 'til you came banging on my door

That without love, life is like my dad without his bromo
Without love, life is making out with Perry Como
Darling, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
So darling, throw away the key, I'm yours forever
Throw away the key, yeah, yeah, yeah

Living in the ghetto, black is everywhere ya go
Who'd 've thought I'd love a girl with skin as white as winter's snow
In my ivory tower, life was just a hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate and I'm never going back

'Cause without love, life is like a beat that you can't follow without love
Life is Doris day at the Apollo, darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause i never wanna be without love, so darling, never set me free
I'm yours forever, never set me free, no, no, no

If you're locked up in this prison, Trace, I don't know what I'll do
Link, I've got to break out, so that I can get my hands on you
And girl, if I can't touch you, now, I'm gonna lose control
Seaweed, you're my black white knight, I've found my blue-eyed soul
Sweet freedom is our goal
Trace, I wanna kiss ya, then I can't wait for parole

'Cause without love, life is like a prom that won't invite us without love
Life's getting my big break and laryngitis
Without love, life's a '45' when you can't buy it without love
Life is like my mother on a diet

Like a week that's only Mondays, only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center, like a door marked, 'Do Not Enter'
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Yes, now you've captured me without love
I surrender happily, without love

Oh seaweed, never set me free, no, no, no
No, I ain't lyin', never set me free, no, no, no
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, darling, you had best believe me
Never leave me without love

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine

And when the snow flakes fell
We had to hold on tight
Before our last farewell
Then the darkness took you from me
As you walked into the night
You said you'd never change
You'd never change your mind
And then I looked away
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me

It was a lonely night
When I was watching the TV
Lo and behold on tight
There you were singing about me
It was a lonely summer freedom
How you had to fly away
You said you'd never change
You'd never change your mind
But then I closed my eyes
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me

Now as the years go by
I still dream the same dream
But I still wonder why
Things are not what they seem
I still hear you saying baby
You will never stay the night
I guess you never change
You never change your mind
But then I closed my eyes
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me

I wanna roll with you, you, I wanna roll with you, oh oh yeah

I guess I always roll with the punches, it's so fun and games I say

Where I can find shelter 
From a hunger and a cold 
And the sweet tastin' good life 
Is so easily found 
A way over yonder, that's where I'm bound 
I know when I get there 
The first thing I'll see 
Is the sun shining golden 
Shining right down on me 
Then trouble's gonna lose me 
Worry leave me behind 
And I'll stand up proudly 
In true peace of mind 

Talkin' about

Is a place I have seen 
In a garden of wisdom

I'll find find my way 
To the land where the honey runs 
In rivers each day

She is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine,
When she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh

Toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine,
She is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache.
Tangerine,
With her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame.

But she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine!",Tangerine,1988

To touch their harps of gold
