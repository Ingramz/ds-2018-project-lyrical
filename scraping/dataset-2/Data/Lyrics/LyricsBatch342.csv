Hank Snow,"I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
I want to be with all the kanes and wahines that I knew long ago
I can hear old guitars a playing, on the beach at Hoonaunau
I can hear the Hawaiians saying ""Komomai no kaua ika hale welakahao""
It won't be long 'til my ship will be sailing back to Kona
A grand old place that's always fair to see
I'm just a little Hawaiian and a homeside Island boy
I want to go back to my fish and poi
I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
Where the Humuhumu, Nukunuku a puaa goes swimming by

Hank Snow,"There is but one real religion that redeems a sinners soul
It's as timeless as the ages and it never will grow old
My Lord Jesus, he's the power.I am the way, the truth, the life
And the way has never changed since he spoke the words out loud.

My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine, two and two maker four to-day as it did in my Lord's time.
Modern day won't make a difference that you can't follow through the time,
My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine.

In this world of wild confusion, we are often led astray.
When we hear the word 'old fashioned' as men speak of God to-day.
My Lord doesn't deal in fashion, He's more timeless than the seas
And Hjs words still hold the power as they did in Gallilee.

My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine
Two and two make four to-day as it did in my Lord's time.
Modern days won't make a difference you can't follow through the time.
My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine.

Some are prone to yake the bible and Usurp the words of Christ.
They admit He came here one time but He'll never make it twice.
Do not tempt the bible's prophecies as such men rue their life
There is darkness in their future but there's life in Jesus Christ.

My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine
Two and two make four to-day as it did in my Lord's time
Modern days won't make a difference you can't follow through the time
My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine.",My Religion's Not Old Fashioned (But It's Real Genuine),1994
Hank Snow,"While looking through my jewelry drawer
Beneath some paper, there I saw
An address book I'd kept throughout the years
It listed all the girls on it

Friends, my list sure has grown
Each name brings back the laughter and the tears
There were girls that I'd romance with
Girls that I had dance with

Some whose face that I just can't recall
There were girls I kissed and lied to
Some I couldn't, and though I tried to
The name of the game was love

And I played it with them all
There was Mary, Martha, Diana, Eva, Josie
Hannah, Anna, Sally, Beth and Rosie
Bonnie, Connie, Susan and Cindy

You get Claudette, Emma and a Minsy
Janet, Gina, Ingrid or a Bessie
Florance, Fanny, surely gonna test us
Francie, Nora, Alice, even Dolly

Gertie, Gretchen, Carmelita and Molly
Girls of every nation, each one a new temptation
They were great, I sure had a ball
They are girls that I had courted

Girls whose marriage plans I hoarded
The name of the game was love
And I played it with them all
There was Betty, Ann, Carol and Yuanita

Hank Snow,"Everyone knows about Rudolph
Our fleet-footed friend from the north
Who lights Santa's way through the darkness
As he drives his sleigh back and forth
But there's someone else we should mention
If we want the whole story told
He carried the first gift of Christmas
More precious than diamonds or gold

Nestor was a donkey who seldom laughed or played
'Cause no one evey used him in the stable where he stayed
And all the camels teased him, the other donkeys too
They said, look at little Nestor, there's nothin' he can do

Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
When he looks at his reflection, ears are all he sees
Nestor's heart was broken and his eyes were full of tears
If only there was somethin' he could do about his ears

One dark night two strangers gave Nestor a surprise
They chose him from all others for they loved his gentle eyes
A man was called by Joseph, Mary was his bride
She needed help to Bethlehem and Nestor's back to ride

They travelled through the desert but hadn't gone too far
When winter clouds no longer let them see their guiding star
But Nestor learned a secret as he listened to the breeze
And the angels gave directions to  the ears that touched his knees

Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
When he looks at his reflection, ears are all he sees
Nestor's heart was broken and his eyes were full of tears
If only there was somethin' he could do about his ears

And so it was that Nestor found the manger where they stayed
Where kings and wise men bowed before the baby where he lay
Mary bore our Saviour and Nestor brought them there
A gift of love from God above for all the world to share

Though, Rudolph, I just love you, I know you'd want it said
Nestor's ears are lovely as a reindeer's nose is red
So children, if you're happy when you trim your Christmas trees
You might thank a little donkey whose ears hung to his knees

Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
They shouted as they praised him and his friends were all so pleased
Nestor was so happy and his eyes held no more tears
Now all the world knows Nestor for his laughter and his ears","Nestor, the Long Eared Christmas Donkey",1994
Hank Snow,"I'm just as blue as I can be since Susie said goodbye to me
My life is a failure I see and she won't be mine gal no mo' no mo' no mo'
I'll pack my things and drip take me a long ocean trip
Out on the great big steamship she'll never see her daddy no mo' no mo' no mo'
Still I hate to say farewell to my mammy and my sister Nell
Then she'll gonna cry when I tell that I ain't comin' home no mo' no mo' no mo'
I may be sorry someday that I leave here and go away
But they need not ask me stay for I'll never change my mind no mo' no mo' no mo'

Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea
While you're away oh then remember me

Birds cuddle down in their nest soon all the world will be sleeping
And now is the hour...",Now Is the Hour,1994
Hank Snow,"In Nuevo Laredo the moon is aglow in Nuevo Laredo in old Mexico
In Nuevo Laredo in old Mexico
The other tourists they're spending their dough
But she spends her time singing love songs you see

And everytime she sang a song she thre a kiss to me
In Nuevo Laredo the moon is aglow in Nuevo Laredo in old Mexico
In Nuevo Laredo the blue Rio Grande
Was bright in the moonlight as I held her hand

She sang me a love song the whole lovely night
We kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed intil the the morning light
In Nuevo Laredo the moon is aglow in Nuevo Laredo in old Mexico
In Nuevo Laredo I found true romance

With my senorita I sang and I danced
We had a fiesta from morning till night
And then her father caught us crumble for a fight
In Nuevo Laredo I travel no more

Since her father hollered don't darken my door
But each night by moonlight I'm all happy man
You should see me swim to her across the Rio Grande
In Nuevo Laredo the moon is aglow in Nuevo Laredo in old Mexico",Nuevo Laredo,1994
Hank Snow,"Old Father Time has seen a million, million hearts
Break with pain down the highway of years.
I never dreamed that the love I thought was true
Would deceive and just leave me these tears.

The little seeds of happiness I grew with tender care
Have withered now that fate has played its part.
And my bud of love has closed, I have lost THE ONLY ROSE
That was blooming in the garden of my heart.

Mister Moon, I wonder, as you gaze from up above
On my broken heart that love has cast away.
If there's just one trace of sadness on my darlings face tonight,
Will she bloom within my heart again some day.

Will the weeds and briars vanish where the tears of sorrow fell,
And let the seeds of romance play its part.
Or must I go on living with just mem'ries of a rose
That once blossomed in the garden of my heart.",The One Rose (That's Left in My Heart),1994
Hank Snow,"Everyone knows it's all over I told them the things that we've planned
But they never see you walking with me and somehow they don't understand
Oh let's forget this sorrow and a pair of broken hearts
We must face each blue tomorrow with a pair of broken hearts
True love never had a chance dear when a foolish quarrel starts
So we paid for our romance dear with a pair of broken hearts

True love never has a chance dear",A Pair of Broken Hearts,1994
Hank Snow,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina music would play and Feleena would whirl
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I loved
So in danger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore

My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there

I had but one chance and that was to run
Out to the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso

Out to the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet would find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina below

My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor

Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest

I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheeks as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena goodbye",El Paso,1994
Hank Snow,"Pearly Shells, from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering up the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you,
More than all the little pearly shells

For every grain of sand upon the beach
I got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over
For each star
That twinkles in the blue
Pearly shells, from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering up the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you 
More than all the little pearly shells

For every grain of sand upon the beach
I've got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over
For each star

Hank Snow,"Here's a rose from my garden
Where the bloom of romance grows
But I'll keep on a part near my aching heart
Just a petal from a faded rose
Love'd be sweet in the morning
When the breeze of summer blows
But will fade and die when the wind is nigh
Like a petal from a faded rose

Now our love is a memory
Where it's gone nobody knows
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir
Just a petal from a faded rose
(I will live with the roses Where the sea of memory flows)
And each time I dream then a tear will gleam
On this petal from a faded rose",A Petal from a Faded Rose,1994
Hank Snow,"Chorus:
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty for the same

Into each life a love is born for one
And one alone dear
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul sear
And I know our love was never meant to be

Chorus

But still my heart cries out for you
And you alone my darling
It makes me  never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And my better judgement tells me to say no

Chorus",Poison Love,1994
Hank Snow,"Oh I wish I had someone to love me yes someone to call me their own
Oh I wish I had someone to live with cause I'm tired of living all alone
Please meet me tonight in the moonlight please meet me tonight all alone
For I had a sad story to tell you it's a story that's never been told

(I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow leaving my poor darling all alone)
With the cold prison bars all around me and my head on a pillow of stone
Now I have a grand ship out on the ocean all mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer that ship would be anchored and sold

Now if I had the wings of an angel over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darling and there I'd be willing to die",The Prisoner's Song,1994
Hank Snow,"Return to me for my dear I'm so lonely
Hurry back hurry back oh my love I am yours hurry back
Return to me for my heart wants you only
Hurry home hurry home won't you please hurry home to my heart
My darling if I hurt you I'm sorry forgive me and please say you are mine

Hank Snow,"Sitting alone in an old rocking chair 
I saw an old mother with silvery hair 
She seemed so neglected by those who should care 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

Her hands were all callused and wrinkled and old 
A life of hard work was the story they told 
And I thought of angels as I saw her there 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

Bless her old heart, do you think she'd complain 
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again 
And carry that cross that is more than her share 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart 
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part 
A letter would brighten her empty life there 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

I know some youngsters in an orphans' home 
Who'd think they owned heaven if she was their own 
They'd never be willing to let her sit there 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

I look at her and I think ""What a shame"" 
The ones who forgot her she loves just the same 
And I think of angels as I see her there 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair",Rocking Alone in an Old Rocking Chair,1994
Hank Snow,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They'd never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history
Then one foggy Christmas Eve

Hank Snow,"Rough him up and shove him down
Make him cry when he comes 'round
Treat him any way you want
After all he's just runt, just a little runt

Runt is what they called him
But his name was Buddy Grey
He lived out on Maple Street
'Bout a mile away

Hand-me-downs were all he wore
Poverty and nothing more
Always someone laying for ? the runt

They catch him in the school year 
When he came out to play
Then get him in a circle
Where he couldn't get away

They'd shove him here 
And they'd shove him there
If he fell down, nobody cared
Just anything to keep him scared - the runt

Then one day walking home from school
The teasing went just too far
They chased the runt out in the street
Nobody saw the car

They only heard that awful sound
They saw the broken body on the ground
Then everybody gathered around - the runt

They buried him on Sunday
His classmates all were there
And the tears filled each every eye
When runt's mother said a prayer

Lord, even though you've taken him
I think I understand
He's finished the job you've sent him for
And done it like you planned

If you made all people to look the same
It just wouldn't be right I guess
So you put a few now and then, like my runt
To bring others' happiness

His shortness makes others feel tall
His weakness makes others feel strong
His features make others feel pretty and handsome
And his sadness brings others a song

So rough him up and shove him down
Make him cry when he comes 'round
Treat him any way you want
But thank God for the runt
Yes, thank God for my little runt",The Runt,1994
Hank Snow,"She wears my my ring 
To show the world 
That she belongs to me
She wears my ring 
To show the world 
She's mine eternally
With loving care 
I placed it on her finger 
To show my love 
For all the world to see

Of tender emotions

Hank Snow,"Shopworn and aged what's left of a man
Will never be useless cause he's part of God's plan
Did you ever think of life as just a shop along the street
And yourself as a product displayed in easy reach
You laid there for some quite some time now and pondered at your fate
Then you begin to wonder if you'd hit the market late
Wealth had looked you over once and seen you at your best
But somehow you didn't fit his needs so he took one of the rest
Sweet love had read your label and you lingered in her mind
But competition caught her eye and she left you there behind
Fame had brushed the edges or the counter where you laid
And she pondered for a moment but then she walked away
Lady Luck had even picked you up but then you heard her say
I just can't afford you so I'll just have to let you lay
Then one day they marked you down put you up on sale
And you got looked over once again all to no avail
Now stained with yellow marked with age you heard a salesman state
Boss I guess I'll throw this out it's old and out of date
The keeper of the shop came then and he seemed to understand
He smiled and looked you over then held out a caring hand
Give me that I'll take it home don't throw it on the street
It's old and gray but in its way it'll help my shop complete
Shopworn and aged",Shopworn,1994

Hank Snow,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away

Hank Snow,"I met a girl in Laredo down in Mexico
While I was makin' the rounds
Down in a dim cafe she does the swing and sway
That's the talk of the town
I never learned her name
But she's called the Spanish Fireball

While she kept rhythm with her hips
From her ruby lips came a love song so bright
And as she rumbaed by the fire in her eyes
Looked like flames in the night
T'was then I understood why she's called
The Spanish Fireball

I finally asked her for a dance
And I got the chance holding her closely to me
While we were cheek to cheek I grew too weak to speak
And it was plain to see
That I had fallen in love with this
Cute little Spanish Fireball

She wore a ruby bracelet and a blue white diamond
Upon her little brown hand
She made a perfect date and in her Cadillac eight
Love began to expand
I played the part and gave my heart to The Spanish Fireball

We wandered out beneath the stars
While the old guitars strummed a Mexican tune
And as I stole a kiss I knew too well that this
Would all end too soon
'Cause I must go away and leave My Spanish Fireball

As that old moon was sinkin' low
I heard the whistle blow my train was pulling in sight
And so we kissed goodbye
The tears were in her eyes as I left in the night
But someday I 'll go back and claim My Spanish Fireball",Spanish Fireball,1994

That I'm back where I belong
Just a country hick way back in the stick 
Back where I was born
Cause the city lights and the city ways 
Are drivin' me insane
I want to be alone I want to be back home 
Out on the Texas plains

I want to drink my java from an old tin can 
While the moon comes shinin' high
I want to hear the call of a whippoorwill 
I want to hear a coyote whine
I want to feel my saddle horse between my legs 
Just riding him out on the range
Just to kick him in the sides let him show 
His step and pride out on the Texas plains

I want to hear the thunder as it goes and rolls 
I want to feel the rain in my face
Just a thousand miles from the city lights 
Living a cowboy ways
I want to sleep at night beneath the stars above
With that whole moon shinin' down
I want to cook my grabbel with catfish skulls 
Fifty miles from town
I want to drink my java

Sometime soon I'm goin' back back 
Where the skies are blue
In a little house just built for two 
Back where my dreams come true
Well I'm tired of subways 
And the forty story shacks
I'm tradin' the wide open range

Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold

I reached toward the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug we did our dance on a Kodiak rug

Memories that make my heart grow cold,
Someday we'll live them all again,
When my blue moon again will turn to gold.

When my blue moon turns to gold again,
When the raindrops turn the clouds away,
When my blue moon turns to gold again,
You'll be back here in my arms to stay.

Verse2:
The castles we built in dreams together
Tell the sweetest story ever told,
Someday we'll live them all again

Your kisses were meant for only me.
Someday we'll live them all again,
When my golden moon is just a memory.

I would dream of my Blue Velvet Band.

Like a flash by my bedside was standing
The form of my Blue Velvet Band.

Just to go back and make her my bride

And would reap every sorrow and care;

As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,

All of how two lovers parted,
Of their sorrow, pain and tears.

I am another who's heartbroken,
And I'm in this lonesome jail
I was the honest ranger,
Tried for fame but soon I failed.

I was a cowboy singer,
And I played the old guitar,
But my mind was set on roaming,
I started out for lands a-far.

Soon fell with bad companions,
And we robbed the Western mail
Shot and killed some helpless lady,
As I think my face grows pale.

I had a pretty sweet heart,
And she though the world of me,
But we parted at the station,
Down in sunny Tennessee.

Last night from her I got a letter,
Saying, ""I can never be your bride""
As the moon shone though my window,
I bowed my head and cried.

Down in dear old Lover's Lane,
I must spend my life in prison,
I pray on high we'll meet again.",Prisoned Cowboy,1994

There is someone who waits far away
One who's kneeling in prayer as she waits for me there
Asking that I might comeback some day.
Her hands are all wrinkled with care
The gold has all gone from her hair
How I long to caress her my mother God bless her
She's a rose from the garden of prayer.

When I was a boy at her knee
She was more than a mother to me
As I gaze into space I can see her sweet face
As I stood by her old rocking chair.
When cares would impress on my brow
Or someone would turn me away
She would always be near me to comfort and cheer me
She's a rose from the garden of prayer.

So I'm leaving and heading that way
To a mother so feeble and grey
Where she waits there alone in our Heaven called home
By the window she's watching for me.
Soon my sorrows and troubles will end
Where all nature is blooming so fair
And I'll rest in the arms of the one that is true

It was the last one from her darlin' boy

""Dear mom"" was the way that it started
""I miss you so much"" it went on
Mom, I didn't know that I love you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won

I'm writing this down in a trench mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did when I was a kid
And came home with mud on my feet

Now the captain just gave us our orders
And mom we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you

Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darlin' boy had died

That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep our Canada free",Soldier's Last Letter,1994
Hank Snow,"Traveling the lonely roads of sorrow,
Heartaches are all I've ever known.
Time has turned a million pages,
Fate has dealt and I'm alone.

[Chorus]
But somewhere along life's highway
From your new love you may part,
And you will reap the pains, my darling,
That go with a broken heart.

The little stars all twinkled brighter,
The moon smiled gaily from the blue.
The flowers seemed to spread more beauty
Oh, so glad 'cause I met you.

Though you've made my life a failure,
I have never been untrue.
And these lonely years have wasted,
All because my love for you.

You played your game to leave me darling,
Your game I did not understand.
So you dealt the cards against me
And I played the losing hand.

Hank Snow,"Don't forget me little darling while I'm growing old and gray
Just a little thought before I'm going far away
I'll be waiting on the hillside where the wild red roses grow
On the sunny side of the mountains where the rippling waters flow

Don't forget about those days we courted many years ago
Don't forget all those promises you gave me and so
I'll be waiting on the hillside for the day you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall

Please tell me darling in your letter do you think of me
Please answer little darling tell me where you can be
It's been so long since I've seen you but your love still lingers on
Don't forget me little darling though our love affair is gone.""",Sunny Side of the Mountain,1994
Hank Snow,"Boys I was born in Texas State, 
Many years ago,
I've rode on ev'ry range and plain, 
There's no place I don't know

I love to swing the lariat, 
That's all I'll ever do, 
I'm a two-gun singing cowboy 
And I've never had the blues.

For I hop on my old Pinto, 
And o'er the plains we ride,
Just swingin' in the saddle, 
My guitar hangs by my side

Old Pinto's always willing, 
As for me I'm never sad,
You'll find there beats an honest heart 
In this old Texas lad.

I sleep out on the rolling plains, 
My blanket for a bed, 
Waiting for the break of day 
To ride out to the herd

I'll mount my old cow-pony, 
Wear my boots and Stetson too,
And ride all day on Texas plains 
Beneath the skies of blue.

Now when my cheque of life I cash 
For the land beyond the sky,
I'm goin' to ride old Pinto out 
Across that Great Divide

I'll ride the last great Round-up 
Far across the Golden Plains,
Well boys, I hope you liked my song, 
I'm on my way again.

Hank Snow,"On an ocean of dreams 
I have wandered it seems
Just wanderin', wanderin' on,
Since I found the note, sweetheart 
That you wrote just sayin'
That you had already gone.

[Chorus]
Will the pretty bird sing?
Will the roses in the Spring
Still blossom when they find 
That you have gone?
Will the old pals be true
Or will they all leave me too?

Just wanderin', wanderin' on
Will the little brook play
As it winds along its way?
Will the stars keep on shinin' 
Tho' you've gone
Will they find their way to you
Will they tell you that I'm blue
Or will they too leave me wanderin' on?

Tho' you've left me and gone 
I'll keep wanderin' on
Wanderin' down life's way
And beneath the lovely blue 
I may wander back to you
And my dreams will all come true someday.

Hank Snow,"Another cryin' night will soon be over now
The morning light won't help, I'll still be blue
'Cause everywhere I turn there's only loneliness
Memories are all I can hold to

Memories are the moments when we were as one
Memories you would only hope to find
Memories, in your loving arms, you'd whisper my name
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine

All these memories are locked within my heart
My world was gone the moment I lost you
If wants could talk, they'd tell you of the tears I've cried
But memories are all I can hold to

Hank Snow,"They heard the breeze in the trees making weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill high on a hill they took a new note
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note
And then they nursed it and rehearsed it and gave out with the news
That the southland gave birth of the blues

Hank Snow,"I rode your ocean liner to Newfoundland,
Where I made a living in an iron mine.
When I got my fill I went to Nova Scotia,
And I fished the salty waters for a time.

Passing through Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick,
I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone.
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other
Made me miss my darling and my distant home.

Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,
Through the valleys and the forests,
To the sunshine of her smile,
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,
Keep this wandering boy from harm.
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.

The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon,
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track.
For a while I drove a truck to keep from star-ving.
In Ontario I was a lumber-jack.

Man-itoba and Saskatchewan then followed,
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed.
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie,
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow.

I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound.
I worked on an oil rig to make some money,
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around.

Pushing on past Lake Louise in all it's splendor,
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above,
I got to British Columbia and heaven,
On your track I made it back to my true love.

Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,
Through the valleys and the forests,
To the sunshine of her smile.

Keep this wandering boy from harm.

Hank Snow,"Ridin' on the City of New Orleans Illinois Central Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders 3 conductors and 24 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train rolls out of Kankakee
And moves along past houses farms and fields

Passin' trains that have no name and switchyards full of old black men
Of graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good mornin' America how are you say don't ya know me I'm your native son
I'm a train they call the City of New Orleans

I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
Dealin' cards with an old man on the club car many a point nobody's keepin' score
Hey now pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels a rumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their daddy's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babies asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Night time on the City of New Orleans changin' cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home and we'll be there by mornin'
Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream

And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again the passengers will please refrain

Watching people come and people go and feeling so alone
And every face I see reminds me of the one I've left behind me crying
Knowing I should go back home and heaven knows how hard I'm trying

To see that Colorado country morning with the dusty roads and warm sunshine
I've got the Colorado country morning and a Denver woman on my mind
I remember standing at the door and looking back as she lay sleeping

And very gently through the window pane the morning sun was creeping
And without a sound I turned around and softly kissed her goodbye
Now with all behind I often find myself wondering why
I left that Colorado country morning

And that tears are only rain to make love grow
For my love for you could never grow no stronger

He remembers the first time he held her and the night that she came to his bed
He remembers her sweet day of saying honey has something gone wrong
He remembers the fun and the teasin' and the reason he wrote her this song
I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day
I'll love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away

They would walk down the street in the evening and for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam in their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy and I'd love to go tagging along
We'd hold hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing her his song
I'll give you a daisy...
[ fiddle ]
Now he walks down the street in the evening and he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe he's believing he's holding her hand like before
For he feels all her love walking with him and he smiles at the things she might say
Then the old man walks up to the hilltop and he gives her a daisy a day
I'll give you a daisy...

They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free

I still run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find

As the train pulls into the station
I can see Peggy waiting there for me
But I can tell there's something wrong
She's not the happy girl she used to be
Peggy hasn't said much
As she drives along the road back to our farm
And she ignored the question
When I asked her where she got this pretty car.

As she pulled into the driveway
I can see she's planted flowers all around
I'm surprised to see good paint
I thought the place would surely be run down
I said Peggy you've done wonders
And I wonder how you've done it on your own
She said I had to hire a hand
I never could have run this farm alone.

CHANGE TO D:
[D] Then Peggy started cryin' and she said
There's something that you have to [E] see
There's a [A] little boy inside
And you should know that he is only [D] three
We went inside and Peggy said
I'm sorry but there's nothing I can [E] do
But if [A] you'll let us stay here
I'll try my best to make it up to [D] you.

The little boy looked frightened
At the thin man who has come in from the cold
He hides behind his mother's skirt
As she bends down to wipe his little nose
I said Peggy, I still love you
And I'll do my best to try to understand
For God has pardoned both of us
And don't the Governor write a pretty hand?

Then [A] Peggy dried her tears when I said
Don't the Governor write a pretty [D] hand?

Will there be any freight trains in heaven any boxcars in which we might hide

It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart
And I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when I came home from working late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes one day while I wasn't home while she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey and I wake up nights
And call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played
And love grew up

Hank Snow,"Well I had a friend named Gambling Bob he used to steal gamble and rob
He thought was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday that Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town
He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit playin' cards and a shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
[ fiddle - steel ]
Well I went out last Tuesday met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money and she started to call me honey
We took in every cabarete in town
We're in the jailhouse now we're in the jailhouse now
I've told the judge right to his face we didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

Hank Snow,"In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you (as long as I'm with you-ooh)

In a far-away land
On the tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue

Way up on the mountain
Or way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy
Anyplace, anywhere, I don't care

[Chorus]
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

I could be happy in one little room with only a table and chair. As happy as I'd be in a kingdom 
by the sea, darling, if you were there. And I could be rich or I could be poor, but if you were by my side, 
I could be any place in this whole wide world and I know I'd be satisfied.

'Cause I won't be around one who has rules for me to follow

Over and over I practice every day
What to say when I see you but when I see you my tears get in the way
Just bidin' my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me
I spend my nights making up things I might have to say to you

And I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Have gone by since we shared our dreams

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

There on the outside you all can laugh I don't need your sympathy
For after I'm paid for the liquor I've sold
Gonna leave this place worth my weight in gold
So why did I stray from the rightous path nobody knows but me

For all the love she had for him had pled
But he sought her out at last with her partners for the past
But her mother met him in the door and said
She was happy till she met you the fault is all your own
Id she wishes to forget you please leave her alone
She has come to her old mother because there is no other
She'll be happy in her home sweet home

And once again to him she calmly said

For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs

With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something

And there's nothing short of dying

With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

'Cause her head was full of flashin' neon lights

Twas that big old shiny diesel as it rounded Carter's bend
Was enough to make a young girl want to roam
She'd pretend she rode those shiny rails all around the world
And had the Texas Silver Zephyr bring her home

As summer work was over and restless got to me
I kept talkin' 'bout the places I would go
Then her young head got to spinnin' for the things she'd never seen
So she followed me to Denver in the fall

Then jobs got scarce in central Colorado
And then the winter nights got awful cold
Just one old army blanket was the only one we had
No money for the oil to run the stove

Yes, that big old shiny diesel as it rounded Carter's bend
Was enough to make a young girl want to roam
But through all those hungry nights the only promise that I made
I had the Texas Silver Zephyr take her home

When she started feelin' bad, she didn't tell me
She had a way of keepin' problems all her own
So I didn't know her troubles with the baby
Before I could get a doctor, she was gone

Lord, I know it's not the way she really wanted things to be
In her dreams she had a pull man all her own
But she'd be proud of me to know I kept my promise
And had the Texas Silver Zephyr take her home
And had the Texas Silver Zephyr take her home",The Texas Silver Zephyr,1995
Hank Snow,"Here's the house where we once lived 
That I had love too much to give
For the girl who said that she'll be mine
And here's the room where we both slept 
And when she laughed that's where I wept
We had love so very hard to find
There's the chair that held the man 
That held the girl that held the hand
That wore the ring that I no longer wear
And there's the clock that used to chime 
But I've lost track of telling time
And there's a picture I see everywhere
In the kitchen where she cooks 
I can see her recipe book
And on the table there's her favorite glass
In the dynama afraid do look cause 
I will see that leather book
Sunday morning she was first to class

I pull up shades I pull up blinds 
'Cause it's gone the tie that binds
It's broken now but God knows I still care
Sometimes love is not too pretty 
When you find it's gone
I guess now I lose my mind I already lost a home
I walk these halls a hollow man 
I'm tryin' to do the best I can
But I can't walk away from yesterday
I try to be a stirin' man 
And rule her with an iron hand
But somehow too much love come in the way
There's the chair that held the man 
That held the girl that held the hand
That wore the ring that I no longer wear
And here's the beer that I would drink 
To stop the mind that wants to think
About the girl who said she didn't care
There's the chair that held the man 
That held the girl that held the hand
That wore the ring that I no longer wear",There's the Chair,1995

To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else

You told me a lie 
For ev'ry cross-tie

You were gonna be wed.

Looked like flames in the night

Upon her little brown hand

Why do you punish me for loving you,
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours?
Why do you sentence me to nights of tears?
Convicting all these dreams I've dreamed for years?

My heart cries out behind these prison bars,
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free.
Why do you punish me? Is love a crime?
If so I'll spend a lifetime loving, serving time.

Hank Snow,"In a certain city, where 
The girls are cute and pretty, 
They have a raggy jazzy jazz time tune. 
When you hear that syncopated 
Jazz created melody 
You could dance all morning 
Night and noon, 
When the slide trombone 
And moaning saxophone begin to play. 
It will make you sad, 
'Twill make you glad

What Joy, 
Burn my clothes for I'm in Heaven, 
Wish I had a million women,

Could have told another story, 
Were he but living here today, 
With his thousand wives or more, 
A Jazz Band on some Egypt shore, 
He could dance the night and day away. 
I will tell you how they dance 
That tantalizing 12th. Street Rag. 
 
First you slide and then you glide, 
Then shimmie for a while; 
To the left then to the right 

""Lame Duck"" ""Get over Sal"" 
Watch your step then Pirouette, 
Fox Trot, then squeeze your pal 
Over you comes stealing 
Such a funny feeling 
'Til you feel 
Your senses reeling, 
Tantalizing, hypnotizing, 
Mesmerizing strain, 
I can't get enough of it 
Please play it o'er again

Just a little old shanty by a railroad track
The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry

I've got the freight train blues, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go
Oh Lordy, guess I'm never gonna lose
The mean old freight train blues

Now my pappy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of an engineer
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

Hank Snow,"1.What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

2. All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

3. All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

4. Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

5. She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

6. In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

7. I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

8. When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.

Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth, a jewel for Heaven
More precious than diamonds, more precious than gold

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to Heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has it wealth, its trials and troubles
Mother Earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can't hold the soul of one precious jewel

They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

That's been tellin' your troubles to me.
You told me a lie 
For ev'ry cross-tie 
From Frisco to old Tennessee.
Nobody knew your little game; 
Ev'rybody gave me the blame.

In the smoke and the fog 
Of this old switchyard
And that dreary whistle's farewell.

And when I find you I'm movin' in.

I was the one that deceived,
That I drove you to the things you'd done.
Said you loved me in vain 
And our old love train
Had made it's final run.

You were gonna be wed.

And meet this old S. P.

Get out on the old main line.

It's been so dog-gone long, 
You know you've done your daddy wrong.

I hear you callin' aloud,
Standin' in the station door.

Hank Snow & His Rainbow Ranch Boys,"I met a girl in Laredo down in Mexico
While I was makin' the rounds
Down in a dim cafe she does the swing and sway
That's the talk of the town
I never learned her name
But she's called the Spanish Fireball

While she kept rhythm with her hips
From her ruby lips came a love song so bright
And as she rumbaed by the fire in her eyes
Looked like flames in the night
T'was then I understood why she's called
The Spanish Fireball

I finally asked her for a dance
And I got the chance holding her closely to me
While we were cheek to cheek I grew too weak to speak
And it was plain to see
That I had fallen in love with this
Cute little Spanish Fireball

She wore a ruby bracelet and a blue white diamond
Upon her little brown hand
She made a perfect date and in her Cadillac eight
Love began to expand
I played the part and gave my heart to The Spanish Fireball

We wandered out beneath the stars
While the old guitars strummed a Mexican tune
And as I stole a kiss I knew too well that this
Would all end too soon
'Cause I must go away and leave My Spanish Fireball

As that old moon was sinkin' low
I heard the whistle blow my train was pulling in sight
And so we kissed goodbye
The tears were in her eyes as I left in the night
But someday I 'll go back and claim My Spanish Fireball",Spanish Fireball,2014

Hank Thompson,"MY ROUGH AND ROWDY WAYS
(Jimmie Rodgers)
Â« Â© '29 Peer International Â»

For years and years I've rambled drank my wines and gambled
But one day I thought I'd settle down
I met a perfect lady she said she'd be my baby
We built a cottage in the old hometown
But somehow I can't forget my good old rambling days
The railroad trains are calling me away
I may be rough I may be wild I may be tough and countrified
But I can't give up my good old rough and rowdy ways
Sometimes I meet a bounder who knew me when I was a rounder
He grabs my hand and says boy have a drink
We'd go down to the poolroom get in the gang and then soon
The daylight comes before I'd had a wink
But somehow I can't forget...



",My Rough and Rowdy Ways,1969
Hank Thompson,"Pop a top again I just got time for one more round 
Sit 'em up my friends 
Then I'll be gone 

Then you can let some other fool sit down 
I'd like for you'd to listen to a joke I heard today 
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away 
I'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place 
Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streaming down his face. 

Pop a top again I think I'll have another round 
Sit 'em up my friend Then I'll be gone 
And you can let some other fool sit down. 

Home for me is misery and here I am wasting time 
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind 
But then you see her leaving me it's not what I prefer 
So it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her. 

Pop a top again I think I'll have another round 
Sit 'em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down 
Pop a top again.",Pop a Top,1969

Â« Â© '50 Hill & Range Songs Â»

That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
Cause I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky so I'm movin' on
That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free and I'm movin' on
Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let this rattle a roll and keep movin' me on
Mister engineer take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
You're gonna ease my mind put me there on time and keep rollin' on
I told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You've broken your vow and it's all over now so I'm movin' on
You switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a trifling woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin' on I'm rollin' on
I've warned you twice now you can settle the price cause I'm movin' on
But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on you stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue keep movin' on



",I'm Movin' On,1973
Hank Thompson,"You left me and you went away, 
You said that you'd be back in just a day, 
You've broken your promise and you left me all alone,
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone. 

[Chorus]
I'm walking the floor over you, 
I can't sleep a wink that is true. 
I'm hoping and I'm praying 
As my heart breaks right in two, 
Walking the floor over you. 

Now darling you know I love you well, 
I love you more than I can ever tell, 
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine, 
But you went and left me here with troubled mind. 

[Chorus]

Now someday you may be lonesome too, 
Walking the floor is good for you. 
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry, 
Remember that I love you and I will until I die. 

[Chorus]",Walking the Floor over You,1973
Hank Thompson,"Someone must have known that I was lonely
That's why they sent you to me from above
I know someone must have heard me crying
And gave me such an angel that I love

[Chorus]
Who left the door to heaven open
Who turned their head for a moment
Who told you that my heart was broken
And who left the door to heaven open

Heaven just can't be the same without you
I guess you must have been their brightest star
And, tonight, I know the angels all will miss you
But they know just exactly where you are

[Chorus]",Who Left the Door to Heaven Open,1980
Hank Thompson,"You're breakin' in another heart
To take the place of mine
The kind of love I gave to you
Is very hard to find

You're breakin' in another heart
To try to take my place
But have I left of memory
That time cannot erase

Can you find another one
Who'll love you like I do?
One who thinks, you're everything
His world is only you

Now that you have made the change
I don't think you will find
The heart that you're breakin' in
Will be as true as mine

When you made him love you so
And talkin' what to be
I wonder when you kiss his lips
Will you think of me?

It's hard to start my life again
But what else can I do?
You're breakin' in another heart
But mine you've broken too",Breakin' in Another Heart,1989
Hank Thompson,"Breakin' the rules every time I hug and kiss you darling
While you wear another's name
If you're breakin' the rules in any kind of game you're playing reckless
And taking chances just the same

Can it be a sin to love you like I do
And we'd just be called a pair of fools
If it's so wrong to want to be with you my darling
Then I guess I'll go on breakin' rules

Can it be a sin",Breakin' the Rules,1989
Hank Thompson,"Oh Lordy me
I feel so bad this mornin'
A but I won't be feelin' bad too long
I'm headed for Hangover Tavern

My head is heavy
My spirit's kinda of low
And every time I feel this way
To Hangover Tavern I go

Well, this bar I'm talkin' about
The shades are pulled down
To keep the sunshine out
The beer is poured in a frosty cup
The good bartender cheers you up

Sayin', hey Lordy me
If you feel bad this mornin'
Then watch your blues just fade away
At Hangover Tavern today

Oh Lordy me
When I woke up this mornin'
I just had to make my way
On down to Hangover Tavern

My throat is dry
There's a [Incomprehensible] around my eye
But I'll have lots of company
At Hangover Tavern for me

On Saturday night we stay out late
The very next day we congregate
I just can't wait for the very first round
Tell the man to turn the jukebox down

Hank Thompson,"Don't be fooled by big blue eyes
By a smile or a golden curl
For she'll love you now
And then break every vow
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Don't be fooled by kisses
Or arms that hold you tight
There will be another
In her arms tomorrow night

Hearts to her are toy tops
She likes to watch 'em whirl
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

You can never change her ways
Though you give her all the world
She's got more than one or two
And each day there's someone new
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her
Is just a way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool
And you're another one

She knows all the arts of love
She'll give your heart a twirl
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Don't be fooled by kisses

Hank Thompson,"[Chorus]
I've got a Humpty Dumpty heart
You dropped it and broke it apart
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Could never put it together again

But when I gave to you my heart
You said that we must part
That was my doom, my heart went boom
I got a Humpty Dumpty heart

Now, my heart is a fragile thing
When dropped it won't bounce or ring
It ain't no joke 'cause when it's broke
No love song will it sing

[Chorus]

But when I gave to you my heart
You said that we must part
That was my doom, my heart went boom

I didn't think you were that sort
When I handed you my heart
You got it on a platter but you let it shatter

Hank Thompson,"Many months have come and gone
Since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned
Many a lesson I have learned
Yet I feel like in those hills, I still belong

[Chorus]
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born

But as I sit here today
Many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

[Chorus]

As I turn life a page to the land of the great Osage
To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow-white cotton grows
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

I never want to hurt her, the way that you hurt me
Because I know she loves me, the way you used to do
And she's just a whole lot like you

She tells me little sweet things, the way you used to do
A million years ago when our love was fresh and new
I hear you when she talks and I see you when she walks

And now I'm waiting, waiting in the lobby of your heart
I'm on the doorstep, yet we're so far apart
Many times I tried, you wouldn't let me come inside
Now I'm waiting, waiting in the lobby of your heart

Everybody sang Irene goodnight
But she wouldn't go to bed no matter what they said 
Though everybody tried with all their might.
She stayed awake while steel guitars were a going
In every honky-tonk she could be seen
But she finally went to bed and covered up her head 
And now there's not a thing can wake Irene

Wake up Irene you've slept too long 
Wake up Irene it's time to move along
Wake up Irene and pay for your bed 
Wake up Irene or folks will think your dead

Lot's of guitar pickers by the dozen 
Sang goodnight Irene all night and day
And even Crosby too with his bobobabobedo 
Tried to get Irene to hit the hay
Well I guess they finally sang her off to slumber
They must have tried a million times or more
But oh my aching back when she finally hit the sack 
Man you ought to hear that woman snore

I slipped around with you and found the kind of love I need
Now on the sly both you and I are deep in love somehow
These things they are we've gone too far to ever turn back now

We've gone too far to tell our hearts that our love was reckless fun
If we'd made a bad mistake I'm not sorry it was done
Though you belong to someone else and another has you now
Yet here we are we've gone too far to ever turn back now

We've gone too far when I can't sleep because I always think of you

[B7th] But when I got close, this gal arose, this is what she said to
[E7th] me
Now she said [A] whoa sailor be [D] careful what you do
In your eye there's a gleam and to me it seems your [A] just like all
the [F#] rest
With a [B7th] wolfish eye and a line that's sly, then a [E7th] salior's
at his [A] best.

[A] Now look here babe you've got me wrong , I'm not that sort of [E7th]
guy
[B7th] I just got back from across the sea where there are no gals

[A] Now let me talk to you a while I'm sure you'll see my [E7th] way
[B7th] When I went to spout she turned about this is what she had to
[E7th] say
Now she said[A]  whoa sailor I've [D] heard that line before
You'll look into my eyes and tell me lies and [A] tales of the seven

Well she was right neat and she sure was sweet but I knew she was that

Hank Thompson,"You told her lies as her starry eyes
Looked up in admiration
You painted schemes and lovely dreams
With all your temptation

You spoke of things like wedding rings
And promised her the world
For no cause at all you let her fall
And now she's yesterday's girl

You think it's smart to lure the heart
Of a girl whose lips you kissed
Is it just a game to add her name
To your broken-hearted list?

You've loved some long
You've loved some wrong
You promised each the world
Each game to be just a memory
And another yesterday's girl

Don't you sometimes feel that love
Is real the greatest thing in life?
Not one romance you gave the chance
To be your cherished wife

You cheat and lie you make them cry
And promise each the world
And one by one they each
Become another yesterday's girl

When autumn falls and you recall
The things that might have been
Then you'll pause and see your cause
The greed that's deep within

When you're old and love grows cold
I'll bet you'd give the world
To just relive and take and give
The love of a yesterday's girl",Yesterday's Girl,1989

 They taught me how to write 
 To take the chalk and make a mark 
 And hope it turns out right

 And what you did to me 
 I wrote it so you'd know 
 That I was yours eternally 
 
(Chorus) 
 But my tears have washed I love you 
 From the blackboard of my heart 
 It's too late to clean the slate 
 And make another start 
 I'm satisfied the way things are 
 Although we're far apart 
 My tears have washed I love you from 
 The blackboard of my heart 
 If you'd been true the way you should 
 And not have gone astray 
 These tears would not have fallen down 
 And washed the words away 
 No need to talk, 'cause if the chalk 
 Should write those words again It will be for someone else 
 Not things that might have been

I didn't know God made Honky Tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

The glamor of the gay nightlife has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know know

When I sign the papers that will set you free

I'll tell my friends I'm glad that it's all over
But when I do I'll wipe the tears away
You'll smile and take the hand of your new lover
After tomorrow when I sign my heart away

I'll take the blame, give back your name you wanted
He's done you wrong, I'll hear the lawyers say
But they'll never know how I'll be haunted

But I've had to give you up to make you happy
To give you up was the hardest most of all

With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
I don't understand your feelings but emotions are strange things
Why you gave up the life your leading and gave up your wedding ring
You flaunt your charms and beauty and toss your pretty curls

Hank Thompson,"She lives her life in honky tonks and crowded backstreet bars
A world of make believe that knows no sun or moon or stars
Just a glitter of the great white way and the glare of city lights
Where music's loud she's in the crowd, a girl in the night

I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't last
I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the past
Perhaps there is a story of a love that wasn't right
Now shadows hide her empty pride, a girl in the night

She's sitting there so lonely as she lights a cigarette
The smoke rings rise and in her eyes there seems to be regret
Is she there to tempt the lover in a dress that hugs her tight?
A glass of wine to pass the time, a girl in the night

I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't last
I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the past

Hank Thompson,"When your lover cries hold her close and whisper low
That tears are only rain to make love grow
Kiss her tenderly tell her that you love her so
For tears are only rain to make love grow
Anyone can plant a seed but everybody knows
It needs both sun and rain before it blooms into a rose
When your lover cries hold her close and whisper low
That tears are only rain to make love grow
(Tears are only rain to make love grow)
When your lover smiles let her set your heart aglow
But don't forsake her when she's feeling low
Hold her to your heart dry her eyes and let her know
That tears are only rain to make love grow
She may smile because she knows your love is deep and true
But when she sheds a tears it may be cause of you
When your lover cries tell her that you love her so

He left me when you were a child but he was all this world to me

An old man sat across from me and this is what I saw
From out his sleeve he pulled the card and I pulled out my gun
I shot him dead not knowing then what evil I had done

To build my mansions in the clouds then seen them fall like rain

But if I had it to do over I'd do it again

Now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now

And he wanted to stay in the country said he wanted to stop for his health

One night as I came from my workshop I was whistling and singing with joy
I expected a kind hearty welcome from my sweet loving wife and my boy
But what did I find but a letter it was placed in my room on the stand
And the moment my eyes fell upon it I picked it right up in my hand

Now this note said my wife and the stranger had left and had taken my son
Oh I wonder if God up in heaven only knows what this stranger has done

If I had only known your love was just a loan
For now you're asking me to set you free

I never thought your kisses were like a charge you count
That I'd have to pay in heartaches for taking my amount
I'll give you back your love that I've had all these years
But I'm paying off the interest with my tears

It's the expiration date, you say there's no rebate

When their glamor starts to bore you come on back where you belong
When you've learned these things are true I'll be waiting here for you

I don't know what changed your notion what makes you do things like you do
You told me that there was no other but those words have proven untrue
There's no use to help me further I'm lost like a cloud in the blue

Like a wave that rise on the seashore for something that never can reach

That's how you discarded devotion just like a stone in the sea",Rock in the Ocean,1996

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of the flowing mountains to the southbells by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle to the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're travelin' through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say
Now there's a gal from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And long to be remembered round the ports of Alabam
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Hank Thompson,"Every evening when the sun goes down I sit here in my room
And the lamplight streaming over me projects my lonely gloom
My counterpart in agony mocks each tear that falls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

He's always by my side at night no matter where I go
He lurks out in the darkness or in the neon's glow
He follows me across the steps and up and down the hall
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

I sit and watch the candle and the flicker of the flame
My writhing shadow twists and turns as though it is in pain
I'm trying to escape the memory my mind recalls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

The image of a love I lost and all the things I'd planned
Are as empty as this bottle that I hold in my hand
My soul is buried in the depths of love and life's pitfalls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls",I Cast a Lonesome Shadow,1996
Hank Thompson,"SWING WIDE YOUR GATE OF LOVE
Writers Hank Thompson, S. Nathan

Swing wide your gate of love, open wide up your heart
I knew when I first met you that you'd be my sweetheart
Swing wide your gate of love and please don't let me fall
I know you're gonna love me after all
(Chorus)
Swing wide the gate and leave it open
Towards the center of your heart I'll be bound
And I'll mend the heart that has been broken
I'm not the kind of guy to let you down
So, swing wide your gate of love, open it for me
For you are the one I want, my darlin', can't you see
Make up your mind to like me and to be my turtledove
I love you, so swing wide your gate of love
(Repeat chorus)
(Repeat last verse)



",Swing Wide Your Gate of Love,1996
Hank Thompson,"Every room seems empty now since she's gone away
The music of her laughter is a thing of yesterday
The patter of her footsteps when she'd meet me at the door
The smiling face I loved to see is gone forever more

I see a cozy love seat when we used to sit and talk
My tears fall on the carper where my sweet baby used to walk

A dozen other women I might get to take her place
But none to touch her sweetness, none would have her grace
When her footsteps pleaded from me, it cut me like a sword
A goodbye told me, she was gone, my baby I adore

I see a cozy love seat when we used to sit and talk
My tears fall on the carper where my sweet baby used to walk

",This Train,1996
Hank Thompson,"Now I was down upon my luck
And the jobs were hard to find
I was sort of short on cash
And my bills were way behind

So I went to see my life long friend
An old man now by trade
I figured it's how he had help me out
With his fortune he had made

I said, 'Old pal, I need your help
I hate to be so bold
But remember when I saved your life
Down at the swimming hole'

Now I'd like to ask a favor
If you can see your way
I'd like to have a little loan?
And then I heard him say

Excuse me total stranger
I can't seem to recall
Are you absolutely certain
That we've ever met at all?

""I'd really like to help you out?
As he opened wide the door
So long total stranger
That I've never seen before?

Now once I had a girlfriend
Who really caught my eye
And when the wife was out of town
Well, I'd court her on the sly

We'd taken all the nightclubs
And honky tonk around
Join at all the parties
And really do the town

But then one night my wife came home
She must have smelled a rat
She looked around from place to place
And found where I was at

Well, there we were all cuddled up
I knew that I was dead
But before my wife could say a word
I jumped right up and said

She's just a total stranger
Who came in off the streets
The place is kinda crowded
So I offered her a seat""

""Now, I couldn't leave this lady
Just a standin' on the floor
She's just a total stranger
That I've never seen before?

My friend said let's go huntin'
I've got the gun and chills
The birds are really flyin'
And I think we'll do quite well

He killed a half a dozen
Then said, I supposed
I really ought to tell you
That the huntin' season's closed?

About that time he heard a noise
And he ducked behind a tree
He took the gun, shelled some birds
And gave them all to me

Up stepped the old game warden
And found me standing there
Before I had a chance to talk
I heard my friend declare

He's just a total stranger
And I was passing by
I saw this total stranger
Shoot those birds out of the sky?

It's a shame the way some people
The laws they do ignore
Like this total stranger
That I've never seen before?",Total Stranger,1996
Hank Thompson,"Please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin

Hank Thompson,"Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you

Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with you",I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love With You),1997
Hank Thompson,"Just a rolling stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy down the lost highway

I was just a lad nearly twenty two
Not bad not good just a kid like you
But now I'm lost too late to pray
Lord I'm rolling down that lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh the day we met I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

Now boys don't start to rambling round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you curse the day
You started rolling down that lost highway",Lost Highway,1997
Hank Thompson,"There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight 
I looked out the window and over the gate 
The big, fat rabbits are a-jumpin' in the grass 
Wait'll they hear my old shotgun blast 

Shotgun Boogie, I done saw your tracks 
Look out Mr. Rabbit when I cock my hammer back 
Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark 

Hick'ry nuts so big you can see 'em in the dark 
The big fat squirrels they scratch and they bite 
I'll be on that ridge before daylight 

Shotgun Boogie, all I need is one shot 
Look out bushy tail, tonight you'll be in the pot 
Well, I met a pretty gal, she was tall and thin 
I asked her what she had, she said, ""A Fox Four-Ten"" 
I looked her up and down and said, ""Boy, this is love"" 
So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove 

Shotgun Boogie, boy the feathers flew 
Look out Mister Dove when she draws a bead on you 
I sat down on a log, took her on my lap 
She said, ""Wait a minute, bub, you got to see my Pap 
He's got a sixteen-gauge choked down like a rifle 
He don't like a man that's a-gonna trifle"" 

Shotgun Boogie, draws a bead so fine 
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time 
Well, I called on her Pap like a gentleman oughta 
He said, ""No brush hunter's gonna get my daughter"" 

He cocked back the hammer right on the spot

Hank Thompson,"I'll tell you 'bout my night on shore if you will lend an ear
I stepped into a cabaret to get myself a beer
A pretty girl sat all alone and needed company
But when I got close, this girl a rose this is what she said to me

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, be careful what you do
In your eye there's a gleam
And to me it seems you're just like all the rest
With a wolfish eye and a line that's sly than a sailor's at his best""

""Now look here, babe, you've got me wrong, I'm not that kinda guy
I just got back from across the seas where there are no gals arie
Now let me talk to you a while, I'm sure you'll see my way""
But when I went to spout she turned about this is what she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I've heard that line before
You'll look into my eyes
And tell me lies and tales of the seven seas
But a sailor's full of that kinda bull so don't hand it to me

""Oh pretty girl, you've let me down, you've broken my poor heart
And oh, how it hurt when you had to spurt that last sad remark""
I said, ""I think I'll have a drink and I broke out six month's pay""
With a wide open eyes she breathed a sigh this time she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I think you've won my heart""
Well, she was right neat and she sure was sweet
But I knew she was that sort but she's not all to blame

Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonely I wonder why mommy don't come
She told me to close my pretty blue eyes and when I awoke she'd be home
I guess I'll go down and find daddy I think he went down to the store
That big long room filled with bottles I wish that he'd go there no more
Sometimes he's so sick when he come from he staggers and falls on the ground
One night when came in the parlor he kicked my poor dolly around
But I love him and I guess I'll go find him I know he would gladly come home
Then it won't be so dark and so lonesome while waiting for money to come
His red eyes gazed wild when she found him her sweet smiling face was still fair
But too late the demon possessed him for he grabbed at the back of a chair
In a moment the whole thing was over the work of the beast was complete
And a poor little innocent blossom lay dying at her daddy's knees

Hank Thompson,"Silver coins that jingle jangle fancy shoes that dance in time
Oh the secrets of her dark eyes they did sing a gypsy rhyme
Yellow clover in tangled blossoms in a meadow silky green
Where she held me to her bosom just a boy of seventeen
I recall a gypsy woman silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight and the taste of life's sweet wine
Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows stir the darkness in my mind
Oh gentle woman you sleep beside me and little know who haunts my mind
Gypsy lady I hear your laughter and it dances in my head
While my tender wife and babies slumber softly in their bed
I recall a gypsy woman",I Recall a Gypsy Woman,2000

(Jimmie Rodgers)
Â« Â© '28 Peer International Â»

I had a friend named Rambling Bob who used to steal gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday that Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way downtown
He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
He played the game called poker he knocked all with an yoker
But shootin' dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail nobody's to go his bail
The judge done said that he'll refuse to find
He's in the jailhouse now...
Now I went out last Tuesday met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money and she started to callin' me honey
We took in every cabaret in town
We're in the jailhouse now we're in the jailhouse now
I've told the judge right to his face we didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

With a long soft southern drawl said I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool
A barroom girl with wise and knowing eyes slowly looked me up and down
And she said I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town
And she said hello country bumpkin
How's the frost out on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights but man you're somethin'
Where'd you come from country bumpkin
Just a short year later in a bed of joy filled tears and death like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders another wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and tenderness 
As I marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast
And she said hello country bumpkin
Fresh as frost out on the pumpkins
I've seen some sights but babe you're somethin'
Mommy loves her country bumpkin
Forty years of hard work later in a simple quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from my woman's face
She was lying on her death bed knowing fully well her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son

I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured big champagne by candle light
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life

A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said, ""I'll take two bottles of your best""

He winkled as if to say you know the rest

I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life

I drove around the block till I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in

Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty 
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Skid Row Joe last night that's who I found in the dirty part of town
Lost forgotten with no place to go
Tormented with a bitter taste outcast by the human race
A mask of torture was the face of Skid Row Joe
He walked up to where I stood on the street
Said pardon me Mister now don't get me wrong I don't want your money
Though heaven knows I could use it
But you see this is my home and you see the other bar down the street
Well that's my home too
I noticed you starin' at me a while ago you recognized me didn't you
I said yeah Joe I know who you are
You was one time a real famous singing star one of my favorites
He said well I guess you heard they took my babies away from me
I said yeah Joe I read about it in the papers
Then he turned his head away and I saw the tears fall in the place
And he turned to me and he said you know Mister
This is the only place in the world that I'm not ashamed to show my face
But I'm gonna quit yes sir I'm gonna quit
And I'm gonna cut my hair and shave and get me a clean white shirt
Then I'm gonna walk up to her door
When she answers I'm gonna stand up real proud and tall
Then I'm gonna get on my knees
Then I'll say sweetheart if you'll take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life makin' up to you for what I've done
I'm so ashamed of myself and this I want you to know
Then I'm gonna take my two little babies and I'm gonna hold 'em so close to me
I ain't gonna never let 'em go

And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the Amen Corner of that church sat Brother Ira
And he insisted every Sunday on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he'd get behind and miss the words
Well at last the storm cloud burst and the church was told in vine
That Brother Ira must stop his singing or the choir was gonna resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
And they got their big fine car and drove up to Ira's door
They found the choir's great trouble sittin' in an old arm chair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow white hair
Said York we're here dear Brother with the best res approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now it was our understanding when we bargained for the chair
That they were to relieve us that is they'd do the singin' for us
Now we don't want no singin' except what we've bought
The newest tunes are all the rage the old ones stand for nought
And so we have decided are you listenin' Brother Ira
You'll have to stop your singin' it's messin' up our choir
The old man raised his head a sign that he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I've sung the songs of David nearly eighty years said he
They've been my staff and comfort all along life's dreary way
I'm sorry if I disturbed the choir I guess I'm doin' wrong
But when my heart is filled with praise I can't hold back a song
I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
Yes I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
I wonder if they'll kick me out up there for singin' in Heaven's choir
A silence filled the little room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ira was dead
Oh the choir missed him for a while but he was soon forgot

Many times I tried, you wouldn't let me come inside
Now I'm waiting, waiting in the lobby of your heart

You could have had me thrown into a prison
Or bound and tied with shackles on my feet
Instead of this sad taint to sit alone and wait
In the lobby of a heart that's cold as sleet

Hank Thompson & His Brazos Valley Boys,"For months and months and months around the country
Everybody sang Irene goodnight
But she wouldn't go to bed no matter what they said
Though everybody tried with all their might

She stayed awake while steel guitars were a going
In every honky tonk she could be seen
But she finally went to bed and covered up her head
And now there's not a thing can wake Irene

Wake up Irene, you've sleep too long
Wake up Irene, it's time to move along
Wake up Irene, and pay for your bed
Wake up Irene or folks will think you're dead

Lot's of guitar pickers by the dozen
Sang 'Goodnight Irene' all night and day
And even Crosby too with his bo bo bo bo be do
Tried to get Irene to hit the hay

Well I guess they finally sang her off to slumber
They must have tried a million times or more
But, oh, my aching back when she finally hit the sack man
You ought to hear that women snore

Hank Thompson & His Brazos Valley Boys,"I'll tell you 'bout my night on shore if you will lend an ear
I stepped into a cabaret to get myself a beer
A pretty girl sat all alone and needed company
But when I got close, this girl a rose this is what she said to me

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, be careful what you do
In your eye there's a gleam
And to me it seems you're just like all the rest
With a wolfish eye and a line that's sly than a sailor's at his best""

""Now look here, babe, you've got me wrong, I'm not that kinda guy
I just got back from across the seas where there are no gals arie
Now let me talk to you a while, I'm sure you'll see my way""
But when I went to spout she turned about this is what she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I've heard that line before
You'll look into my eyes
And tell me lies and tales of the seven seas
But a sailor's full of that kinda bull so don't hand it to me

""Oh pretty girl, you've let me down, you've broken my poor heart
And oh, how it hurt when you had to spurt that last sad remark""
I said, ""I think I'll have a drink and I broke out six month's pay""
With a wide open eyes she breathed a sigh this time she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I think you've won my heart""

But I knew she was that sort but she's not all to blame

So I strolled out on the sidewalk began to look around
Looking everywhere for my baby but that sweet woman can't be found
It was down at St James infirmary I found my baby there
Stretched out on a long white table so cold so pale so fair
So I strolled back down to the barroom to get another drink of gin
The next thing you know I'm reeling rocking and drunk again
Sixteen coal black horses all hitched up in a line

Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonely I wonder why mommy don't come
She told me to close my pretty blue eyes and when I awoke she'd be home
I guess I'll go down and find daddy I think he went down to the store
That big long room filled with bottles I wish that he'd go there no more
Sometimes he's so sick when he come from he staggers and falls on the ground
One night when came in the parlor he kicked my poor dolly around
But I love him and I guess I'll go find him I know he would gladly come home
Then it won't be so dark and so lonesome while waiting for money to come
His red eyes gazed wild when she found him her sweet smiling face was still fair
But too late the demon possessed him for he grabbed at the back of a chair
In a moment the whole thing was over the work of the beast was complete
And a poor little innocent blossom lay dying at her daddy's knees

Hank Thompson & His Brazos Valley Boys,"STEEL GUITAR RAG
Writer Leon McAuliffe

Been runnin' around, seen many a town, and maybe you'll find I'm the kind of guy that brags. But listen to me and see if you don't agree No melody rolls like that old steel guitar rag And when they slide that thing, along those strings It sounds so doggone heavenly, you can hear the Angels sing And when you stomp your feet, your heart will beat, A rhythm to the old steel guitar rag Break or bridge: You may be kind choosy, 'bout the kind of songs you hear, You maybe like them blusey, makes you cry right in your beer, But if you want a song that's bound to dry away your tears, Make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag.

Hank Thompson & His Brazos Valley Boys,"I didn't have to open up the bottle to pour out the glass of cherry wine
After all the things you've said if I want to look at red
I look at this broken heart of mine
You broke my heart and left it slowly pleading
A crimson stream is red as cherry wine
It could have been as sweet but you tossed it at your feet
Take a look at this broken heart of mine
[ fiddle ]
It's a mangled mess of many mornful moments
A symbol of a love that was so blind
It shows that when there's hate it can't be to reate
Take a look at this broken heart of mine
You leered at love then laughed and left it lying
To wither like a grape upon the vine
Like a garden choked with weeds like the flowers turned to seeds
Take a look at this broken heart of mine

The jukebox will be playing your favorite song tonight
You're the loneliest fool that's living in your make believe world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
Though you chose the life that lead you to sorrow and shame
Each shoulder that you cry on, you swear that I'm to blame
You gave up the one that loved you to live in your sorted world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
You can't say I didn't love you as you're crying in your beer
You drink to every heartache and wish that I was near
With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
I don't understand your feelings but emotions are strange things
Why you gave up the life your leading and gave up your wedding ring
You flaunt your charms and beauty and toss your pretty curls

Hank Thompson & His Brazos Valley Boys,"When I was young and went to school 
 They taught me how to write 
 To take the chalk and make a mark 
 And hope it turns out right 
 Well that's the way it is with love 
 And what you did to me 
 I wrote it so you'd know 
 That I was yours eternally 
 
(Chorus) 
 But my tears have washed I love you 
 From the blackboard of my heart 
 It's too late to clean the slate 
 And make another start 
 I'm satisfied the way things are 
 Although we're far apart 
 My tears have washed I love you from 
 The blackboard of my heart 
 If you'd been true the way you should 
 And not have gone astray 
 These tears would not have fallen down 
 And washed the words away 
 No need to talk, 'cause if the chalk 
 Should write those words again It will be for someone else 
 Not things that might have been

In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned
Many a lesson I have learned
Yet I feel like in those hills, I still belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born

But as I sit here today
Many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

That tears are only rain to make love grow
Kiss her tenderly tell her that you love her so
For tears are only rain to make love grow
Anyone can plant a seed but everybody knows
It needs both sun and rain before it blooms into a rose
When your lover cries hold her close and whisper low
That tears are only rain to make love grow
(Tears are only rain to make love grow)
When your lover smiles let her set your heart aglow
But don't forsake her when she's feeling low
Hold her to your heart dry her eyes and let her know
That tears are only rain to make love grow

Hank Thompson & His Brazos Valley Boys,"You told her lies as her starry eyes
Looked up in admiration
You painted schemes and lovely dreams
With all your temptation

You spoke of things like wedding rings
And promised her the world
For no cause at all you let her fall
And now she's yesterday's girl

You think it's smart to lure the heart
Of a girl whose lips you kissed
Is it just a game to add her name
To your broken-hearted list?

You've loved some long
You've loved some wrong
You promised each the world
Each game to be just a memory
And another yesterday's girl

Don't you sometimes feel that love
Is real the greatest thing in life?
Not one romance you gave the chance
To be your cherished wife

You cheat and lie you make them cry
And promise each the world
And one by one they each
Become another yesterday's girl

When autumn falls and you recall
The things that might have been
Then you'll pause and see your cause
The greed that's deep within

When you're old and love grows cold
I'll bet you'd give the world
To just relive and take and give

You can try to lock up the truth but the door won't shut
'Cause the truth just keeps comin' out like blood from a cut

But I can still read you just like a magazine
And I ain't gonna drink no more till the water runs clean

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me

You got me chasin' rabbits, walkin' on my hands and howlin' at the moon

Well sug', I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
Now I can't tell the day from night, I'm crazy as a loon
You got me chasin' rabbits, pullin' out my hair and howlin' at the moon

Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree
'Cause there ain't a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me
I eat three bones for dinner today, then tried to tree a 'coon
You got me chasin' rabbits, scratchin' fleas and howlin' at the moon

I rode my horse to town today and a gas pump we did pass
I pulled 'im up and I a-hollered whoa, said fill 'im up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham, he changed my tune
You got me chasin' rabbits, spittin' out teeth and howlin' at the moon

I never thought in this old world, a fool could fall so hard
But honey baby, when I fell the whole world must have jarred
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if you'd take me for your groom
You got me chasin' rabbits, pickin' out rings and howlin' at the moon",Howlin' at the Moon,

Hank Williams,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian, standin' by the door
He fell in love with an indian maid, over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Just stood there, and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

He always wore his Sunday feathers, and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh
To stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart is made of knotty pine

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?

Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Chocktaw maid with the coal-black hair
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh-so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed

Hang the scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion
And there's pictures of keys and of strife

There hung pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old age and a blushing young bride
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all
Are the pictures from life's other side

Just a picture from life's other side

A life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day

She's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side

Who had lost all of his money at play
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day

It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side

Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heartbroken mother and baby
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an outcast, soon no one will save

And yet she was once a true woman

On The [E7] Banks Of The Old Ponchar-[A] train.

The fairest young maiden that I ever saw
Passed by as it started to rain
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.

We hid from the shower an hour or so
She asked me how long I'd remain
I told her that I'd spend the rest of my days
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.

I just couldn't tell her that I ran away
From jail on a West Texas plain
I prayed in my heart I would never be found
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.

Then one day a man put his hand on my arm
And said I must go west again
I left her alone without saying goodbye
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do

At home alone I hang my head in sorrow

There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice

I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth

Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet.

So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude
On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude
Ah, sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes.

And the last word led to a divorce

Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense

This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider

For wealth and what it will buy

Than to live in this world in a house of gold

I'll carry you to a home on high

Hank Williams,"If you will listen, a song I will sing
About my daddy who drove a log train
Way down in the southland, in old Alabama
We lived in a place that they call Chapmantown

And late in the evening, when the sun was low
Way off in the distance you could hear the train blow
The folks would come runnin', and Moma would say
""Get the supper on the table, here comes the log train""

Every mornin', at the break of day
He'd grab his lunchbucket, and be on his way
Winter or summer, sunshine or rain
Every mornin', he'd run that ole log train

A sweatin' an swearin' all day long
Shoutin', ""Get up there oxen, keep movin' along
Load her up boys, 'cause it looks like rain
I've gotta get rollin', this ole log train""

This story happened, a long time ago
The log train is silent, God called Dad to go
But when I get to Heaven, ta always remain
I'll listen to the whistle of the ole log train

WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, HANK WILLIAMS JR.

You're letter says you're unhappy we're many miles apart
It's a little late to ask for pity,
Remember you broke your own heart
You walked out on the heart that loved you, has no pity from the start
You cheated and lied and now you're gonna cry,
Remember you broke your own heart
A heart can stand so much sorrow and then it bends and breaks
And a love that is honest and true can turn to bitter hate
Now that you're gone and lonely, and your dreams have fallen apart
Think of the one that once loved you,
Remember you broke your own heart

She knows not to speak to me or my child my neighbor then smiled and I thought

Hank Williams,"Passing by a lonesome graveyard
Everything I love is gone
Weeping as they lay my darling
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

In this world I'm left to wander
With no one to call my own
While my precious darling's sleeping
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Out there in that lonesome graveyard
She is sleeping all alone
And I buried my heart with her
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Skies above are dark and stormy
All the sunshine, all is gone
For the while my love is sleeping
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

My heart is dead and yet i`m living
Traveling through this world alone
I wish that I was with my darling

I'm gonna praise my blessed Saviour's name

To travel a land of hunger and pain

So try to repent and ask for forgiveness
We'll meet up in heaven, someday.

Hank Williams,"Words and music by Hank Williams, Sr.
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now has withered and gone.

The roses have faded, there`s frost at my door
The birds in the morning don`t sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry.

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand.

Oh, where has she gone to, oh, where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away.

The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to ""Bay""
I wonder, I wonder, what she`s thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten, without any love.

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand.",Alone and Forsaken,1989

An old man sat in his little cabin door
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
A jolly old tune that he played by ear.

It was raining hard but the fiddler didn't care
He sawed away at the popular air
Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
That didn't seem to bother the old man at all.

A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn't seem to fret.

So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
You'd better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn't mend it now it's a rainy day.

The traveler replied that's all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.

And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
Get along said he for you give me a pain

With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat. 
For souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts, 
For a living death is all that's left for men with brokens hearts. 
You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn. 
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him. 
One careless step, a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts 
And to those who weep death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts. 

Humble you should be when they come passing by, 
For its written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry. 
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts, 
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts. 
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes, 
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies. 

Some were porpers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts, 
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts. 
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death. 
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath? 
So help your brother along the road, no matter where he starts! 
For the God that made you,made them too. These men with broken hearts!",Men with Broken Hearts,1996

He held and caressed it - and gazed up above

I'll bring you, your dolly - at the first fall of snow

And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say

My wife's been sick, the young ones, too
And I'm darn near down with the flu
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The bees got mad and they left the hive
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The porch rotted down that's more expense
The darned old mule he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and I can't pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

My land's so poor so hard and yeller
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller
And it rains out here nearly every day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The house it leaks it needs a new top
When it rains it wets everything we got
The chimney fell down just yesterday
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The corn meals gone and the meat's run out
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke
And all we got left is one old Billy goat
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

When flowers are bloomin' beneath the moon

Hank Williams,"I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Just a little old shanty by a railroad track,
The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby,
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry.

I've got the freight train blues, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes,
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go, 
Oh! Lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose,
The mean old freight train blues.

Now my Pappy was a fireman and my Mammy dear,
Was the only daughter of an en-gin- eer,
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.

Hank Williams,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew

Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips

Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race

And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above

The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan

Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground

And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long

And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray

Homes of beauty and wealth
But what of a home in heaven
Where will you live after death

Are you building a home in heaven

To that beautiful home up there
Is work on your home completed

How can you turn away from his side,
With tears in his eyes, on the cross there he died,
How can you're fuse Jesus now.

Of how our savior died, as they nailed his hands,
He cried they don't under stand,
As the blood flowed from his side.

Hank Williams,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true
I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night

She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key

For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight

She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then

And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went to sleep

So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no."" 

Poor ol' Kaw-liga, he never got a kiss.
Poor ol' Kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed. 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-liga, that poor ol' wooden head. 

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk. 
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped some day he'd talk.
Kaw-liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign, 
Because his heart was made of knotty pine. 

Kaw-liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere. 
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair.
Kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show, 
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no."" 

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid, 
And took her, oh, so far away, but ol' Kaw-liga stayed. 
Kaw-liga just stands there as lonely as can be, 
And wishes he was still an old pine tree.",Kaw-Liga [Demo With Two False Starts][#],1998
Hank Williams,"Last night I dreamed of Heaven and I saw my mother there
Standing with all the angels on a golden stair
I thought I heard her whisper welcome home my boy
Last night I dreamed of Heaven and it filled my heart with joy

I heard the angels singing songs of peace and rest
And then there was a silence, each eye looked toward the west
There sat my Saviour on His golden throne
Last night I dreamed of Heaven, my eternal home sweet home

Last night I dreamed of Heaven that land so pure and sweet
And the joy within me made my glad heart weep
I was there with my Saviour free from grief and strife
Last night I dreamed of Heaven, the land of eternal life

Locked me to a ball and chain

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

When the evenin' train goes by

Till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow

Hank Williams,"(e) I was strollin' one day, in a lonely graveyard,
When a voice from the tomb, seemed to (b7) say,
I once (e) lived as you live, walked and talked as you talk,
But from earth I was (b7) soon called a- (e) way.

Chorus

(e) oh, those tombs, (""oh those tombs""),
Lonely tombs, (""lonely tombs ""),
Seemed to say in a low gentle (b7) tone,
Oh how (e) sweet, (""oh how sweet""),
Is the rest, (""is the rest""),
In our beautiful, (b7) heavenly (e) home.

Every voice from the tomb, seemed to whisper and say,
Livin' man you must soon follow me,
And I thought as I gazed, on that cold marble slab,
What a sad lonesome place that must be.

Repeat chorus

I then came to the place, where my mother did lay,
And her voice, soft and low, from the tomb,
It said, son I'm at rest, with the savior above,
I am safe in my heavenly home.

You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted towards Heaven

Hank Williams,"What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
Oh, what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge;
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Do the friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee;
And you will find a solace there.

Hank Williams,"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures
Hang the scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion
And there's pictures of keys and of strife

There hung pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old age and a blushing young bride
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all
Are the pictures from life's other side

Just a picture from life's other side
Someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day

There's a poor old mother at home
She's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side

The first scene is that of a gambler
Who had lost all of his money at play
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day

It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side

Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heartbroken mother and baby
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an outcast, soon no one will save

And yet she was once a true woman
She was somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep
It's just a picture from life's other side

In an arbor by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors
Brush arbors by the side of the road

In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me

Through valleys, o'er mountains and plains
Both footsore and weary, I rested awhile
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

The fairest young maiden that I ever saw
Passed by as it started to rain
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

We hid from the shower, an hour or so
She asked me, how long I'd remain?
I told her that I'd spend the rest of my days
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

I just couldn't tell her that I ran away
From jail on a West Texas plane
I prayed in my heart, I would never be found
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

Then one day a man put his hand on my arm
And said I must go west again
I left her alone without saying goodbye
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain

I know that she's waiting in vain
I'm hoping and praying someday to return

A sergeant commanded the boys in church.

After the Chaplain read the prayer, the text was taken up next. 
Those of the boys that had a prayer book took them out. 
One boy had only a deck of cards, and he spread them out.

After the service was over, 
The soldier was taken prisoner 
And brought before the Provost Marshall.

""For playing cards in church, Sir,"" was the response.

I have been on the march for about six months. 
I have neither bible nor a prayer book, 
But I hope to satisfy you, sir, with the purity of my intentions."" 
And with that, the boy started his story 

""You see, sir, when I look at the Ace, 
It reminds me that there is but one God.
And the deuce reminds me that the bible is divided into two parts: 
The Old and the New Testaments.
When I see the trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
And when I see the four, I think of the four evangelists 
Who preached the Gospel: there was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
And when I see the five, 
It reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; 
There were ten of them: 
Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out.
When I see the six, 
It reminds me that in six days God made this heaven and earth.
And when I see the seven, 
It reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from his great work.
And when I see the eight, 
I think of the eight righteous persons that 
God saved when he destroyed the earth: 
There was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives.
And when I see the nine, 
I think of the lepers our saviour cleansed, 
And that nine of the ten didn't even thank him.
When I see the ten, I think of the ten commandments 
That God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone.
When I see the King, 
It reminds me that there is 
But one King of Heaven, God Almighty.
And when I see the Queen, 
I think of the blessed Virgin Mary who is the Queen of Heaven.
And the Jack or Knave is the Devil.

When I count the number of spots in a deck of cards, 
I find 365, the number of days in a year.
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year.
There are four suits, the number of weeks in a month.
There are twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year.
There are thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.

So you see, Sir, 
My deck of cards serves me as a bible, 
An almanac and a prayer book.""

Hank Williams,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
She never close her eyes to sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept and when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three

It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key
For always when we'd step inside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why

Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
She had to know we were safe before she went to rest 

For she seemed to fear the world might harm the ones 
She loved best and once she said when you have grown into woman and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care

That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called to gather roun her bed
The children're all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
That told she'd been waitin just to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years tand 

Then she went to sleep

That the old-time religion was real
I said ""I'll go down, take a look at the crowd
For just that weak-minded I feel.""

I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door

And I'll set as far back as I can."" (but-)

I said, ""it's commotion, that's all.""
""when they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave
For I don't wanta be seen here at all.""

But I bowed that time, he got started to preach
And he looked straight down at me
He told ev'rybody how mean that I was
He didn't talk like he thought much of me.

I sat in my seat just thinkin' it o'er

From the Bible it came
And it tells us how Judas 
Sold the Savior in shame
He planned with the council 
Of high priest that day
30 pieces of silver 
Was the price they would pay

30 pieces of silver 
30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus 
On the cross he was slain
Betrayed and forsaken 
Unloved and unclaimed 
In anger they pierced him
But he died not in VAIN
Twas on there on the hillside 
The multitude came 
And found our dear Savior
Then took him away
They bruised Him and mocked Him 
Thorns were crowned around his head
And his garment of purple 
Showed the blood stains of red

Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun 
Judas begged mercy for what he had done 
He gave back the silver 
For his heart filled with strife
Then there in the mountain he took his own life

Was the price paid for Jesus

I'll get along without you now, that's plain to see

It was just a year ago when I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you'd love me, too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Cause he's a bulky stubborn fool

An when his tail begins to swish
That mule ain't bothered with an itch...fly trouble

Now you pick a perfect night in June
When flowers are bloomin' beneath the moon 
And ya light of love is shinin' bright 
An you tell ya self tonight's the night

Ya brace ya self an ya courage grows
An on ya knees where you would propose

You're just in time to be too late and I won't be home no more

Hank Williams III,"Now, you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kinda mad
I had a lot a luck but it's all been bad
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

My fishin' pole's broke, the creek is full of sand
My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

My distant uncle passed away
And left me quite a batch
And I was livin' high until the fatal day
A lawyer proved I wasn't born, I was only hatched

Everything's agin me and it's got me down
If I jumped in the river I would probably drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time
Is full of holes and nails
And brother, if I stepped on worn-out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails

I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
'Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright no-how
No matter how I struggle and strive

Hank Williams III,"All you want to do is sit around and pout
And now I got enough and so I'm getting out
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I been in the doghouse so doggone long
That when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go get yourself a man that wants to fight
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

You start your jaws a-wagging and it never stops
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I remember back when you were nice and sweet
Things have changed, you'd rather fight than eat
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'm a-gonna do some riding on the midnight train
I'm taking everything except my ball and chain

Hank Williams III,"You'll meet many just like me upon lifes busy street. 
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat. 
For souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts, 
For a living death is all that's left for men with brokens hearts. 
You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn. 
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him. 
One careless step, a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts 
And to those who weep death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts. 

Humble you should be when they come passing by, 
For its written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry. 
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts, 
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts. 
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes, 
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies. 

Some were porpers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts, 
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts. 
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death. 
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath? 
So help your brother along the road, no matter where he starts! 
For the God that made you,made them too. These men with broken hearts!",Men with Broken Hearts,1996

You gotta treat her nice and kind

Hank Williams III,"Well, I caught you with him
On those damp satin sheets,
So I packed my things 
And then I hit the streets

87 southbound 
To San Antone
It's getting late out, 
I ain't got no home

The pavements burning 
At ninety-two
I don't need to hear no more excuses
That I don't love you

Lord, the sun keeps beating me down 
And it's hotter than hell
And if I'm lucky I'll catch a ride,
But you can never tell

I'd rather be here with the bugs and flies 
Than back there hearing your alibis
Heard all that I'm gonna hear you say, 
I'm gonna take my pride and go the other way

87 southbound 
To San Antone
It's getting late out,
I'm 40 miles from home

The rain keeps falling 
Like the tears in my eyes, 
I'm just trying to wash away 
The hurt from all your lies

Lightning streaks across the evening sky
And if I'm lucky I'll make it big 
Or lay right down and die

I know when the morning comes 
I'm gonna be a walking son of a gun.
When afternoon comes rolling around, 
I'll have ten more miles and one more town

I used to live by the right
But I've strayed from the good side of the lord
And I flirted with the Devil and he dealt me a card

And he told me that you will never win
And he told me that I was his best friend
I had nothing to go home to
So I sold my soul to the Devil now I'm blue

Hank Williams III,"Early one mornin' while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up the next morning and I grabbed my gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Laid in the hot joint, takin' the pill
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said ""Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown""
""You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
Yes, oh yes my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
I had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my doddered carcass in that county jail
The next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff comin' down the line
He kind of coughed as he cleared his throat
He said ""Come on you dirty hack, to the district court""
Entered the courtroom, and my trial began
Where I was held by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that dirty judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read ""In the first degree""
I hollered ""Lordy, Lordy have mercy on me!""
The judge smiled as he picked up his pen
""Ninety-nine years in the Folsom State Pen""
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen up to me
""Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be!""",Cocaine Blues,1999

Well I've got her in my arms

Singing my songs and trying to get paid

Never could respect a sherriff trying to break my neck
With a few friends and a can of mace
Born on the south-side with a lot of rebel pride 
I raised a lot of hell in my younger days

I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it

And I plan on living long

Its a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But that's the kind of life I'm living 
And I plan on living long

Running hard running free never gonna catch me 
Driving too fast on a black top road
Loaded up, hammered back
I'll smack you with my tire jack 
You better walk away before I carry you home
Passing my pig sty, sleeping where the dogs lie 
Anywhere I go is where I call my home
Been stoned, been straight,
Been to hell and heaven.s gate 
I got thrown out 'cause they said I didn't belong

Hey, I just keep movin' on
I could be right I could be wrong
