Ab-Soul,"No chain, tattoos where you can't see
I'm the one, I'm the man that you can't be
Decade and plus in the game, I got a name
While a lot of these commercial ass rappers should be ashamed
Sold your soul for that 15 minutes
You was in, you was on, you was hot, now you finished
I represent the real hip-hop
For my homies that still sell pills and load Glocks
I told them young dudes clean your money up
There's a recession and it's the perfect time for comin up!
You can listen to these rappers if you're dumb enough
Or smile, get money, have fun, be one of us
Why you acting tough for?
Wouldn't throw a cream-puff in a cupcake war
It's not real, it's all what you make it
All you got is your word and you're fucked once you break it

Life is a myth and time is an illusion
I'm a light shining through the confusion
We sell frequencies designed as music
All I do is kick rhymes, have fun, and do cool shit

If it wasn't for this hip-hop ish, I'd probably lose it
The real thinker: don't confuse me with Confucius
Cut on your blinker, get it right, I'm the prototype
I spit like I mix chemicals in beakers
Way before I heard my words thumping out a speaker
I knew I was too cool to play follow the leader
Everything I do goes over the head of overachievers
We can discuss this over lunch, it's over when I dump my thesis
Fuckin' punks, runch of bitches: y'all should wear pumps
Square up, run to Orange County for a ""fair"" one
I'm out your frequency, don't speak to me
Reason be I'm like a deity, I'm the elite
MURS: bow our heads, bon apetit
Let's turn Paid Dues into Coachella and have a feast!
This rap game is full of lames driving themselves insane
Looking for a lane, mayne

Life is a myth and time is an illusion
I'm a light shining through the confusion
We sell frequencies designed as music
All I do is kick rhymes, have fun, and do cool shit

This is grown-man talk
Head up high with pride is how I walk. Take notes from the source
It's ? analog and the 2-inch ?
You had to show and prove the skill to cop you a deal
Co-signs was void, shortcuts didn't exist
You had to go hard in the paint to score
Testing time to separate the weak from those
Who had abilities to transcend beats in other words, yo
You had rappers, and then you had emcees
? Melly Mel G Rap and O.C
Busy B, Starsky, Old Varsity
Sideways talk nowadays: larceny
Fast forward, present time, now it's something called 360 deal
Idiots ask where do I sign?
Bend over! Face down, gettin dick from behind
I'm shaking my head thinking you out your cotton-picking mind!

Life is a myth and time is an illusion
I'm a light shining through the confusion

Ab-Soul,"I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I just went in and stole it, the police would of notice
Gotta be strategic, creepin', go in, leave with that motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, caseing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions
Headed in sweatin', open that front door
Interscope printed out right by the entrance, door closes
Not a metaphor, then I start towards
That front, that’s right, where you check in
Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, why shoot?
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!)
Carrying 2 cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor i’m late, paintin' jimmy iovine's office
Holding my breath ‘bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then i’m leaving town with that contract
And i’m spazzing out, grabbin' the a&r out
His chair and i’m taking him hostage
I don’t give a fuck, step into the elevator press 3
Now i’m headed up (heist!)
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And i’m ready and willing to bust ‘em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink

I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicals
But it’s weird, it’s like this room i’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
Cds boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin’ that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yea, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent
Big block silver letters, read it out loud: president (nice!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said: we’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you’re destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you’re next to be famous
Now i’m sorry, i’ve had a long day remind me, now what your name is?
That’s right, macklemore, of course, today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? we’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out we’ll need back that money that you borrowed
So it’s really like a loan, a loan? come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
We’ll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10
So shit, after taxes you and ryan have 7% to split
That’s not bad, i’ve seen a lot worse, no one will give you a better offer than us (hmm)
I replied I appreciate the offer, thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked",Jimmy Iovine,2012

I'm in Wonderland
Where's the rabbit?
He is late again
Goodness
Gracious
I can't wait for him
Who has got the time?
Round and round and
Round and round we go
It's just like the
Same scenario
Good for nothing
Feels like somethin' ain't right

I might
I might've got way too high
I might've got way too high

I am trippin'
I keep slippin'
I cannot recognize
What's the difference
In pretending and
Living a real lie?
Ha ha ha ha ha
Everything is spinnin now
Ha ha ha ha ha
Have you seen the ground

I might've got way too high
I might've got way too high

Break it down, roll it up
Mountains and valleys
Seashells from Sally
Ego removed but still in tune exactly
Pride to the side
Third eye winking at me
My what a ride
Real trippy shit
I glimpse with a squint
But I can see a whole grip
My retinas red
My vision is crystal
Didn't use pencil
But it's true I led
My way to this sedated state of mind I always dread
My daddy did it
This is the state of mind I always had
I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man
I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams
So I take a deep breath
Puff, puff, pass
Part of my paranoia
I'm just a product of my past
I show you how to let your soul sail
Sparking lala
Talking to Allah

Ab-Soul,"Ever since a nigga had recess
Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno
Damn that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut
On this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sin is a habit
I can't hack fornicate, act as rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high
Still in high school but I do
Everything I will do
When I'm 25, no lie

I was young with ambition
Fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission
Went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition type visions, see the world as it goes
Tell them all what they missing
While I watch as it unfolds
Dodging my death
Confident kid I was trying to grow up with the best
Watching my step
Never know college but could find me nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of those hoes from the Bachelor
Coulda been smart
Coulda been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, like she woulda caughtcha
Almost got her knocked up, woulda been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I got my own business
Then I got fame like what the fuck is this
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool? Cause I got money
Back in high school none of the hoes was tryna fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts are scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit for the parakeets

They, they, they was looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a money heist scheme
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed

If you 18 years and older
18 years and older
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family, and take care of my girl

I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was sick
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was ill
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was I'll be here

I'll be there, everywhere, tell the truth you wouldn't dare
Cross me like the gold you wear
Soulo flow like the solar flare in the open air
So much smoke that I'm comatose, but I still want mo'
Tde generals, she ain't spiritual but she still want Soul
God bless, God body, no fear in nobody, no thing
Can I proceed? Collect all of my proceeds
Don't I flow like I don't bleed? Every cut is just dumb
After me there will be none I told you there is only one (Soul)
Yeah, and I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's sober hopin' so it's 'stood
I'm in Hollywood cause I remember when I had 50 Cent, up In Da Club
All my life I knew I was major, I don't need no major
I don't even write rhymes, I really shouldn't have to sign paper to dominate the
Game y'all praise on hand and knee, just waited till it came to me
I just kept it real with y'all, keeping it real with me

'Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere
Trying to stay high, as long as we down here
Listen closely, see what we bout here
Who really bout that, you'll see when the smoke clears
'Cause we really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here, yeah yeah yeah!)

Uh, and it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
Fuck the same hoes again, bumpin' ""Druggies Wit Hoes Again"" with my bros again
No, I want the world chico and everything in it
Every beverage with Codeine in it
How the fuck you say I sold my spirit?
I'm still taking blows at the Senate
Claims of Illuminati, I'm just tryna Illuminate
Praise to the most high, God, Jah, Allah, Yahweh
Selassie eye and I'm proud to say, I never need a 9 by my waist
Niggas still respect my game so celestials respect my space
And I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and it is still all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's over ho, it's overstood
I was overlooked, I went overboard now I'm overbooked
Ab-Soul, Luke Just, my life is like an open book
Read between the lines nigga
I did this shit legally blind nigga
Yeah, Soulo ho, Carson arson with Del Amo (Knock Knock!)
Tell your folks I said hello, I ain't never scared

'Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere
Trying to stay high, as long as we down here
Listen closely, see what we bout here
Who really bout that, you'll see when the smoke clears

These days, at this point in my life, you know what I mean
I kinda really wanna use music to help people get through their days
Instead of just staying in the dumps, just keep going.
Bring light to the situation, maybe, you know,
Try to find your own personal message in that incident,
That experience and try to move forward

Y'all got me, everything good, y'all can hear me?
Before we start, lemme just say this, lemme just say this
I'm dating you Day
Wait, wait, pause
No gay shit
Hold your remarks, what's the difference between a date and a day anyway Day?
A date is a day that's marked
I'm smart, and just cause I know you love 'em so much
I came with name flips for days, tailored just for Day
I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds
My database said Day the basehead that day to base head
Is he dope? No
Who gave Day the base, ball is what we do best
Flock his projects, that's a home run, Day
The baseball is what we do best
Carpe diem, that's how you say seize the day in French
I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life
I will never see the light of day again
Now witnessing this rare occasion I bear fruits of my labor this grape is green
I gotta eat on the go Day
I hope they told you that everything that Soul say don't go a long way, what?
A ho in Chipotle, no
This is food for thought, from a dog on top
We been nuts
There was a fool who thought we was new to this
But who knew this would end up, a glow stick in a uterus
That's light in a box
And that's light, that's light
But light like to lick twat a lot so that's right
That's what y'all call street?
No tales from the Crip this evening, he slip
Seems he forgot what the C meant
It's yo dumbass that thought that last part was so concrete
But I guess you'd have to be Ken to get that bar beat, pardon me
I bet right about now you feelin' like Jordan down in the Jordan Downs
In fact it's crazy that you even play ball to clear your thoughts before raw backwards
And that's cool, but for this round, save the bull before you let the Jordan Downs and Jordan down
Now, as for the crew
Well, uh, the villain been itchin' to skin a dog
And this nigga bought, what, a hundred and three dalmations?
It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it
And I'm a fan first
But it won't take too many seconds to leave you in a damn urn
You deserve this disservice
I put this man in ERs if he don't got no man nerves, man word
I'm expectin' some etiquette in your segment kid
I brought you to the 'Stu to show how we do
So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here
They can't see you
Wave your title to this tidal wave, we do
And you don't appear to be a peer to me, for real
You should kneel to me or somethin'
Fuck it, to keep it 100
You're nil to me, that's nothing
Heard they been raisin' raisins down on Grape Street, that's crazy right?
That's what happens when you expose them grapes to too much daylight
So your chances of standin'
Much smaller than my plan to defeat you
Wait, what, do I gotta put it in photosynthesis or somethin', son?
Shed some light on Day?
'Til he's cropped out
No not now, I won't need a plant to defeat you
The sequel, this movie, won't need to be continued
You finally encountered somethin' you can't counter, coward
You're counterfeit
You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy
To see quill drug over the counter
After your mother consumed you, you were the fruit of the womb
After you were born, I'm sure you wore Fruit of the Looms
Now I'm tryna figure out, is you from Grape Street, Crip?
Or just another fruit in this room?
It's crucial, you choose, I'm sure you don't want me to assume
I should be against the law to run into
Cause we all know in LA I'm double you, all so true
Today is the day I split Day in two
What the fuck has battle rap turned Day into?
Are you from Gotham or from Watts?, Are you Batman, Spawn, or Davon?
Did you really think ""Paul Walker"" was a dope song?
If so, you were wrong
Hold on, I got one more, and don't lie to me
Do you really have a Batmobile outside, my G?
Don't be so transparent, this nigga's light, through
If you don't know what transparent means, let me enlighten you
If it's transparent, that means that it lets the light through
So I should smack this trans' parents for lettin' light through
Like, he nerve of this cat
Lyin' with a motionless emotion
This nigga Day all bitch
Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get kilt
Do Quill got skill at all, homie?
It was some Braveheart shit, all I heard was Nas, homie
Did you really expect to last, Day?
You know Revelations say that we livin' in the last days
I mean, I see you skimmed through Genesis and Timothy but did you get to that page?
You got Gats?
You think your little arm'll get in the way of Armageddon?
Forget it Day, no, really, forget this day
If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time to see
Just how many people would say ""Yes"" to Day
Nobody, fam, nobody, fam
That's why I'm ahead to day
No, no body fam, that's why I'm a head today
No, nobody fam, that's why I'm ahead of Day
Somebody check the clock, I think I'm ahead a day
Send him to the choppin' block, off with the head of Day
It's only right I be blunt to Lyt
I only gave Lyt a match to light a blunt
I see I should have used the lighter instead
Chill Loc, we ain't smokin' no purple
We need the fire instead
When I think of daylight, I think of shit like
Breakfast, morning, birds singin', kids playin'
See where I'm goin'?
That means you better break fast, or I'll have your family mournin'
When that bird sings, kid, I ain't playin' and you know it
But you know what?
(Hold on, hold on, let me get you right, we have this shit)
Take this 500 before you clap this shit up
Say this, let me say this, let me just say this
These flashin' lights got Lyt flashin', nigga, for the glory
You're Buzz Lightyears from here, Quill, and you tellin' toy stories
You boys bore me, that's why I'm hoggin' all lanes
All your bars Häagen-Dazs, that's on everything
Day a dairy queen, Deluxe, bless king
Dearly beloved, all first verse, all first verse
You know I brought a hearst for the sausage you brought worst
Dearly beloved, here lies this little light of mine that tried to let it shine
And I hate that we have to
Hear the lies from this little light of mine that tried
To let it shine
But I'm ill, you men ate when I finished Lyt
You get it, Lyt?
That's how you ILL-u-min-ate, and finish Lyt, good night
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get you right
You got that for me? You got that for me?)
Brought you some complimentary TDE ski masks

Question, you know how many copies The Matrix sold?
It don't matter, The Matrix old
I double cats, I ask 'em if they seen the glitch
No, no, no
Face it, I got it covered
Prevail, they say the sail was a threat to Hell
The gravitational stitch cause some niggas seem down
They come up with this perfectly clean round
But I hope you not doin' this cause of fear
Of the pen, I'ma prove you pussy within
But I guess it's up to you to risk your career
I retire niggas, I'm the slow leak crew, I could OD too

He thought he Kelis get a baby victory
But all he got was ""Na's, son""
Check this out, he not ready
Either you fight back or I Ether you
Thought you could face what I hand you, well this is impeccable
Soon as I took a peek at you, you looked shocked
Peep at you, put everything at stake
Well done, this is beef, right?
Jesus, holy cow, cut the bull, soul before you get meatsliced
I'm from the third, I gotta try you
Guy you play Ryu, you might lose a Ken in a street fight
Night slow guiders with both sirens
You still couldn't see Lyt
Division, I got it covered, I'm so eye lit
Pilot, fly, I be the goblin
We battle for a stack, in fact they had to get a cataract 'cause I be the problem
But it's useless, use less filler
Excuse this, excuses, but, but, but
These ass-cheek niggas dead
You said you would fry Day previously
But that's what the last week nigga said
But, but, but, keep cool Joe cause dog crazy
Get down, we turn niggas vegetable if they don't let us up
He know the heat blowers like Daffy at the casino, nigga you better duck
But I tell them tails we never tuck
We gon' line that ass up
I from the Watts block for decision
My profession is stompin' squares the fuck out
We played hopscotch for a livin'
But that's def, that's just plain old def
It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen
Have a seat, picture this, picture this photo
This a Soulo bizard, hold up
Is it because he 'bout to get smoked?
Common roll the physics, so exquisite, thought I was in here dolo
No bro, somebody tell Soulo this not a solo mission
The deal closed, SoHo is it
Thought you could fuck wit Miguel I gotta code tho, split him
Look at your girl dead in her eyes and say ""Fuck Dorothy dog""
I'm toto dissin'
But at this moment, everybody in the room should be scared as Hell
As I release bars, they better bail
Objects that I process is parallel
Let's get this aligned
Minus sinus, the stuffy nose flew overhead, it's cold
Redemption, stay still, as I apply Dayquil
'Cause you look like you need medical attention, don't mind me
See where mind be is a mine, explosive
Interior is inferior, this is a hobby probably
Y'all see I got the drop on everybody
That's why I reign superior
Whether you like or not, it's Hell for you, ice plate
These blister niggas still can't overshadow a nice Day, remember
You did say you were Friday
But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets
Preacher for they peeps, you asshole
You in the motion to grab toes, you're reachin' for defeat
I tell 'em I got the foreign
Cut the sheep, it's all for the woolish
Game, I play is death, get sword for the hoodish
Actin', it's Tinactin, it's all for the footage
I'm dope, I'm practical, crack to you
I need a lot of space, the galactic crew, the actors knew
You feel it it's Felix, see what the old cat could do
But you got the roots stirred up
Gelatin dropped and slide, this game is stormchasin'
Based on whether you got the drive
Win rounds, destroy their whole city
Will they get toured? Nay, do you realize
I still got a break, brother
When I quake in action, think of Blake and Jackin'
Take cover
That's Lyt work, Soul
Cut your lights switch, see how the Lyt works, Soul
I cut the light switch off and your light switch off, Soul
Somebody get this nigga help
I mean, like, Soul, assist him
Get him help, I'm sendin' this nigga out the Solar System
I mean it's simple, Aretha Franklin, you a soul sister
(That's enough, man Imma have to throw one of these masks on, man
Should I finish him off?
Use the mask, Day
I ain't done)
And I told you once, I gotta give 'em the quill
And I gotta give 'em the skill
I be on mytip like I tried to give 'em the bill
New approach, Bull coach, I tried to give 'em the Phil
For Watts, starvin', gotta get us a meal
Bein' modest, this is modern astrology for the real
You can't back up defeat but I try to get up the hill
Cold, rack up the heat but I'm tired of niggas that grill
Chicago in my blood, but I used to be the shyest
Cat form, but now I'm back searchin' for the highest
Platform, see where I come from, it was sirens
Blackboards, eyelids see the violence, what is that for?
44 Shoot, they screamin', ""Who's that guy?""
Jesus, his face, they screamin', ""Who's that god?""
We be on the top, careers gettin' too high
They knew I would get a million dollars, what I do buy
That pink kid in the cup, that Majin Buu fly
Tragic, twin maggots, I grew up too fly
They askin, ""Who I?"" in front of that
They askin, ""Who I?"" in front of that triangle black
That's that guy that come with the side kangol hat
We take it back from slangin' packs to the stars mission
Older now, I'm in the Rover but it's not a Mars mission
Settle down, one child, marry, feel like I'm Marge pimpin'
Bitches wanna eat my shorts, feel like I'm Bart Simpson
I feel this a full moon, chocolate, dreams puddin'
They be likin' everything I do, they're teen wolfin'
But you got it, you got it bad
2Pac, don't rock a sag
Two watches, that's pocket change
Dude coppin' that clock exchange
Credit good, I'ma pull the card out
Better be hyesterectomy, show 'em how to ball out
Cough, they can't stomach 'em so they fall out
Whip, double roof, dog barkin' on the dog house
And I gotta give 'em the Lyt
My people in the struggle, I gotta give 'em a fight
Ain't no equal piece of puzzle, hope God'll give us the mic
Ain't no sequel to this puzzle, I gotta give us the life

I sabotage the wealthy and the rich and the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang

But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day

It's been a while, but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on
And eatin' swordfish, from gigantic portions
Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
What a fine act you got for
I don't know why I get so high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes

She held me tighter, told her, “Pass the weed

It’s me, it’s me baby

I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)

Man, how you gonna leave me like that?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon’ get right back
At least I thought so
I guess your negative energy and your insecurities
Drew me to drawing a blank
I got a new thing, and everything is straight
Wait, you wasn’t even the only one in the first place
Couldn’t even say if you knew better, you'd do better
Cause you knew better, and you still acting like a bitch
Texts all day but don’t say shit
It’s okay boo, I don’t blame you
I know that this backwards society raised you
Taught you to play on your phone and watch cable
So while I play on your mind like I’m a Jedi
I’m probably eating a ribeye, finna hop on a red eye
Rolling up the green that shit that give you them red eyes

Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I’ll wait
Yeah, that’s what I thought, I’m the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It’s Top Dawg, all I’m missing is the red hat
But don’t question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I’m guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta
But let me explain something, a paradox if you may
I threw all my fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today
And then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I’m saying
The game ain’t changed, we still changing the game

Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!

My first album was a set up
I was the little nigga Pac was talking to
When he said ""keep your head up""
Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise
Move the Yay or kiss the sky, for having dreams that 50 died
Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it
Say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me babbling ghost cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
It's wise to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me, yeah
Out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut

Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!

To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want
The Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the Raf rips

This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then tipped all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Aye, look what I ain't doin'
Aye, ridin' in foreigns
Aye, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry

So disrespect and gettin' checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never passed my mama no blunt, it kept my head straight
Less than deadweight, never been a problem to dump
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as the spliffs my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sit, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts

Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dumb-be-dumb-dumb be-dumb-be-dumb-dumb
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
A boom-a-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dumb-be-dumb-dumb be-dumb-be-dumb-dumb
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return

I'll kiss you, return to sender

ABBA,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanation, no questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",I Let the Music Speak,1981
ABBA,"Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room  

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room  

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room",Like an Angel Passing Through My Room,1981

You and I have reason to remember  

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong

The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance

Won't somebody tell me what I hear
In the distance, but drawing near
Is it only a storm approaching

ABBA,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing

And save it from the funny tricks of time

My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night

Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on

No one else sees it but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Lo que fu calidez
El frio invadio
A vez al pasar, tu y yo
Migramos con el sol

Hacia un verano nuevo
Sin oscuridad
Hoy que todo termino
No hay a quien culpar

Somos dos, que ayer
Vivimos soledad
Nuestra union se quebro
Con toda dignidad
Aun buscamos cielo azul
En nuesro caminar

Gracias por un gran amor
Y la felicidad
Hoy que todo termino
No hay a quien culpar

Bien se da que al caer
Hay posibilidad
De surgir otra vez
Y ver la realidad
Todo claro al final
No hay nada por probar

En el cruce del camino
Solo un nuevo andar
Hoy que todo termino
No hay a quien culpar

är det nöjen i en stor stad
eller tystnad på en ö
Att finnas till det är för mig
att se sommarängar blomma,
lyss till vågor från en sjö
Att se ett hav i solnedgången
Att se ett segel ligga still
Sommarkväll - att förnimma alla dofter
Det är då jag känner jag finns till
Att finnas till - det är att njuta stunder
Att finnas till - det är så stort för mig
Finnas till - det är ett herrens under
Att finnas till - det är att va' med dig!
Finnas till det är att sitta
med den vän man håller kärast,
kanske läppja ett glas vin
Att finnas till då för varann
medan staden redan sover,
kanske tända stearin
Att ligga där och känna värmen
från den man älskar - sådant vill
jag nog tro många tycker är att leva

ABBA,"Can you hear the drums Fernando
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

Hamlet iii part 2
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold
Then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry

So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn's chilling winds were blowing through the trees
And rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place

Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
And rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

Det räcker där
Ja
Nu hör jag alltså väldigt lite frida!

Free as a bumble bee
I'm down
And I feel depressed
Sitting here
Just waiting
For next bus traveling
Down town
It's a cry and a shame
Isn't it
A beautiful weather?
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this
I know what I like to be

As free
As a bumble bee
Take a zip of
Every flower
Free
As a bumble bee
What a way
Each lazy hour

What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Rubber ball man
A poster on the wall
Of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free

The hero of them all
You're a legend
I guess I never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be

Make the band stand
To a dream land, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands
And your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us screaming
Some of us dreaming
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man

Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man

Crying over you
I'm waiting for you, baby
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

I'm waiting for you, baby

Crying over
Little memories
Of things we used to do

He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

But I lead him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone

Just like that
As though he'd only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

There's a gentleness to everything you do
And it's rubbing off on me, I feel it too

When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over, baby
You know I will
I could never stay on my own

Givin' it all I got to give

Should I laugh or cry
He's dressed
In the striped pyjamas that I bought

On his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does

And me I get so tired

Should I laugh or cry

You are prison bound

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park

Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction

And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning

It's a dream, it's out of reach

And I dream I can spread my wings

Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I can spread my wings?

The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair, she's a leading lady

And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world

The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""That's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone, now we'd better hurry""

When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run

Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can? 
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be? 
Without a song or a dance what are we? 
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be? 
Without a song or a dance what are we? 
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

ABBA,"He had what you might call a trivial occupation 
he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station 
with no romance in his life - sometimes he wished he had a wife 

He read the matrimonial advertising pages 
the cries for help from different people, different ages 
but they had nothing to say, at least not until the day, 
when something special he read, this is what it said 

If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get 
two for the price of one 
We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get 
two for the price of one 

He called the number and a voice said ""Alice Whiting"" 
the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting 
he was amazed at his luck, the purest streak of gold he'd struck 
He said, I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling 
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling 
why don't we meet for a chat, the three of us in my flat 
I can't forget what I read 
this is what it said 

If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get 
two for the price of one 
We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.

But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

In the firelight Fernando

I could hear the distant drums

They were closer now Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

Lightning up a world 
Made for a boy and girl 
And love was new 
As morning dew 

The first song that I knew 
Told of skies for ever blue 
Clouds that disappear 
My darling dear 

The first song I heard 
Was the warbling of a bird 
Sending around 
A soulful sound 
Deep as the sea 
Like you and me 

And it's always a song 
And the changes that belong 
Melodies that bring 
The first song we sing.",First Song,1991
Abbey Lincoln,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon (La Lune Est Grise...Mon Coeur Aussi),1991
Abbey Lincoln,"Come with me my love 
And seize the day and live it 
Live it fully live it fast 
Never thinking once about 
Tomorrow 'til tomorrow's been and gone and past 
We'll pour the wine and fill the 
Cup of joy and drink it 
Drink as if it were the last 
Live just for life 

In Paris today in Amsterdam tomorrow 
Sixty minutes through the skies 
Fly with me to see the setting summer sun 
And stay with me to see it rise 
And say to the those who say 
To live this way is mad, 
That mad we'd rather be than wise 
Live just live for life 

Yesterday's a memory gone for good 
For ever, while tomorrow is a guess 
What is real is what is here and now 
The here and now is all that we possess 
So take my hand and we will take 
The moment, if for just the 
Moment's happiness, 
Live just for life 

If you let it, it will lead you 
Through the mystery and wonder 
Of a world you've never known before 
Share the splendors to be shared 
Magic places to explore 
Dare the dangers to be dared 
Cause life is all of this and more 
This and more, ooooooooh. 

Come with me to where 
The hills are green and still 
And filled with flowers to adore 
Come with me to where the laughter sings 
And drowns the pounding sounds of guns of war 
Come with me my love and 
Live for life and life will live 
For you forever more 
Live just live for life 
Live just live for life 
Live just live for life",Live for Life,1991

Who used to smile 
And say hello, 
And spin the world

The meadows of your mind 
Just think if winter comes
Can spring be far behind? 
Beneath the deepest snows 
The secret of a rose 
Is merely that it knows 
You must believe in spring 
Just as a tree is sure 
Its leaves will reappear
It knows its emptiness 
Is just a time of year 

The frozen mountain dreams 
Of april's melting streams 
How crystal clear it seems 
You must believe in spring
You must believe in love 
And trust its on its way 
Just as the sleeping rose 
Awaits the kiss of may 
So in a world of snow 
With things that come and go
With what you think you know 
You can't be certain of

Flying through a clouded sky
Sending mournful soulful sounds
Soaring over troubled grounds
Bird alone with no mate
Turning corners tempting fate
Flying circles in the air
Are you on your way somewhere
Gliding soaring on the wind
You're a sight of glory
Flying way up there so high
Wonder what's your story

Over where the grasses grow
Swingin' low then out of sight
You'll be singing in the night",Bird Alone,1991
Abbey Lincoln,"They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob

I was always there right on the job

With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread

Once I built a railroad, I made it run
Made it race against time

Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum

I will bring a book
That tells of strange and funny turns

To keep on living in a world
That never was my own
A world of haunted memories
Of other worlds unknown.
I'll tell them of the trouble here
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will sing a song
And tell them of a beggar's life
Where everything goes wrong
Where everybody's hopes and dreams
Are shattering by the wind.

I'll tell them of a ghostly world
Of us and they and him.
I'll tell them how the shadows fall
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will tell the stars
Of the battles that were lost
In a world of wars.
I will tell the rivers

Unlucky little hapless bright
She'd be lost out in the night

Like an old familiar itch , and as a fool, she's really rich

You came here from the middle west, and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.

Standing there 
Sometimes I'm freer.

Abbey Lincoln,"Within some walls of stone
Another world is waiting for it's own
Another time, another world, another world

The magic that is shown
Is or for another world
Dimensions still unknown
Beyond the pale, horizoned veil
A world unknown

A technologic sphere
With tones and music's chords to hear
For conversations far away
With ships that fly and lights that play

The years that come and go
Are bringing us another world to know
Maybe a laugh, perhaps a frown
A way to go, a common ground, another world

Another time has come
Another world is here to meet the sun
A digit here, a circle there, a life to share

Another time is here
Another dawn that whispers in my ears
A different sound, a point of view, a shade of blue

The strangest thing to see
Are things with you and me
Lost somewhere in the night
A song of love, the guiding light

A time has come and gone
Some memories are captured in a song
Some stories told, an artist's hand
Something to find among the sand
Something to hold, remembering
Another world, another world, another world",Another World,1999
Abbey Lincoln,"Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole,
To some blackbirds sittin' on a fence,
Oh, the lord gave me a soul,
But, forgot to give me common sense.

Said the blackbirds, well, well, well.
What the thunder would you do with common sense? 
Said the scarecrow,would be pleasin'
Just to reason out the reason
Of the wishes and the whyness and the whence

If I had an once of common sense
(If he had an ounce of common sense)

(Well, what would you do scarecrow?)

I would while away the hours
Conferin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain.

I'd unravel every riddle,
For every individual,
In trouble or in pain.
With the thoughts I'd be thinkin',
I could be another lincoln,
If I only had a brain.

Oh I, could tell you why,
The ocean's near the shore.
I could think of things I never thought before,
Then I'd sit, and think some more.

I would not be just a nothin',
My head all full of stuffin',
My heart all full of pain.
I would dance and by merry,
Life would be a dingle derry,
If I only had a brain.

I could think of things I never thought before

For the things I can't explain.

And be even worthy of you,

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Whenever the blues become my only song,

When at first my kiss you declined, (your kiss I declined)
On the light in your eyes when you surrender, (I surrender)

Dans cette maison perdue
Au bout du monde
Au bout du monde?
Tu es grande et tu t'ennuies
La lune brille dans ton ventre

Caroline, le vois-tu?
Dans le printemps revenu
Un oiseau tombe
Un oiseau tombe
L'oiseau avait fait son nid
À la fenêtre de ta chambre

Ô Caroline, que fais-tu dans ce château disparu?
Le puits est sec et l'amour est bu
Caroline, tu n'iras plus pleurer dans le jardin
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Tu t'en vas demain

Laisse-la derrière toi
La prière de ton père
À genoux 
Sur le prélart
Son souhait ne sera qu'un souhait;
La vierge n’est qu’une image

Laisse-la derrière toi
La chanson de ta mère 
Prisonnière
Dans le trou de sa guitare
L'amour est un oiseau qui se tait
Quand on le met en cage

Ô Caroline, que fais-tu dans ce paradis de glace?
Ici la vie n'est plus qu'un songe, qu'une trace
Caroline, tu le vois bien qu'ils ont fermé leurs mains
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Tu t'en vas demain

Prends ta robe et ton bijou
Dis bye bye à ta doudou
L'oiseau t'appelle
L'oiseau t'appelle
Réveille pas le malin, la maline
C'est le moment Caroline

Ô l'escalier qui descend
Vole, vole, ô mon enfant
Ouvre tes ailes
Ouvre tes ailes
Tu jouiras comme jouit l'orpheline
Tu es libre Caroline

Ô Caroline, éteins ta fièvre, le temps est venu
D'aller donner tes lèvres aux lèvres inconnues

Abby Dobson,"Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones
Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on his way
They closing in on me, I feel like every day
Music saves me, soothing like the navy
But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars
So I took the vibe with me using my life
Yep, I propose the main music my wife
If ever need to call a nigga music's my night
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice
If I degraded and I haven't even cried to
I watch purpose prophesize about going through
Music ain't the knowledge itself
And I'm the knowledge itself, then I acknowledge your wealth

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal lines
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me
I'm redefining the space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you, papa, when I google monogamy
Now all the people who go irresponsibly
Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy
So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use
Each of lyrical vestibule, let me tell you what's best for you
My music gives you a message true or respect is due
But music is emotion, that's lost for me intellectual
A tree in form of a far is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create the same
Of course you're nothing but a pair in making, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I was born on the afterbeat, I'm like ron for Johnson
When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it
Lauryn went, looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
Willing to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade the death like we got a fear of living
Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising
Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism
The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us

And he could run before he walked",Before He Walked,2013
Abby Dobson,"From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake
No different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is ""Love & Hip Hop""
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Used to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick
B.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''
No objections, being an object
Major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him
In her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting a part of his suffering
And this young man clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food; Big Mac's
You don't want no problems, fix that
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace

Can a thug get a massage if I needed your hands
And would you jump in the ride if I told you to bring me them thangs
If a nigga tried to get at me would you ride for me
And if you couldn't swim would you take a dive for me

Would you argue, fuss and fight when I need you to chill

Help me get my hustle on, climb up on the mill with

And if the coppers stop us I know you'll take the charge for me

People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.
 
I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.

In deep despair or lonely nights 
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real
 
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And every thing's good in the world tonight

When smokey sings, I hear violins
When smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And smokey sings, he sings

Elegance in eloquence for sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes, I match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies soothe the rage
When lovers hearts catch fire

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And every thing's good in the world tonight

When smokey sings, I forget everything, yeah

With the heaven she brings

Now that you're gone I still want you back

Remembering that part, all of my heart

You hook me up a rendez-vous at your place 
Your lipstick and your lip gloss seals my fate

Sentimental powers might help you now 
But skip the hearts and flowers, skip the ivory towers
You'll be disappointed and I'll lose a friend

No, I won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow
Or that pleasure and pain
Sunshine and rain might make this love grow

And you took me back
But deep down inside

When summer ends and skies burn grey
So I walk to the ocean

It's time we kissed the clouds goodbye
From now on it's strictly blue sky
Come rain and shine

Now that you're gone I still want you back

Remembering that part
All of my heart

You hook me up, I rendezvous at your place
Your lipstick and your lip gloss seals my fate
Sentimental powers might help you now
But skip the hearts and flowers, skip the ivory towers
You'll be disappointed and I'll lose a friend

No I won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow
Or that pleasure and pain, sunshine and rain
Might make this love grow

But I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact

In deep despair on lonely nights

The slyest rhymes - the sharpest suits

Should I say, yes I match his best
Then I would be a liar

Abd Al Malik,"Descendre à Gare de l’Est le cœur en bandoulière 
Strasbourg était le bout de l’horizon hier
Une certaine vision du succès mise en bière
Être adulte c’est faire fi des regards travers
Cette ville est une vieille fille comme Châtelet-Les-Halles
Au fond une fille bien qui joue les femmes fatales
Un lieu est toujours l’allégorie d’un être 
Qu’enseignes-tu ville-lumière si ce n’est le refus de l’échec

Ici on pourra tout recommencer
On verra à nouveau poindre l’horizon
Ici on pourra vraiment tout effacer
On aura plus besoin de se faire une raison
Ici on pourra tout recommencer
On verra à nouveau poindre l’horizon
Ici on pourra vraiment tout effacer

Dompter le sud de notre fougue à Gare de Lyon
Embastiller ce jugement qui change les gens en cons
En érodant leur cœur sous l’effet de cette pierre ponce
Être à l’autre comme Bashung fut à Chloé Mons
OK Wallen est Elsa moi Louis Aragon (C’est pour rire)
La culture mime Marceau une même Nation
Des châtelains d’un autre genre vivent à Château d’Eau
Des Rastignac en dreadlocks comme dans Le Père Goriot

Ici on pourra tout recommencer
On verra à nouveau poindre l’horizon
Ici on pourra vraiment tout effacer
On aura plus besoin de se faire une raison

Qui foule Le Champs de Mars d’une existence Invalide

Abd Al Malik,"Ça faisait presque une demi-heure qu’il était seul maintenant
Ses potes étaient rentrés chez eux
Et lui était resté assis sur ce banc
Il fumait sa dernière cigarette
Et le soleil s’était couché depuis longtemps
Il salua au loin un mec qu’il ne connaissait pas vraiment
Et se demanda où est-ce que ce type pouvait bien aller si tard
Lui-même s’était levé tôt, vers 14h,
Et au PMU avait joué au billard
Avec des gars qu’étaient plus jeunes que lui de plusieurs années
Comme il fut une gloire il n’y a pas si longtemps, nombreux tirent
Encore une certaine fierté d’être vus à ses côtés
Ce qu’il avait bu et fumé entre 15h et 18h aurait mis KO n’importe qui
Mais lui était toujours frais et pimpant
Question d’habitude et peut-être de génération
C’est ce qu’il s’est dit en tous cas quand deux gamins de sa bande improvisée
Vomirent presque simultanément sous le téléviseur que personne ne regardait
Il quitta le PMU seul et s’abrita bientôt sous un abribus
Parce qu’il se mit à pleuvoir pendant qu’il marchait en plus…

Septième étage de la tour en forme de demi-lune
Appartement de gauche en face du vieux vide-ordures
Un vieux couple d’origine malgache regarde les infos sur le câble
Côte à côte enfoncé dans un épais canapé beige
Leur fils cadet maintenant en prison leur avait offert ce téléviseur volé
Ce qui les rendait à leur insu coupables de recel
Le voisin célibataire et efféminé de l’étage du dessous donnait 
Régulièrement des coups sur le mur de son salon attenant à
L’appartement d’à côté
Parce qu’une furieuse rumba-rock congolaise depuis plusieurs minutes rugissait
Il (notre personnage principal) était revenu dans cette fête africaine
Dans sa chambre d’enfant
Ses parents n’avaient pas demandé d’explication ?
Il allait rester temporairement
Il était allongé sur un lit étroit et regardait le plafond
Ses vêtements étaient encore un peu mouillés
Et lui cuvait difficilement
Il savait comment faire depuis longtemps pour ne penser à rien
Il se disait avec d’autres mots que philosopher donc avoir une réflexion morale
Dans ce monde cela faisait plus de mal que de bien
Alors il s’abstenait quant au cogito mais se pétait le crâne à l’artificiel
En utilisant toujours la même recette : beuh, shit, whisky et/ou Heineken

Il se leva du lit, se jeta au sol et fit quelques pompes
Il s’essouffla vite mais avait donc la preuve de ne pas être dans une tombe
Il imputa cette croyance à l’oxygène qu’il respirait difficilement
Vu que ce réflexe était l’apanage des vivants
Il se réinstalla dans son lit et s’endormit sans remords et sans transition
Comme d’habitude il se réveilla quelques heures après, amer
Se rendant toujours compte en regardant autour que sa déchéance était réelle
Il n’était définitivement plus une star du rap
Plus une star tout court si l’on voulait être exact
Mais il était vivant et même s’il se tuait sciemment c’était devenu une obsession
Ses souvenirs de gloire étaient momentanés
Comme d’habitude, lorsqu’il savait qu’il lui restait de quoi fumer
Il écouta autour de lui et la nuit était profonde
Il roula un joint et, dès la première bouffée, eut le même sourire que la Joconde
Joint à la bouche il enfila son blouson,
Ses vieilles Nike Air Jordan,
Ferma la porte de l’appartement et dévala les escaliers, puis la rue
Comme s’il était en cavale

Il avait couru jusque de l’autre côté du périphérique
Et s’arrêta brusquement plié en deux par l’anxiogène
Qui lui brûlait la poitrine
Il était à présent entre les numéros 42 et 54 de la rue de Clignancourt
A égale distance de la peur du lendemain et des cicatrices que laisse l’amour
Il ne savait pas qu’ici se dressa un jour un grand édifice de briques rouges
Au centre d’un grand et beau parc qui n’existe plus, à la luxuriante verdure
Trônait il y a une paire de siècles et des poussières 
Cette bâtisse couleur pourpre
Comme un symbole pensé par l’homme de tout ce qui à la fois
S’oppose et s’épouse
Lui n’en avait rien à battre
Vivait le temps et l’espace comme une injure
Jusque très récemment il s’était vécu un peu comme en Amérique
Mais à l’époque où Malcolm Little
Etait encore bien loin d’être Malcolm X
Il jouait en national mais s’était convaincu
Qu’il évoluait en première ligue
Parce que dire la vérité était à celui qui savait le mieux se mentir
Et puis
Les gens ne t’aiment pas, c’est l’image qu’ils te renvoient
Tu finis par ne plus t’aimer toi-même
Et tu détestes même tous ceux qui ont un peu d’amour pour eux-mêmes
Donner existence aux fantasmes les plus dingues
Faire porter à ses colères adolescentes de drôles de fringues
Crier au complot parce qu’on n’achète plus ses complaintes
C’est l’incohérence qui a finalement porté plainte
Et puis…
Des fois c’est des toutes petites choses qu’ont vraiment de l’importance
Y a juste à se souvenir de la simplicité de notre enfance
Se voir dans une glace dans le HLM de ses parents
Et se rendre compte qu’on est vieux
Quand un type qu’a pourtant une barbe
Nous appelle Monsieur
Se noyer dans l’envie et crier c’est injuste comme au secours
Regarder aux alentours et se demander qui pourrait sauver l’Amour
Faire de la musique pour préserver ses rêves
Mais que faire quand tous nos rêves ont fini par se taire
Se souvenir de ses vies antérieures en s’imaginant notre futur
Confondre la normalité avec la pire des injures
Se rendre compte qu’on apprend toujours trop peu de l’Histoire
Le cœur affamé, vide d’un trop plein de désespoir
Et puis
Les gens ne t’aiment pas, tu finis par ne plus t’aimer toi-même
Et tu détestes même ceux qui ont un peu d’amour pour eux-mêmes
Soudain il reprit sa course sans pourquoi, sans direction
Courir plus vite que la vie, quitte à en perdre la raison

Ça faisait presque une demi-heure qu’il était seul maintenant
Ses potes étaient rentrés chez eux
Et lui était resté assis sur ce banc
Il fumait sa dernière cigarette
Et le soleil s’était couché depuis longtemps
Il salua au loin un mec qu’il ne connaissait pas vraiment

Vous savez, je m’attends chaque jour à partir
Mais je ne m’attendais pas ce soir-là à mourir

Contrairement à ce que l’on dit, ce ne sont pas des images
Mais des mots qui ont défilé dans ma tête au moment de ma mort.
Je partais, mais je n’étais pas triste, d’ailleurs je ne comprenais déjà plus ce mot.
Personne n’allait me manquer.
Il y a une évidence dans la mort comme lorsqu’on vient au monde, je suppose.
C’est juste qu’à présent c’était fini, il n’y avait rien de poignant là-dedans.
Et puis ma famille…
Et puis tous ceux que j’appelais amis, et puis tous ceux que j’avais croisés et que je ne connaissais pas…
Et puis les gens autour de moi… Ah oui il n’y a personne !
Ce n’est même pas douloureux, je ne les vois déjà plus.

Abd Al Malik,"C’était pendant les vacances d’été dans la cité
À l’époque j’étais à peine ado ; il y a donc déjà quelques années
Dans la rue je rêvais, assis sur mon vieux vélo cross
Et de temps en temps regardais à  gauche et à droite en attendant les autres
J’étais toujours à l’heure lorsqu’on se filait des rencards 
J’étais le plus jeune et le plus sérieux c’était en puissance tout le drame de mon histoire
Les autres arrivèrent donc sans se presser chacun sur son cheval à deux roues
Ils me regardèrent comme si j’étais fou alors Mustaaf pour me rassurer il m’a dit que c’était
                                                                              Eux pas moi qu’étaient chelou 
Après s’être copieusement insulté pour se convaincre qu’on s’aimait
Comme un essaim d’abeilles on s’est tous envolé
Je pédalais sur l’asphalte de mon destin 
Comme un poisson dans l’eau qui se rêve requin
Mon frère aîné était là aussi mais ça l’ennuyait que je sois de la partie
C’était qu’une réticence passagère selon moi et le temps allait confirmer mon avis
Quand la roue s’est désolidarisée de la fourche de mon vélo je l’ai regardé rouler x3
 Et quelques secondes après l’accident mon frère m’a pris dans ses bras et on a pleuré x3

Refrain
Tout le temps qui passe qui c’est écoulé
Et les moments que j’arrive pas a à oublier x2

Le surlendemain après-midi devant la JEEP le centre de prévention du quartier
Je jouais au ping-pong sur la table bétonnée 
J’avais des pansements de partout à cause de l’accident alors par pitié on me laissait gagner
Majid était là comme mon petit frère et moi comme son frère aîné
Qui pouvait se douter que dans quelques années le destin allait nous trier
Les mecs autour de la table ils gueulaient « J’prends le gagnant, j’prends le gagnant ! »
C’étaient nos raquettes et nos balles mais on leur a laissé tellement que c’était plus marrant
On est allé ensuite dans la cave de mon immeuble pour récupérer nos vélos
L’entrée était encombrée par des grands qui pompaient de la colle et ça nous faisait flipper grave même s’ils étaient tous K.O
On a récupéré tant bien que mal  nos motos sans moteur
Et on a roulé comme des fous jusqu’au Parc Schumeister
Juste avant de prendre le pont on s’est dit vient on fait la course
C’est là que le pied de Majid il a glissé de la pédale et qu’il est tombé à mi-course
Je me suis arrêté catastrophé et je l’ai regardé rouler x3 
Et quelques secondes après son accident je l’ai pris dans mes bras et on a pleuré x3

Refrain

Le week-end d’après tellement qu’il faisait soif
On a décidé d’aller se baigner au Lac Achard
Avant qu’on y aille deux amis qui sont mort depuis 
Se sont mis à me vanner devant la bande parce que le respect n’a pas de prix
Ils étaient plus grands que moi alors j’ai rien dit
Mustaaf il a bien vu que j’étais dégoûté alors il m’a dit :
« Je te prends à l’arrière de mon vélo comme ça t’auras pas à pédaler 
Vu qu’ tes plaies elles sont pas encore vraiment cicatrisées ! »
Je voulais refuser par fierté mais je me suis dit “Mahlich“
Dans ce contexte ça voulait dire vas –y c’est pas grave je m’en fiche
Alors on s’est tous mis en mouvement et on est parti en gueulant
Quelque part entre “ La horde sauvage “ et “La guerre des boutons“
C’était à l’époque…que dis-je, à la grande époque de Bernard Hinault
Ça faisait vraiment classe en ce temps-là de faire du vélo
On était plus de cinquante sur la route t’imagine
Têtes d’enfants déjà cassées et gueules citadines
Je sais plus trop d’où est venue la queue-de-poisson
Un coup de poisse en plein milieu du peloton
Je ne sais ni pourquoi, ni comment mais je suis le seul à être tombé et à avoir roulé x3
Et quelques secondes après mon accident on s’est tous pris dans les bras et on a pleuré x3

Mais peut-il réellement se faire sans nous peut-il réellement se faire sans toi 

Refrain

Et si tu ne te reconnais pas comment me reconnaîtrais-tu
C’est vrai ça qu’est-il donc advenu
Pour qu’on finisse comme si nous étions étrangers
On a tellement pris appui sur nos vanités
Éternellement Adam et Eve nous sommes
Les cœurs se brisent et lentement s’additionnent
Le monde est ainsi fait n’est-ce pas
Mais peut-il réellement se faire sans nous peut-il réellement se faire sans toi

Abd Al Malik,"S’entendre dire, s’attendre à ce que ses secrets se livrent
Vivre sa propre existence comme s’il s’agissait d’un film
Qui y a-t-il derrière ces idées toutes faîtes

Semblable et différent dire et faire semblant
Faire comme si l’on portait tous le même vêtement
Ce n’est pas si évident que ça de faire la part des choses
Voir la différence entre la pose et la prose
Et le temps nous dira qui a raison x2

Refrain :
Et cette vie m’étreint, me teint couleur lunaire quand je brille au-dedans comme un néon
Il faudrait juste que ce soleil de glace puisse s’éteindre comme on éteindrait un néon x2

Au fond suis-je en accord avec ce qu’il y a au fond de moi
Est-ce moi ou un autre lorsque je baisse les bras
C’est peu dire que mes manquements m’obsèdent
Même l’idée d’un mea culpa m’est devenu obscène
Craindre et espérer si demain devenait 
Se changeait en bien plus qu’une simple idée
La vérité est dans les cris dans les larmes du faqir
Et la lumière illumine quand l’ego se déchire 

Et le temps nous dira qui a raison x2

Jubile comme les étoiles brillent à l’intérieur
La rue s’illumine quand je marche à l’extérieur
Ne cherche-t-on pas tous un peu Billie Jean
Perdu dans ce monde et celui des jinns
Et je devine que ce qu’on me destine
Alimente cette lumière dans ma poitrine
Je suis un laser pas un looser
Tous ceux qui se méprennent finissent dans la torpeur

Rap féerique comme Hiro Mashima

Maintenant que l’on brandit la même bannière
Voilà le grand soir la haine s’est enfin pendue
A présent la mélancolie ne rougira plus

J’veux pas finir ma vie aigri

Voilà qu’on ne se regarde plus travers
Maintenant qu’on sait bien que nos rêves sont frères
Voilà comment le réel et l’espoir se sont entraperçus
Main dans la main à présent ils ne se quittent plus

Every man want a good girl, every man want a good girl
Girls dem plenty and the whole of them look good
Trust me some no really act as they should
Bad principles from birth to childhood
Old dirty ways gone up inna adulthood.
Anytime you see a girl you like investigate it
Hard core no want no girl who bend up and switch
Think me like fe call a girl skettel and bitch
Who no have nu pride they deserve it.

I do want a good girl Yes I do
Plan to search the whole world
I prefer girls than pearls
It?s my decision.

Some of them barefaced
And want fe give you a jacket
Tell them say it definitely can?t fit.
Still insist, you ultimately park it
When she touch the turf, tell her exit.
Met few girls with a lot of bad habits
All have in common, search yu pockets
Wake up next morning can?t find yu wallet
Few hours away she?s on a taxi.

Now them sitting quite easy pon them rump
Them conscience want bury cause it stink like skunk
Them judgment.

And don't give a damn who want vex

Cold blooded murderers and some alibis
False statements cover up them lies, lies.

Tough luck life threatening diseases

I wanted to buy something to eat to kill the hunger
Then I remembered that my guitar needed two stings
That were broken I prefer to feed my soul.

How many mountains do we have to climb?
How many rivers of tears to quench the pain?
How long is the journey
It seems so endless
But I have to hold on, hold on.
Religion has been a stumbling block
It haunts me everyday
Will I ever clear this way?
I'm man enough to let you know at times
I'm skeptical of that man called Christ
Even though he gave his life.
How can I survive in a church, a refuge for my soul?
When the livity unfold is different from the word being told
How dare you justify your wicked ways
With quoting from the scripture?
You're the better, worse than anything else.

Unfortunately, I've been stereotyped
on how to treat a woman
I'm a product of a one night stand
If you happen to be my father
And you're listening to my song
You're damned outright and wrong.
My mom was just a sick woman
She lost her mind at twelve
But you chose to satisfy yourself.
I lost a woman that I truly loved

Abdel Wright,"Sit with me awhile
Let me tell you about a part of our country
At the place Stony Gut back in 1865
Lived a man Paul Bogle who was everything

A good man should be
But they hanged him by the courthouse
An example for Jamaica to see
They hanged him by the courthouse

An example for Jamaica to see.
A man who followed Jesus
And whose actions were in line with his teachings
Who every Sunday morning

The gospel would endeavour to preach
Who understood the suffering of the people
He plainly could feel
But they hanged him by the courthouse

An example for Jamaica to see
They hanged him by the courthouse
An example for Jamaica to see.
With the men from Stony Gut

Paul Bogle did come down that day
Through the bushes by the hills
Until they reached the town of Morant Bay
The reasons for his warnings and his actions

They could not believe
So they hanged him by the courthouse
An example for Jamaica to see
They hanged him by the courthouse

An example for Jamaica to see.
That was like yesterday, Still happening today
History use to tell us That Paul Bogle was really a traitor
Who murdered and rebelled

Against the peaceful government of the day
Now we can see clearly
And we finally know the reasons indeed
Why they hanged him by the courthouse

An example for Jamaica to see
They hanged him by the courthouse
An example for Jamaica to see.
That was like yesterday, Still happening today

But to me he's an angel of joy

Dirty hands! dirty face!
Leads the neighbors a chase
But his smile, his little smile, is as cute as can be

Making noise, breaking toys
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're his Mother's
And they're a vision to me

And when my work is done
Coming home, coming home to the setting sun
From the gate he'll start to run
And then, ohh, I'll kiss my boy

Abe Lyman,"Everything is lovely
When you start to roam;
The birds are singin', the day that you stray,
But later, when you are further away,
Things won't seem so lovely
When you're all alone;
Here's what you'll keep saying
When you're far from home:

Mammy,
Mammy,
The sun shines east, the sun shines west,
I know where the sun shines best
Mammy,
My little mammy,
My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy.
I'm comin',
Sorry that I made you wait.
I'm comin',
Hope and trust that I'm not late, oh oh oh

For one of your smiles,
My Mammy! Oh oh oh

I'm so sorry that I made you wait!

I was mighty true to you.
I've decided something I did made you run away

And the phone don't ring, I cry,
While you whisper 'Nighty Nighty"" to somebody else
I'm mighty blue.

Abe Most,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

How can I go on dear without you

Langs me heen gaan huizen
Het is stil achter de ruiten

In blauwverlichte treinen

Je hart is zo dichtbij me
Maar het klopt niet
Het is al lang verleden tijd
Je zwarte haren en je lach

Dat je heel de wereld voor mij was
Het zit nog veel te diep in mij
Dat ik mocht delen wat jij had
Je door mijn haren ging en zei

Je kent mijn stem niet
Wie ik ben is wat je nu ziet
Wil je dansen met illusies
In gedachten

Ben je verder dan het heden
Wil je terug naar je verleden

Dat je heel de wereld voor mij was
Het zit nog veel te diep in mij
Dat ik vergat hoe jij me zag
Dat ik zo anders ben dan jij

Se ríe la razón
Al sur de mis ojos 
Se endulza el sabor

Que no es de paz 
Que no es de odio 
Ni de traición 
Solo es canción, no es nada más

Dejo el alma fluir 
Entregado me acerco 
A la inmensa pasión 
Me alimenta el destello 
De tu luz en mi voz

Lo que sos

Su infinita luz 
Sobre las abras de la mañana 

No alcanza la luz certera

De desandar un poema

Calma la tempestad 
La ráfaga de tu recuerdo
Bebe la quietud de la soledad 
La transforma en un cielo

Vuelvo hasta el principio otra vez 
Pero se me escapa y me queda el tiempo al revés

Se hace parte de mi tiempo

Me callo porque ha ganado la razón al corazón

Y aunque otro me acompañe,
En silencio te querré tan sólo a ti

Igual que una flor resignada decora un despacho elegante,
Prometo llamarle amor mío al primero que no me haga daño
Y reír será un lujo que olvide cuando te haya olvidado

Pero igual que se espera como esperan en la Plaza de Mayo
Procuro encender en secreto una vela no sea que por si acaso
Un golpe de suerte algún día quiera que te vuelva a ver
Reduciendo estas palabras a un trozo de papel

Abel Pintos,"Aquí sigo contando los segundos
Desde que me abrazó la soledad
Desde que te me fuiste sin maletas
Un viaje que es de ida y nada más

Vuelve
Que un beso nos quedó pendiente
Oh, vuelve
Que no estoy lista para perderte

Si estuvieras aquí, sería tan fácil vivir
Darías azules de gris, que nublan mi mundo
Si estuvieras aquí, ya no dolería seguir
Buscándole el sentido a cada paso de este rumbo
Si tú estuvieras aquí

De a ver sabido de ese último día
Te habría hecho desayuno y conversar
Con un te quiero el tiempo frenaría
Pero el destino se negó a esperar

Oh, vuelve
Que no estoy lista para perderte

No, no no, vuelve
Que recordar no es suficiente
Oh, uelve

Abel Pintos,"Ella se desliza y me atropella 
Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Sé que el día que la pierda volveré a sufrir 
Por ella, que aparece y que se esconde
Que se marcha y que se queda
Que es pregunta y es respuesta 
Que es mi oscuridad, estrella

Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda 
Va conmigo pero no sé dónde va 
Mi rival, mi compañera, que está tan dentro de mi vida 
Y, a la vez, está tan fuera
Sé que volveré a perderme 
Y la encontraré de nuevo 
Pero con otro rostro y otro nombre diferente y otro cuerpo 
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva
Nunca me responde si al girar la rueda

Ella se hace fría y se hace eterna 
Un suspiro en la tormenta
A la que tantas veces le cambió la voz 
Gente que va y que viene y siempre es ella 
Que me miente y me lo niega
Que me olvida y me recuerda 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Y al llamarla nombro a otra 
A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea 
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar 
Que hay quien no tiene corazón 
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema, no no

Y, ¿ si fuera ella? 
No, no, oh no

A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

¿Era? ¿quién me dice si era ella? 
Y, si la vida es una rueda y va girando 
Y nadie sabe cuándo tiene que saltar y la miro 
Y, ¿si fuera ella? Y, ¿si fuera ella?","Y, ¿Si Fuera Ella?",2017
Abel Pintos,"Por ese palpitar, que tiene tu mirar
Yo puedo presentir, que tu debes sufrir
Igual que sufro yo, por esta situación
Que nubla la razón, sin permitir pensar

En que ha de concluir, el drama singular
Que existe entre los dos, tratando simular
Tan solo una amistad, mientras en realidad
Se agita la pasión, que envuelve al corazón

Y que me obliga a callar
¡Yo te amo, yo te amo!

Tus labios de rubi, de rojo carmesí
Parecen murumurar, mil cosas sin hablar
Y yo que estoy aqui, sentado frente a ti

Me siento desagrar, sin poder conversar
Tratando de decir, tal vez sea mejor
Me marche yo de aqui, para no vernos más
Total que más me da, yo se que sufrire
Pero al final tendré, tranquilo el corazón

Y así podré gritar
¡Yo te amo, yo te amo!

Tus labios de rubi, de rojo carmesí
Parecen murumurar, mil cosas sin hablar
Y yo que estoy aqui, sentado frente a ti

Once again as predicted left my broken heart open

Said that we can do it
Why'know I want to do it again

It's no accident we've touched each other's lives

It's a two-faced liar that you can't defend

Abhorrent,"The mother of all that is evil
Her lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
The priestess roars, ""Get down on your knees""
The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of enchantress
Spellbound searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf
My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heart beat my own
The sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned
Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies
Her hidden will to kill in disguise",She Wolf,1999

Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah

I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

Blue tells the heavens
Fall from the sky

I feel the shadows
Of time's own longing
Falling away

Wait for sunrise

Holds to the light

And I'll live on earth in peace for evermore

It lifts the heart and gives us wings to fly

Abiodun Oyewole,"My lord, hear thy prayer
As we sit amongst our fathers

From black Israelites to a liberal life, young guy from prison
Fight the system, Muslim, Jews and Christian
The hoodlum serving food in kitchens, politician, lawyer
Judges, destroy the brothers, amongst the youngsters
Dumpster, project hallways, equal more graves
Add it up, since the fourth grade, minus that, from the gun claps
Now divide that from the cats who ever slung crack, whoever done that
To all races, faces and man, with holes in his hand
He will even bracelets, or race our soul where we stand
My eyes, have seen hell, between jail, and bullet shells
Heard some words from the both Bushes yell
It ain't kill Saddam, we build the 'Nam
Close both palms, shut my eyes, then reply
Old Jerusalem, we criminals, Subliminal's click
Two Eilan live on, we toast to biblical scripts, come on

[Chorus]
I want you to ride it (for the shadow of death)
I feel nobody (there's no one else)
I read for my one's
I want you to ride it (for the shadow of death)
I feel nobody (there's no one else)
I rise like the sun, and shine

And I ain't cryin', and I ain't layin' down to dyin'
If I'm lyin', you can throw me off the Mountain of Xian
The law be like fuck this, trap 'em in a chair and fry 'em
I write doctrines, everything I spit is a psalm
Walk the hood, with holes in my feet and palms
Throw on crown made of ice, millennium Christ
I bled with Malcolm, til the struggle gave my life
I walk through the valley of death, scorched through hell's fire
Cell 33's a lot, in Elmira, grew wiser
Learned my culture, from old timers
Dark conscious, made in an image, doing the knowledge
Like, extraterrestrial beings, the all seeing
Out the sun roof screamin', clappin' the mack demon
My success is a journey, not a destination of faces
Snakes layin' in waiting, congrogatin' with Satan
Days of Gamora, need more, some water, I'm shakin'
My ancestors is cryin', I'm feelin' tears of the rain
Baptized in the Nile, and I'm trapped in pain

The Black Market (tact!)
The Black Market (tact!)

As it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
As we walk through the shadows of death
We'll find a way to win
This is the last will and testament
Of a light that's been dimmed
Of a heart that's lost it's rhythm
And attacks it's own reflection
Eyes of a blind, to the beauty of themselves
And souls of the so sacred, books were written
Temples were built, Jesus was born
In the womb of our love, for mankind
And this is the last sacrament, this is the last offering
The last jester, to spark the fire, to lift the spirit
Before the light turns back to black
Before the waves become a tidal, before the moon bleeds rivers of despair
And the stars become black holes in the sky
This is a final call, a final message
To those who think they know, and those who don't want to know
A damn thing",The Final Call,2005

Abir Haronni,"Troubled tears, they'll land you there
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel, is not real, not real
The fear that you feel, is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do

Look, the saddest story comes from those who once had the glory
Had the foreigns, diamond watches and the baddest shorties
Now they in their latter 40s, bunch of kids, scattered shorties
No respect from the neglect, they call they daddy Corey
I'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me
There's levels to this shit, it's different categories
Can't be like them niggas out here, looking fat and gordie
They ain't never won no rings, but be mad at Horry
Talkin bout, ""Man that nigga don't deserve that shit""
Like ""I was really in these streets, I used to serve that shit""
We started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit
Get it while the gettins' good, after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night, but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hitting it, be too late to swerve that shit
That's a young mistake, Lord knows I made me some
I love getting brain, that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb
Only feelings for this bitch, you been shoulda gave me some
I knew some niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs
Drink the whole fucking juice and never saved me some
I know how young niggas feel, I had to live through shit
See the world as constipated, nobody gon' give you shit
I learned that niggas gon be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it
But hoes gon' be hoes, they just ain't admitting to it
Where I been? Gettin to it, goin' through and gettin' through it
Running round killin' shit and tellin' cops, ""I didn't do it""
That's why they call me ""Young OG""
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chillin' in my city but my lungs OT, yeah
And fuck them niggas online, reply why
Broke niggas talkin', cause it's free wifi

Troubled tears, they'll land you there
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel, is not real, not real
The fear that you feel, is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do

My son gon' be a king, I tell him every morning
I put my chain on his neck, right now it's heavy on him
One day it'll all be his, so I'm forever on him
I test him all the time and I never warn him
I pop quiz him like stop listenin' and drop wiz em
Pops vision; the bottoms crowded, the top isn't
We talk guap missions, cops prison
I help him see it clearly, I'm his life optician
Could learn from my experience but youngin' gotta live
Not with that mentality, that something gotta give
Cause that how we grew up, probably should of picked for boogers
Nah we was on them streets, juggin for that mugger
Still, scared that you could get killed
That fear that you feel, was that real
But I'm there like, I will not get killed
So that fear that I feel, is not real boy
I'ma true King, tryna raise a new king
I wanna show him stuff , how to do things
How to ride a bike, how to tie shoe strings
How to be a man, how to treat his boo thing
Gotta have a OG, to give you that ""Go 'head""
I don't blame you niggas, I blame your old head
I know all about that, my Poppa wasn't down
Poppa used to come through, Poppa doesn't now
Shoulda' protected me, but Poppa wasn't 'round
So now I got this 9, that pop-a-dozen round
Them kids grow up quick, usually grow you up too
Turn you to a big dog, that's what having pups do
Did a lot, but I know I ain't done yet
Before it goes down, I make sure that my son set
You made so strong, you made this whole song
You made me Young OG, love you Johan

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be..

Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held

Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be..
Gang related! in and out tha penitentiary
With no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree

Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets
Then you might be..
Gang related! (aint nothin' wrong)

Did your crew's name originate in illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like violent j

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free

Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?
If you do that's okay, fuck we all do

Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio

I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery

The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'Cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

Traveling miles and miles from home 
Blood still stains the ground we walked 
Soaking into the roots of trees 
Giving strength to mother earth 
This land is not their land 
Head held high above the torment 
Tousands die in wars 
Murdered, killed, and slaughtered 
Hear the hearts of our lost warriors 
Beating to the pounding drum 
This ground was once ours 
Now a wasteland of destruction 
Polluting the waters we drink 
Polluting the air we breathe 
Forced in the corner suffocating 
Outcasts grouping for the next to ride 
Through a smoke filled remonition 
Tellers of the future speaking of the new beginning 
One warrior will rise to defend against this place

Come to none of my shows, or buy none of my tapes
Cause who the hell should I support, I'ma still be straight
The less niggaz around me, the better I can concentrate
When I came face straight, or open up my chest plate

I be a loner on my own, alone hang with my chrome
These motherfuckers play, life so fraud
I peep game, to the T
Cause I don't want nobody, to catch a nigga slipping on the Boulevard
And on the other hand, just to make matters worse
I feel, they want me headed to the grave
And I ain't ready to leave, I got my back planted against the wall
With a nine, about to misbehave
Same old shit, with a friend or a foe
Pack your shit, and get the fuck out the do'
Ain't no way, you hoes finna be a part of my life

You can try what you wanna, but I ain't gon fail
Look at me now, and all the shit that I sell
I'ma beat a nigga trunk off, coast to coast
And everybody who doubt that, can go to hell
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
And I don't give a fuck, cause I'm in my zone
All that hate you got, it only make a nigga strong

You must of thought I forgot, when I was stuck on the block
And I was broke, everybody laughed a lot
And now the tables have turned, you niggaz fraud
And you know see Trae, with his foot up on the gas a lot
Cause I don't trust you niggaz
Give me fifty feet, 'fore I rush you niggaz
Move it around, cause I don't fuck with you niggaz
To tell the truth, I'm allergic to you niggaz
Asshole for life, until a nigga fly
Nigga don't stop, better go on pass by
And hoes, don't call my cellular phone
The only thing, that y'all know how to do is lie

Why y'all niggaz wanna rob wanna steal, that ain't real
How the fuck I'ma kick it with you, you ain't gon get me killed
I done seen a lot of blood, on the battlefield
Even though I'm tired, I be climbing up the ladder still
Ain't nobody words gon hurt me, even if they dessert me
I'ma still be grubbing, and drink a drink when I'm thirsty
Just to be in my position, motherfuckers ain't worthy
So they feminine conversations, don't even disturb me
I'm a gangsta, don't need another nigga to grade me
If I'm in trouble, don't need nobody to save me
Steady losing composure, like my kon folk Trae be
I'ma handle my bidness, ain't nobody else made me

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine

When you cross yo'best bet is to back back
Mo City, Texas will open up yo back
Where the killers get killed and the jackers get jacked
I use to smoke sherm and sip that drank mayne
Get stuck at the intersection and watch the light change
Ostrich interior, hand full of wood grain
Big body sittin wide enough to take up both lanes

Pants sittin low with a rag or a dobb
Pistol on my waist to keep drama from gettin' hard
When I ride one of these six whips out the yard
It ain't no tellin' how many niggas I writes off
I got goons in the trap for the right cost
I watch you leap out then I take a nice loss
I play it raw and I ain't leavin till ya lights off
Fresh Coogi when I walk with the price off
I'm still a million dollar nigga with the ice off

That I have not lived yet 

You and I, truth and lies 
I've been fooling myself too long 
You and I, breaking ties 
How could we be so right and so wrong?

I hear the words you say 
Your mouth against my skin 
My world just falls away 
You light me from within 

And even though I may return 
To empty places on my own 
Where I remember everything 
You want me to forget

And you provide a parachute 
When I am falling like a stone 
And I remember there's a life 
That I have not lived yet 

You and I, truth and lies 
I've been fooling myself too long 
You and I, breaking ties 
How could we be so right and so wrong?

Truth and lies
Breaking ties

You and I, truth and lies 
I've been fooling myself too long 
You and I, breaking ties

Above & Beyond,"Little bit lost and
A little bit lonely
Little bit cold here
A little bit feared

But I hold on
And I
Feel strong
And I
Know that I can

Getting used to it
Lit the fuse to it
Like to know who I am

Been talking to myself forever, yeah
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah
Still sitting on a shelf and never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day

And it feels like me
On a good day

Been talking to myself forever, yeah
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah
Still sitting on a shelf and never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day

On a good day
On a good day
And it feels like me
