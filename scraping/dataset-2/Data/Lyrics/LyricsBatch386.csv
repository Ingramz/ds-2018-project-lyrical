Iron & Wine,"Darling behave, though your boy is gone, or so we've heard
I feel you would rise if it was a song who'd say these words
Summer comes with its color all to take your breath away
Winter turns all the summer's love to gray

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Darling behave, though the barnyard won't say where he's gone
I feel you would sing if the orchard let on what went wrong
Summer comes, yeah, as loud as hope and takes your breath away
Winter takes what the summer had to say",Loud as Hope,2009
Iron & Wine,"Oh, I've just come from the land of the sun
From a war that must be won in the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades and some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child are waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe the joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave and I was going home
Oh, I flew through the sky, my convictions could not lie
For my country I would die, and I will see it soon

And I want to see my family
My wife and child are waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door my wife she lay upon the floor
And with tears her eyes did soar, I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand and I saw the telegram
Said that I was a brave, brave man, but that I was dead

I want to see my family
My wife and child are waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

I want to see my family
My wife and child are waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see",Love Vigilantes,2009
Iron & Wine,"Hard light, take the wings of the winter
Song bird, they were strong hands that held her
Miles above ground, we can't see you now

Morning took the reins from the rider
Strong hands on the lap behind her
They tear her nightgown, we can't see you now",Morning,2009
Iron & Wine,"Black dog bit through the keeper's chain
Small and angry when the Devil came
Sold my soul like a pocket knife
There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet

Tomcat curled on a rabbit cage
Brittle fingers in the potter's clay
Sold my soul and I laid her down
There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet

Blue bird laughs on a fallen tree
Sunset burns on a quiet sea
Sold my soul and they ran me down
There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet",No Moon,2009
Iron & Wine,"Curiosity was far greater than our fear
It felt so simple, so prodigious at the same time

Incredible things are happening in the world
Magical things are happening in this world

Across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments
While we really keep on living like monkeys

Incredible things are happening in the world
Magical things are happening in this world, yeah",Peng! 33,2009
Iron & Wine,"""There's no way to temper your thirst
With lasting' impressions or pictures of home
There's no way to grow that don't hurt""
She growled from the station then hung up the phone

There's no sacred vision like her
No eye-crushing mountain or jewelry to wear
There's no granted wish I prefer
Then she to be with me, for us to be there

""I'd rather to be all alone
Forgiveness is fickle when trust is a chore
It's not every sin that's atoned""
I heard her speak softly then heard her no more",Sacred Vision,2009
Iron & Wine,"There's a woman here with a broken record player
And a dusty compass off to map the country's new behavior
Strange words that we hold on back into the river
Brave boys in the empty coats of men

There's a kitchen timer, distractions and reminders
Rolly-pollies started crawling across your family's china
Strange words that we hold on back into the river
Dead dogs on the winter night again

There's a serpent charmer, pair of shoes and wander
Speeding ticket, you're not leaving that last land of slaughter
Strange words that we hold on back into the river
Good girls come and kick you in the shin

There's a hopeful hunter that has a sense of wonder
And leaving claw marks on the rock he hid his money under
Strange words that we hold on back into the river
And made men only want to live again",Serpent Charmer,2009
Iron & Wine,"Midnight, and her eyes
Hide like kittens, new and wet
Mine are sinning hands
On her lying on my bed

The river still may rise
Wild and water take us both
Mine are sinning hands
Take our bodies, take our clothes

Bloodless moonlight, may my lady
Give her lovely skin and bones

Midnight, and my bride
Treads in distant water now
Mine are sinning hands
And my teeth have fallen out

The river still may rise
Though it took more than it gave
Mine are sinning hands
On a broken windowpane

Bloodless moonlight, like my lady
Gave me only skin and bones",Sinning Hands,2009
Iron & Wine,"I asked you a question
But I didn't need you to reply
Is it getting heavy?
But then I realize
Is it getting heavy?
Well, I thought it was already as heavy as can be

Is it overwhelming
To use a crane to crush a fly?
It's a good time for Superman
To lift the sun into the sky
'Cause it's getting heavy
Hell I thought it was already as heavy as can be

Tell everybody waitin' for Superman
That they should try to hold on best they can
He hasn't dropped them, forgot them, or anything
It's just to heavy for Superman to lift

Is it getting heavy?
Hell I thought it was already as heavy as can be

Iron & Wine,"When the arrogant goddess of love came to steal my shoes
She had a white-hot pistol and a homemade heart tattoo
Singing, ""One's to give and one's to take away,
But neither of them will keep you off your knees""
Her children bowed and bolted off the stage
While the lion and the lamb kept fighting for the shade tree

When the winsome god of war came to set me free
He had a couple of Coke bottles full of gasoline
Singing, ""All I love is all that I allow""
And he blew me a kiss off a big burned hand
I nearly choked with smoke and fell down
While the lion and the lamb kept shooting at a tin can

When the gun-shy goddess of love came back to patch things up
She had a purple heart and mother's milk in a plastic cup
Singing, ""One to lay you gently in the grave,
And one's the flag you fold before you go""
When the curtain rose the crowd was blown away
While the lion and the lamb kept fucking in the back row",Big Burned Hand,2011
Iron & Wine,"Godless brother in love
You might as well
Lay down that rose
And fold the flag

She is money and tabs
That broken freedom in
See her big children burning rags
By the riverside

You can hear them on the hilltop laughing
Cursing every bird in the air
Telling her what fun they're having
Driving eyes closed

Godless brother
As far as I can tell
The night won't compensate the blight

She looks lovely
As lightning all
But what the hell

Her big kids all run down the road
With no memories at all

And you can hear them on the hilltop laughing
Cursing every bird in the air
Telling her what fun they're having
Driving eyes closed",Brother in Love,2011
Iron & Wine,"I've become a glad man singing a song
About a soldier wanting food and fallen angel
Naked as a fish at night
About a sad man climbed up a willow bough
And the cops are on the fence around the dog in the manger
And the mouth of the river is wide
Wide 

I've become a glad man singing a song
About the bushes by the gas pump gone to flower
And a constant star collides
About a sad man singing they forgotten how
And the baby quick sucking when the milk went sour
And the mouth of the river is wide
Wide 

About a sad man lost in the hammock sway
When the bridal gown came on and spit out the window
And the cops say the dog won't bite
And the sad man's saying they've forgotten how
And the blood running black in the valley shadows
And the river running all the while

I've become a glad man singing a song
About a lover rolled over, said you must be tired
And the truth coming towards the light
About a sad man knocking on a chapel door
And a burned out boat called ""Tried by Fire""
And the mouth of the river is wide
Wide",Glad Man Singing,2011
Iron & Wine,"Halfway home in the hilltop trees
And all our footprints in the snow
And the evening glow, leaving

Low night noise in the winter time
I wake besides you on the floor
Counting your breathing

I can't see nothing in this half moon
Lay me down if I should lose you

Halfway working on a worn out house
And all our friends, the ragged clothes
The naked bones, whining

Where are we when the twilight comes?
The darker valley and the breeze
And the frozen leaves, chiming

Because I can't see nothing in this half moon
Lay me down if I should lose you",Half Moon,2011
Iron & Wine,"Me and Lazarus, we shovel all the ashes out
Black bare linens blowing 'round
Back and forth and up and down

Oh, oh, whoa
Guess I had nowhere else to go

Me and Lazarus kept bailing on that riverboat
Floating by the choir rose
Bobbing in the ebb and flow

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Guess I had nowhere else to go

He's an emancipated punk and he can dance
But he's got a hole in the pocket of his pants
Must be a symptom of outstanding circumstances

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Me and Lazarus, we fiddle with a baby spoon
Fever flowing through the room
Far too long and way too soon

Oh, whoa, whoa
Guess I had nowhere else to go

Me and Lazarus, we pick up papa's white boy blues
Hand-me-downs and Sunday shoes
Never made the local news

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Guess I had nowhere else to go

And I'm a liberated loser that can roam
But where my pocket was I'm peeking through a hole
A couple second chances surely would console me

Whoa, whoa, whoa",Me and Lazarus,2011
Iron & Wine,"I knew you well, I know you best
A baby mouth and I the breast
A lazy bone, an eagle eye
Circling a city that's higher than the sky

And it's looking like you better do what they say
Those monkeys uptown, I told you not to fuck around
Heaven's the name and the river is brown
With all the mud and the rain, it never settles down
It never settles down

Your baby left you unimpressed
But no one likes a beggar slightly overdressed
Trouble comes in funky clothes
You can always find a razor lying in the road

And it's looking like you better do what they say
Those monkeys uptown, I told you not to fuck around
Heaven's the name and the river is brown
With all the mud and the rain, it never settles down
It never settles down

I knew you well, I know you best
Everybody owes something to everybody else
Gabriel gave me some news to give to you
Maybe taken for granted, you've nothing better to do

And it's looking like you better do what they say
Those monkeys uptown, I told you not to fuck around

With all the mud and the rain, it never settles down
It never settles down",Monkeys Uptown,2011
Iron & Wine,"Last I saw mother, she rose from her chair
When they caught me I'd just finished combing my hair
'Cause a rabbit will run, and the colt hasn't long with the mare

We've all learned the earth while we've carried the throne
We dove under the rivers and under our clothes
And I still have a prayer, as sure as my settling bones

Last I saw mother, she covered my ears
When they caught me I offered the captain a beer
'Cause the rabbit will run, and the lion has nothing to fear

We bricked up the garden and know what it means
And we've all kissed a virgin as if she were clean
And I still have a prayer, despite all the colors I've seen

And judgment is just like a cup that we share
I'll jump over the wall and I'll wait for you there
Well past the weeds in our vision of things to come

We've all heard the rooster and all been denied
And we've seen through the haze and the spit in our eyes
And I still have a prayer, a well-weathered word to the wise

Last I saw mother, she smelled like a rose
When they caught me, the captain, he opened my nose
'Cause the rabbit will run, and the wind takes a bird where it blows

We've all traded lovers and woke up alone
And we've clapped for the king though our fingers were cold
And I still have a prayer 'cause I love what I cannot control

Last I saw mother, she acted surprised
When they caught me, the captain, he cried like a child
Because the rabbit will run, good dogs together go wild

We've all lived in grace at the end of the day
And we've armed all the children we thought we betrayed
And I still have a prayer, but too few occasions to pray

And judgment is just like a cup that we share
I'll jump over the wall and I'll wait for you there
Well past the weeds in our vision of things to come

And we've all found a reason for hiding a gun
And we've helped out a few if we've hurt anyone
And I still have a prayer, and so be it, I've done what I've done

Last I saw mother, she blew me a kiss
When they caught me, the cuffs cut the blood from my wrist
'Cause the rabbit will run and the pig has to lay in it's piss

We've all given half to the hand in our face
We've all taken a stone from the holiest place
And I still have a prayer, and I've furthered the world in my wait",Rabbit Will Run,2011
Iron & Wine,"Mary Anne, do you remember
The tree by the river
When we were seventeen?

Dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
And the mare in the pasture
Pitch black and baring its teeth.

I recall the sun in our faces,
Stuck and leaning on braces,
And being strangers to change.

Radio and the bones we found frozen,
And all the thorns and the roses
Beneath your window pane.

Now I'm asleep in a car, I mean the world?
To a potty-mouth girl,
A pretty pair of blue-eyed birds.

Time isn't kind or unkind, you liked to say.
But I wonder to who
What it is you're saying today.

Now I'm asleep in a car, I mean the world

The tree by the river

Dark canyon road, I was coy in the half-moon
Happy just to be with you,
And you were happy for me.",Tree by the River,2011
Iron & Wine,"I was walking far from home
Where the names were not burned along the wall
Sour building high as heaven
But the door was so small, door was so small

I saw rainclouds, little babies
And a bridge that had tumbled to the ground
I saw sinners making music
And I dreamt of that sound, dreamt of that sound

I was walking far from home
But I carried your letters all the while
I saw lovers in a window
Whisper, ""Warn me like time, warn me like time""

I saw sickness blooming fruit trees
I saw blood and a bit of it was mine
I saw children in a river
But their lips were still dry, lips were still dry

I was walking far from home
And I found your face mingled in the crowd
Saw a boat full of believers
Say, ""I'm talking too loud, talking too loud""

I saw sunlight on the water
Saw a bird fall like a hammer from the sky
And a woman on a speed train
She was closing her eyes, closing her eyes

I saw flowers on a hillside
And a millionaire pissing on the lawn
Saw a prisoner take a pistol
And say, ""Join me in song, join me in song""

Saw a car crash in the country
Where the prayers are like weeds along the road
I saw strangers stealing kisses
Giving only their clothes, only their clothes

Saw a white dog chase its tail
And a pair of hearts carved into a stone
I saw kindness and an angel
Crying, ""Take me back home, take me back home""

Saw a highway, saw an ocean
I saw widows in the temple to the Lord
Naked dancers in the city
How they spoke for us all, spoke for us all

I saw loaded linen tables
And a motherless colt and it was gone
I saw hungry brothers waiting
With a radio on, radio on

I was walking far from home
Where the names are not burned along the wall
Saw a wet road form a circle
And it came like a call, came like a call

From the Lord",Walking Far from Home,2011
Iron & Wine,"Fake watches in your broken hand
Barely keeping time
Barefoot in the city and your phone is ringing

Diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
And when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map
And called for you everywhere

Have I found you?
Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big pill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat
Cursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean

Iron & Wine,"Mama called you baby center stage,
She could really run her mouth.
Baton Rouge called you petit angel
And Birmingham had run you out.

Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time I was running you down
But the world kept spinning round
Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time when you were running to me
But the lightning spared the tall tree

When your moon lights up the riverside
Making mud and bad blood
You can call me anytime
For all it’s worth, Louisiana’s still not enough.

In your restless days
I got lost, I got saved
In your restless nights
I swam blind
Somehow falling into the light

Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time I was running you down
But the world kept spinning round
Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time when you were running to me
But the hurricane had mercy

In your restless days
All that wind, all those waves
In your restless nights
We closed our eyes
Killed each other and came to life

In your restless days
I made my bed, I dug my grave
In your restless nights
We both swam blind
Somehow falling into the light",Baby Center Stage,2013
Iron & Wine,"Back alleys full of rain
And everything shining
As holy as she can be
The trick’s in the timing

Free as a morning bird,
Fragile as china,
She’s stuck in the weakest heart
Of South Carolina

Where all of the naked boys
Lay down beside her,
Sing her the saddest song
All caught in the briars

I never meant to fall
So hard in the doorway
And all the sinners here
Have crosses for Sunday

Kissed at the county fair,
Frisked in the city,
Which proves as an answered prayer
But ain’t it a pity

That all of the naked boys
That laid down beside her
Sing her the saddest song
All caught in the briars",Caught in the Briars,2013
Iron & Wine,"As new as he, California’s gonna kill you soon
A bus with boys, but calls in the shadow of the moon
Black houses in the hills and road side hearts
Dying for a place to fall apart

Who knew that you can learn to live without?
Mother Mary’s laying in your mouth now
Big home to catch his warm with grace must whine
Never think this girl is nice to grown

You left a look for him, but you’re far
from the heart like tonight

So quietly we’re lost and were here
The desert put a babbler in your ear
Mean fight away and not miss you again
Boston boys are speeding to the wind now

Back home a hammer always has to fall
Crosses barely hanging on the wall.
Someday I know you’ll never leave me
But we’re far from the heart like tonight",The Desert Babbler,2013
Iron & Wine,"But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I

There were banged up hands stealing first base
Underneath the tables so we never sang grace
Falling out of bed for the workday week
There was kissing in the cracks of the flash flood streets
There were button blossoms and merry Johnny Rotten
Chewed up and swallowed by the profit they were trying to follow
Bit too green and we paid no tax on our quick romantic cul de sac

But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I

There were washed out cars in our bark-old clothes
They were rubbing on each other rubbing ghost on ghost
There were jonesed-up punks and Jesus freaks
Weaving in and out of trouble wrapping round and round a leash
There were sleepless dreamers, blues day preachers
The message and the messenger, gum beneath the register
The sweet gum tree by the dug dunk tank
We could never give enough to the bad-luck bank
There were hopeless sinners, sweepstake winners
They danced with the farmer’s daughter, capered with the corporate lawyers

But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I

There was laughing in the night, sugar in the shade
There were back stab handshakes made on faith
We were never out of time and we never entertained
Anybody said out of habit that the wind was going to change
There were restless misfits, teething biscuits
Bodies full of penny wishes, parties full of pretty dishes
Side by side with the birds and bees
And we never sang grace and never ever took a knee
With the saints and ramblers, movie star handlers
High above the aviary, underneath the cemetery
And we never wondered why, 'cause the sun was in our eyes
There was seed for the field, there was grease for the wheel
We were drinking with the luminaries, eating with the visionaries

But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I
But it all came down to you and I",Grace for Saints and Ramblers,2013
Iron & Wine,"We found each other blown between the trees
Where the moons want me to be swallowed by the sea
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
We grew the garden snake within the weeds
Laid each other long across a flat back street
Like we finally saw the colors of the world

We felt the sun leave us for the west
And the lips always folding farther from the breast
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
We ran a white flag up the mast
Puckered up like a widow gleaming in the grass
Like we finally saw the colors of the world

Like we saw black, like we saw black and blue
You placed up in the foolish snow up, cover loose
Like we saw black, like we saw brow, green, too
You saw an often but it’s over too soon

Like we saw black, running a million times
I found you in the fundamental with the mind
Like we saw black, lying in gold and white
I love this song and till you love me all night

We threw our money to the river stones
Led each other to the woods to wander back alone
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
We let the taste linger in the mouth
South Chicago never gave us more to sing about
Like we finally saw the colors of the world",Grass Widows,2013
Iron & Wine,"Deep inside the heart of this troubled man
There’s innie binnie boy talking hard at your hand
Born bitter as a lemon, but you must understand
That you’ve been bringing me joy

And now in lie, no, you don’t want the truth
I’m only fighting cause you finally gave me something to lose
And it’s as loud as a thunder cloud and you will, too
But you’ve been bringing me joy

Deep inside the heart of this crazy mess
I’m only calm when I get lost within your well darkness
Born crooken as a creek now you’ve come to contest
That you’ve been bringing me joy

When I’ve been blue but dying got me singing the blues
And it’s a hard up silly song and bumbling tune
But now you’re bringing me joy",Joy,2013
Iron & Wine,"I came to you, and you to me
And we were tapping on the window of the children when the piggy-bank broke
Pitching quite a fifth
But how the makers of the medicine will always say you're looking sick

I came to you, and you to me
And we would wear up to the women washing in the form of white gloves
But the funny thing was how in in god and
His people were dreaming about the wilds to leave
And all the fingers that we damaged when all we wanted was a diamond ring

I came to you (I came to you) , and you to me (and you to me)
And we were barking at the drug dogs, blood-dried-black on their hands
Never realized,
You never tussle with a giant till you can hit him right between the eyes
That no matter how we chose 'em we'll be chocking on the compromised
'Cause all the jaws, all the claws, they're restless by the riverside
And it was a muscle and a shadow that was shoving us into the light

I came to you, and you to me
And we were snatching out a poor baby's bottle just to trade it for change
But now it's come to pass
The every eye beneath the mountains saw the smoke and no one heard the blast
And no one knew the arm was broken, tho everybody signed the cast
Until the compliment was good she said man I thought you'd never ask
And when the world wore out their welcome they just booked up for a bag of grass
But when she cried on the grounds we were sucking all the laughing gas
And when the hat had left the body not a flag was hanging on us

I came to you, and you to me
And then we lost our own lovers revolution but then it all started again
Now we're one

One of the parade wailing widows walking home into the setting sun
One of the soldiers lost, and then dreams and never lose their gun
One of the wise-men wondered onto the podium without a tongue
One of the trophies' corners by the mess we made of being young
One of the wrayers, one of the promises swallowed without chewing gum
One of the deaf ear's dumber all of the time for all the years of drums
One of the wide-eyed soap boxes buried under washing time
One of the bee-cops combing every sidewalk-crack for love
One of the crowded stars uncounted when the math was done
One of the weather in the garden left to wonder when the rain will come",Lovers' Revolution,2013

He can rattle his bell in shining shoe
And never in doubt where I found you

I love you and you love me,
So we don't get back and we don't say please

I love you and you love me

On every green road sign
When you left Santa Fe.

We were two string beans
And you were too 19
To be blowing away

There were thieves in the square
Hiding hands and hiding prayers
And all their mumbling

Now they left you alone
Tangled heels and tiny veery oh's
Singing something

Stuck with open curls
Your mama was scared of the world,
It was born with a bang

I was stepping on sea shells
By the old Mission San Miguel
When a bell tower rang

And the sky fell apart
Heard the rain, I heard your heart
And what was spoken.

Cause nothing bends for a name
Nothing wants to stay the same
And nothing's broken

When your friends and their friends
Pass the pipe or tie the knot
Honeymoon music played
In the drive-thru parking lot

I woke up by your bed
You were wandering around the yard
Window wide as a day
But the sun just hit too hard

In a home void of doors
Mama's house slowed a little more
In the evening.

Naked boys throwing stones
Beady eyes and desert bones
They saw you leaving.

And the good kind of black night

About the hurting and the healing hand, the hand

Iron Maiden,"Giving a swish with your ass in the air, don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?

[Chorus]
Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs,
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed.
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood,
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love.

Taking so many men to your room, don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a ""fiver"", It's only for starters.
And ten for the main course.
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago.
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving.

[Chorus]

There was a time when you left me standing there,
Picking up pieces of love off the floor.
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there,
To make your ends as a bloody whore.
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true,
Picking up pieces of love yesterday.
Well Charlotte you're draws are off color too
'Cause you're making love all day.

Giving a swish with your ass in the air, don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.

Let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place

Oh

Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world

Can't you see it only brings you sadness
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease

In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat.

He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars

The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe yes
They'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be the
Best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
And he'll make a stand
Against evil and fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end",To Tame a Land,1983
Iron Maiden,"Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me

Oh, I've never felt so strange
But, I'm not going insane

I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do

Oh, they drain my strength away
Oh, they're asking me to stay

Nightmares, spirits calling me
Nightmares, they won't leave me be

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool

Now, I feel they are so near
I, begin to see them clear

Nightmares, coming all the time
Nightmares, Will give me peace of mind

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too

Oh, we'll drown together
It, will be forever

Nightmares, forever calling me
Nightmares, Now we rest in peace",Still Life,1983

And who would steal the candy
From a laughing baby's mouth 
If he could take it from the money man

She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
And the jack-knife barber, drops her off at school

Would rather make it with a letching grey
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung 
Who watches through the railings as they play
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along
She's a poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song

You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.
Times change very quickly,
and you had to grow up early,
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner forgotten by no one.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honor.

The smell of resigned leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.
He taught you all he knew
To fear no mortal man
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.

In a flash of the blade,
In a corner forgotten by no one.

Iron Maiden,"Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me
It is so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain impending disaster
Souls crying the devil's laughter
Heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles looks on and waits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see
What will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

Purgatory beckons souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fate their fortunes in my visions
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late",The Prophecy,1988
Iron Maiden,"""Woe to you, oh Earth and sea, for the Devil sends the Beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast 
For it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty six""

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course",Number of the Beast [Live],1990
Iron Maiden,"In the heat of the morning
When your day is still dawning
And your bird, she's singing
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away

Packed your bags in a hurry
Because your mind's in a worry
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away

Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me

'Cause I'm so tired
Yes I'm so tired
So tired
Yes I'm so tired

'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something?
I mean it would be so cool
If you were in a band 'cause you're

Medieval nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems
Black Bart's lookin'
Don't know where she's been
Maybe she's an acrobat
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Black Bart tried most anything
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
So he asked me to tell ya
Try it for yourself and you will see
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

'What did you do that for?'
'I'm sorry, I just, I guess I'm not used to...
'Shut up and get on with it will you'

Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow
So if you are a dancer,
You could dance his pole in May
That's a maypole

Black Bart's coming
Now Black Bart's gone
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song
Whatever and however,
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!
We all got to do the Black Bart blues
Here comes the guitar solo

We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Iron Maiden,"At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo

Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion

There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but doesn't care though
In fact, he doesn't care at all

The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear

If God is in the heavens
How can this happen here?

A hound of hell and the devil don't care

In open ocean wondering when?

Obeying an order-men have to die

The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed

Iron Maiden,"""O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride.""
(G. K. Chesterton  English Hymnal)

Just a babe in the black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in the black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.

The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.

And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring,
It is You
It is You",Revelations,1991
Iron Maiden,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through  the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

""Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""

There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
BUt how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.

Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then, crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

""One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan)
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one.""

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

and by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in  falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
spirits go fromhe long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.",Rime of the Ancient Mariner,1991

Waiting for the mist to cover all around

The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again

And the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

Forever looking back

Will lay ahead

Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's
To be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done, on earth

Reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

No other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Iron Maiden,"Now I'm here can you see me
'cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me
You can feel me
Cause I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my
Dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'cause you can count your
Real true friends on one hand

Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you
Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
Right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what
Happens when we die
Wouldn't it?
There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must
Have lived before
Don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an
Open and shut case

Extrasensory Perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through
Space and time?

You know I feel so elated
'cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your ""friends""
Might say
We'll meet up again someplace

She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more, more, more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
""I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity""

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were, two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place

Iron Maiden,"Can't understand what is happening to me,
This isn't real, this is only a dream,
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before,
I'm looking down on my body below,
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe,
'Cause I've no fear of dying,
I'll go when I'm good and ready,
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.

Oh oh lots.

My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.",Heaven Can Wait,1993

Iron Maiden,"Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes

I wonder why I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker

That as soon as you're born you're dying

Iron Maiden,"As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill,
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream,
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.

Iron Maiden,"Infinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will I transcend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
Getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

Even though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Help me, help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

There's got to be
More to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist

I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again

Do you think you can have peace of mind 
And have self-belief or be satisfied 

Do you think you even like yourself 
Or really think you could be someone else 
Is there something that you'd rather be 
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see 

All my life I've run away 
All my life I've tried to hide away 

Fell the paranoia creeping in 
Like a cancer eating at the skin 
Do you feel you've lost your self esteem 
And your self respect, what can you expect 

All my life, I've run astray 
Let my faith, slip away 
All my life, I've run astray 
Allowed my faith, to drift away 

Are you scared to look inside your mind 
Are you worried just at what you'll find 
Do you really want to face the truth 
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose 

Try to release the anger from within 
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins 
Do you really care what people think 
Are you strong enough to release the guilt",The Unbeliever,1995

Iron Maiden,"There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray

When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies

And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives

All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds

Iron Maiden,"A light in the black
Or just a fear of the dark

I am a man who walks alone
When I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to fade
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, you, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?

And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near

You sense and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course",Number of the Beast,1999
Iron Maiden,"Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.

[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a power slave
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the power of death.

When I was living this lie-fear was my game
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.

[Chorus]

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in  my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.

[Chorus]",Powerslave,1999
Iron Maiden,"You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back

The bugle sounds as the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As you plunge into a certain death

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And as the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh",The Trooper,1999
Iron Maiden,"I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding and hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

standing in the wings there you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way

I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the phantom of the opera you're the devil, you're just out to scare

You haunt me, you taunt me you torture me back at your lair",Phantom of the Opera,1999
Iron Maiden,"And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

Iron Maiden,"Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost

Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Running back down the line

It'll be tell me why

If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each others heads
Would we all be driven mad
Would we all be dead

By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all step closer to our death

Another let off madman
Another screw on the loose
Is it the judge or the badman?

Nobody has any faith
'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order

When I remember back the memories of yesteryear (they really say ""yesterday"")
With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree
And walking down the street
When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses' doors were open
No had to care; those days are gone
Those days are gone

I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When people didn't have much money

With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.

Run before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last there's someone heard my call

I never done nothing at all
But I must have got some blood on my hands
Because everybody's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away
And now I've got to get away from the ares of the law

I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down south to Italy

Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me

Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast 
For it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty six""

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released4

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

Rust your bullets with his tears 
Let me tell you 'bout his years

In the smoke in the mud and lead 
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread 
Soon be time to go over the wall

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire 
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire 
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb 
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Drown in mud no more tears 
Surely a war no-one can win 
Killing time about to begin 

Home, far away 
From the war, a chance to live again 
Home, far away 
But the war, no chance to live again 

The bodies of ours and our foes 
The sea of death it overflows 
In no man's kand god only knows 
Into jaws of death we go

Allied troops they mourn their loss 
German war propaganda machine 
Such before has never been seen

Everyman does play his part 
Terror of the men we kill

Nervous wait for the whistle to blow 
Rush of blood and over we go 

Blood is falling like the rain 
It's crimson cloak unveils again 
The sound of guns can't hid their shame 
And so we die on Paschendale 

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire 
Running straight at the cannon fire 
Running blind as I hold my breath 
Say a prayer symphony of death 

As we charge the enemy lines 
A burst of fire and we go down 
I choke a cry but no-one hears 
Fell the blood go down my throat 

Home, far away 
From the war, a chance to live again 
Home, far away

And all the politicians and their hollow promises 
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it 
The working man pays everything for their mistakes 
And with his life too if there was to be a war

So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only got one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday 
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday 
Assailants know just how much further they can go 
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home 
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes 
So now the criminal they launch right in our face 
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace 

Despondent public worries, where it will all end?
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend 
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst 
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
Drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 

To this day I guess I'll never know 
Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more

Everybody's waiting for something to see 
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters 
Everyone's waiting for news on TV 

Winding lives at the end of the spiral 
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill 
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening 
Everybody wants to be in at the kill 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end of time 

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing 
Everyone's looking for the reason why 
Everyone's hoping for life everafter 
Everyone's looking at death from the sky 

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen 
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes 
Everyone's praying but no one's believing 
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies

I see the signs of the end

Iron Maiden,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace

Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals

And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body

But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

You know you'll be prepared for it

Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood filled trench
Kill tim 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Fell the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again

But the war, no chance to live again

He gave his life for us
He fell upon the cross
To die for all of those
Who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us
To feel the pain again
Tell me why, tell me why",For the Greater Good of God,2006
Iron Maiden,"Tell you a thing that you ought to know
Two minutes of your time, then on you go
Tell tale of the men all dressed in black
That most of them, not coming back
Sent off to war to play little games
And on their return, can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
How many get well?
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table?
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools?
And to think that we thought you the answer

I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed, I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense, I can see it clearly now

Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome

You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along, your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now?
Only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to Hell as well

Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least
Take the world to better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy you now will leave

We seemed destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, while there's hope
That man won't self-destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands?
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
""Fight fire with fire, life is cheap""
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care?
They benefit from death and pain and despair",The Legacy,2006
Iron Maiden,"In the gloom the gathering storm abates
In the ships gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate

All summers long the drills to build the machine
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach

Overlord, your master not your god
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who sent them here

The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death enter hell's gate

Sliding we go, only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire,
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red,
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through

The rising dead, faces bloated torn
They are relieved, the living wait their turn
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name
You still go on, to hell and back again

Valhalla waits, valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil
Blood and sand, we will prevail

Sliding we go, only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire,
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red,
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

There are secrets that you keep

Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal

These are things you can't reveal

We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man
Infernal sacrifice of hell

Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one

Down into the fiery underworld below

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me

We are not worthy in your black
And blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a
Shadow on us all
And all our sins to you we give this day

Others wait their turn
Their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us

We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

Out of the Shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Dusty dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you

Out of the Shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

And as we race towards human wall

And as the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Beast of burden,
Moving up along the mountainside,
As he gazes looking down the
Valley,
No regrets but his pride.

As he journeys across
Mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him.
His reflection of the beauty
Round him.
Feeling empty inside.

He is running from his
Wildest thoughts.
He is running from his everything.
He is looking now to
Find something,
Hoping he could be saved.

He's searching for the answer now.
It's something that he's managed to
Avoid up 'til now.
Real conviction, that he craves.
He needs to find the answer
Sooner than later.

Pushed himself to the limits.
He had to strive for all the harder
Things in life,
But what the cost of giving now?
His life and his time are the only things
That he has.

Life is is not a rehearsal.
All he has is the one chance
To get it right.
Leaving really is the only
Way to know.

Maybe one day they'll forgive him
What he's done,
But now the pain of lying too
Early in the grave.

Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving

With God.
All is forgivable but it's left
A little late.
Trying something that he's not.
Is it possible to change such a lot?

He's taken someone's life away.
There's not a day goes by.
He regrets what he's done.
He should have found another way
But the good book says:
An eye for an eye.

In reflecting on decisions
That were made.
On the judgments that will
Haunt him 'til his grave.
No one has the right to
Take another life
But in his mind he had no choice.
So be it.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving

Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes

Looked into the abyss, called it by its name

I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this is my house
I am the master of the tides, I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres across the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore, my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this was my house
I was the keeper of the books, I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear, I cast a shadow through the years

Know this, I will return to this land

Chain up the demons set free

Oh the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Curving on the edge of daylight 'til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night, dreaming 'til the sun is born again
Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
Through the dark Atlantic; over mariners stormy graves

Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny

The one that brings me closer to the isle of Avalon

Getting ready to begin again.
Wounded, lying, crying bodies moving, dying.
All around there is the smell of death and fire.
Hear, the planes are coming.
Hear the soldiers running.
Killing on a scale to comprehend.

Why are we here in this place, here to kill?
Please, God, forgive us for what we have done.

I always thought I was doing right.
As of now, I'm not feeling so sure.
I'm at a place of wear, I give no grace.
I'm a soldier of war.

I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come.
I cannot think of about the things that I have done.
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe.
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done.

You tell me what is certain but I'll tell you what is true.
You tell me what is honesty when all around is death and cruelty.
I'm making out, my mind is vile, I'm giving in to our desires.
Within the truth that lies within the only thing.

Mother of mercy, angel of death, desire.
Mother of mercy taking my last breath, the fire.
Mother of mercy, angel of pain.
Mother of mercy taking my last breath.

Some say you are a lost cause, some say you're a saint.
Just being here's tonight, just suffering and restraint.
Walked down a long dark road to ruin, panic not.
I'll die a lonely death of that I'm certain of.

Rivers flow with blood, there's nowhere left to hide.
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive.
Sick of all that killing and the weak of death.
Well, God, tell me what religion is to man.

I don't hold with bad religion, understand what's underneath it.
Now I've come to think of it, I just don't hold out, all you know it.
You say you are a holy man but what is it you do.
Of where I stand there's nothing, but a hollow man I see.

Mother of mercy taking my last breath, the fire.
Mother of mercy, angel of pain.

Mother of mercy, angel of death, desire.
Mother of mercy taking my last breath, the fire.
Mother of mercy, angel of pain.
Mother of mercy, drawing my last breath.

I'm just a lonely soldier fighting in a bloody hopeless war.

In this world coming to an end.
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin.

You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have
No mortal face.

You may hear me call.

Into the darkened void beyond.

Iron Maiden,"When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life, will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck, I take my things and walk
To the harbor side I glance back one last time
Fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide

We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee
Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not, what is will be

We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
We run from the evil tongues, rash judgments, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size and lose sight of land
A face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no one going back, no, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side, we pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas, as we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives and pray that I survive
Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews, their phantoms follow us

Spirits, sails, they drive us on through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds out soar the raging storm but we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives and we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigued, trembling with cold, blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold, heaven's rain upon us falls
Twenty days without a meal and ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms, the scurvy rest did slaughter

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

We approach the other side of the ocean with the tide
In our favor just for once, welcome greeting, our new land
The elation in our hearts, the excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away, I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing left to give, must find the will to live
Never thought that we could make it, truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from, never wanted it to end this way

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman
Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

Iron Maiden,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
Drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 

To this day I guess I'll never know 
Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more

Iron Maiden,"When I stand and look
About the port
And contemplate my life, will I
Ever see my countrymen again?
As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk
To the harbourside, I glance back
One last time.

Fleeing our nation, our problems
We leave behind.
Ships by the tenfold sail
Out on the tide.
We are pleased to be out and
Embracing the open sea.
Free from our troubles
And more free from thee.

Inheritors unfulfilled reason
Behind us.
We flee from what is not what
Is will be.
We flee the earth and face our
Harsh reality.
Will death be low mist that
Hangs on the sea?

We run from evil tongues, rash
Judgements, selfish men.
Never to be seen on these
Shores again.

As we sail into oceansize
And lose sight of land
A face of contentment
Around in the air.
We're off now to
Seek all our fortunes.
To the land of our dreams.

Riding the waves and the storm
Is upon us.
The winds lash the sails but
The ropes keep them tight.
Off in the distance a dark cloud
Approaching.
None could imagine what there
Was to come.
No, there's no one going back.
No, there's not a second chance.
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we don't die.

As we ride the rough seas,
As we soak from the ocean waves,
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive.

Four ships are lost in the
Stormy conditions.

The spirits of the sunken crews,
Their phantoms follow us.

Spirits, sails, they drive us on
Through the all-consuming waves.
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas.

Four leagues and ten and we
Hit storms again.
We just can't get away from
The eye of the storm.

The birds outsoar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it.
Abandoned earth that we
Now crave
Is many leagues from safe.

Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again.
Rotten luck or just Jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand.

Limbs fatigued, trembling with cold.
Blinded from the sea spray salt.
Clasping anything we can hold.
Heaven's rain upon us falls.

Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still.
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter.

Westward the tide.
Westward we sail on.
Westward the tide.
Sail by the talisman.

We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favour just for once.
Welcome greeting, our new land.
The elation in our hearts,
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land.

Weary limbs fatigued away.
I have no life left in me.
No more strength and nothing
Left to give.
Must find the will to live.

Never thought that we could
Make it.
Truly sight of shores divine.
The sickness I am dying from.
Never wanted it to end this way.

To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to full fill man’s desire

And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown

Hanging at the mast, waiting for command

She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies

Drum rolled tight, a canvas skin, silvered in the sun

We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for the politicians he can't be late

Reaper standing beside you
Wind inside cuts to the bone
Panicked to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves

The cover is ripped and she's flooding
Rain is flooding into the hold
Bleeding to death and she's falling
Lifting gas is draining away

We're down lads, came a cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last

Here lie their dreams as they stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines they run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on

Free the captives from the chains

That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die

Now we need to know the truth now

So we live and breathe again

Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away

With a brother against brother
Situation like no other, it’s a picture of despair

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don’t know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what’s ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid

Walking in a dark world that’s been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven’s call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man’s laugh
The fear that’s inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote

Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill

Living with temptation
Wanting and crime

He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There’s something that inside has died

But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned

Who motivates the motivator
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all ok
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know

Out in the void of the vast
Throughout the torrents of time
Millenniums I had to outlast
Alone in this heart of mine

Built and designed to obey
To keep man alive

Now they struggle to survive

Forever free
Free from the split in my mind

My eyes have been blind
The way of the ways - the line of the lines

Oh Atlantis, I hear your call

I am the one - you are the ones
I will protect you - my brothers and sons
I have returned - to fight this battle
I am the savior - my heart is made
Made of metal

A shadow from somewhere beyond
Is reaching out its claw
Twisting the rays of the sun
My children you ain't gonna fall

I'll raise my blade
The time for reprisal is here
It's not too late

Without you it's blurry, and I can't see why,
My friends say James are you feeling alright?
And I just think that I'm dreaming all night,
When I'm with you I feel I've been saved,
And I want to thank your Mum and Dad for what they made.
So I just want to say I'm going to keep you,
For life, 24/7 I hope to.

Hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

You're my perfect dream, we're the perfect team,
I'm the King, you're the Queen, you're the book that I read,
Without you it feels like there's no me,
And that's why its you that I just want to keep,
How many times have I told you that I love you?
So many times you know I want to hug you,
So come and show me what love means,
Coz I don't really know I just seen it in my dreams

I swear hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,

It's crazy, I don't think you recognize how strong the feelings are,
So I dedicated this song to you.

Look I hope you recognize now what you really mean,
Without you I couldn't do this song I sing
And I hope you like it too, coz it's nothing but the truth
Your not number 1 but you will be soon

Believe hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,

Ironik,"Yours was the perfect love; I swear it was
Until I had your love my world was cold
I did what most men do, and I messed it up
But when I got you back my world was whole

The playa thing I let it go
Thought our life was set in stone
But it wasn't and I'm here alone
Nothing is in front of me
I feel I can?t even breathe
Don't think that I can't handle this baby I'm so

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

Where do I go from here? I'm so lost
You know how hard it is?
Fighting my way through this
Shouldn't even be like this,
Shouldn't have to feel like this
No, no no

Can't even have company
Nobody can talk to me
I messed up, bound it up fought myself through
Looking through my gallery; drinking and smoking weed
I hate you for doing this to me girl I'm so

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

(Broken, broken, broken)
Never thought I'd be this low down in my life
I swear I'm?

I knew what I had was enough
But that was long before you
And I, thought nothing could hold me down
Just me and myself from hanging out
That was my life without you

You came and changed everything
Took me from fall to spring
Degraded by love, for you il do anything

So I let go, can't say no
You got me on foot patrol
With you I believe anything you need
You just gotta say so
When I'm with you, its hard to, keep myself under control
Its alright I'm on the other side of love
You got me on foot patrol

Yer I've made some mistakes in my life
But I never stopped to think twice
And that's what you showed me
For the first time, now when I close my eyes
I see my vision to survive
Now I can't live without you

You came and changed everything
Took me from fall to spring
Degraded by love, for you il do anything

So I let go, can't say no

I feel like nothing can be wrong
Your heart is mine and I dedicate this song
To you for life, I ain't gonna strive

Ironik,"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war, 
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before, 
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend 
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again, 
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way... 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

Springtime was always my favorite time of year, 
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain 
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears 
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain 
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die 
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized 
No, staring at his picture I realized 
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad 
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there 
I know that he has found another friend 
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow 
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
But all good things, they say, never last 

All good things that say, never last 
And love, it isn't love until it's past",Sometimes It Snows in April,2008

Ironik,"Look Tracy, how you doing? I ain't seen you for years
Are you married yet? Any kids? Tell me how it;s going
I cried so much when I heard you was going
And my eyes hurt a lot when I heard you was going
While you reading this grab a tissue and smile
And look at our pictures from school and just smile
You had the cutest smile
I won't lie, I pictured you walking down the aisle
We could have been so happy together
I wonder if your parents didn't want us together?
Beautiful, silly at times but real clever
I won't be surprised if I don't see you, ever
But that is the reason I wrote this letter
And if you write back I'd feel ten times better
I know good things come to an end
But sometimes its like the wrong things end.

Chorus: 
Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me
Lets run away ay ay ay ay ay [x4]


I didn't get a chance to tell you how I felt
Only my mum knew how I really felt
My heart was crushed and broke into two
I wish I could turn back time just for you
Its funny how I see all these girls and don't care
They know to do music for me, I don't care
Girls like you come rare, I mean it
And you don't even have to show it 'cause I believe it
I made a promise to you and didn't get to keep it
Best friends forever, remember, forever.
I need you forever, I'll keep you forever
But now it's never and I feel so down
My love's so strong, I need yours now
Without you I feel like I'm just down 
Could have travelled the world together up and down
I love you babe, so tell me how you feel right about now

Chorus: 
Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me

You're my perfect dream, we're the perfect team,
I'm the King, you're the Queen, you're the book that I read,
Without you it feels like there's no me,
And that's why its you that I just want to keep,
How many times have I told you that I love you?
So many times you know I want to hug you,
So come and show me what love means,
Coz I don't really know I just seen it in my dreams

Look I hope you recognize now what you really mean,
Without you I couldn't do this song I sing
And I hope you like it too, coz it's nothing but the truth
Your not number 1 but you will be soon

Enough behind to show that once we have camped here. Some leave more than
Others, some a memory and some a fortune, some a song. And a song can be as
Fine a memorial to a man as anything that can be left behind, 'cause you see

It's gold, and it's gold that all can share. We have a great song to
Remember Lorenz Hart by, that wonderful melody that he and Dick Rodgers

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

So understand I hope this hood shit sacred, hand on the bible I shoot it out to satin, if he ever did say shit, I really would be finer, ya you heard me nigga, anytime cuz, still serving nickels, step ya grind up, I knew the game was dirty b'fore I signed up, ya this rap shit is circus full of clowns and, otha weirdos acting silly for the croud, then they think we all the same till my pistols get to plowin, so a hunit ain't enough, gotta keep it one thousand.

It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game cause they weakling
When in the trap making penis that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis mobilin' now
Holding us down almost everybody know what it sounds of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on em they rock chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly

Back in the day I had to pay but now everybody say hey!
You lookin good bro, you makin good dough
I be like yo you didn't know? they say

Oh
And 3 more didn't know saying
Oh oh oh didn't now the know now they know they say
Oh, and when we step in the club the say
Oh oh oh there they go there go they like oh
Now 3 hoes want to go like
Oh oh oh didn't know now they know they say
Oh your girl be like oh oh oh
Now I got it for the night screaming oh

They didn't know I sell out shows in Amsterdam
And in Switzerland
Tecca Ninna spits for grands
She really dont know she about to ditch her man
And give her pants to me cuz this her jam
Damn
Tecca Ninas everywhere keep it necessary to
Steer very clear
If he dare to stare and glare that's very fair
Be drinking, Be merry
Where the ladies with the dairy air?
More black women pooping up at my shows
Like Tyler Perry there
Oh
And they didn't know I won an MTV award?
New York yelling for me like they've seen me before
They know that underground clown come so sick and dark
But they didn't know they'd see the N9ne on 106 & Park
I'm kixin it and the foes can not stop
No hoes can cock block it
My clothes in Hot Topic
They froze when I pop it
I glow in the MO
Throwing the dough
Oh you didn't know?
They say

[Chorus]

Hey yo we kixin it like a Friday night
Even though it's a Thursday
Eyes on us when we stepping out on the curb free
Chickens want the business giggling
Acting flirty
Little momma swallowed all of her vodka
She still thirsty
Probably because shes got something that's mixed in her hand
Straight to the sipper
Or maybe
It's because the reason I got my hands on you
Dancing like a stripper
We super cold head to toe
We sharp as a machete
We the hottest show in KCMO
The new Malcom & Eddie yeah
It's me and Big Yates
He know my spits ate
Shit so sick he got me spitting on The Mixed Plate
Like a disgruntled employee who just quick Gates
You read the front of the fitted homie and it's
KC
Ask who the president and they are going to
Say
Me
And now I'm rocking with the king (TECH N9NE!)
So every time we hit the clubs like a movie scene
Filling them women with their cups with Kansas City Tea
PHENOM!

[Chorus]

That's the noise you make you lady do
Fresh hypemen had me on the turn tables in 82'
Sleeping with women and popping bottles
While he was eating baby food
Murdering raps and spitting facts
Something I was made to do
See I raised a few eyebrows when I started up
Veteran Click gave me worldwide we was hard to touch
Ya'll can start the fuss
And I'm going to close you down
Popping you dick licker
Only when there is hoes around
Oh
That's what your girl be like
Killer city will show what that world be like
My world be tight
But my flows be sicker
Behind the counter and cut you
At that Paul's Liquor
I'm a show me nigga
I rep for the land
I got kool aid pumping through your man's heart
I've been marked
And respect the niggas who've been whacked

I really didn't want a bitch to see me
So I put on the spydie's took out my I.D. and
I have to keep the knife right behind me till ya by me

Enamorada, de ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Oh

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny how

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try (though you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel (baby)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it's strange how fate can play a part

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part",Ain't It Funny,2002

Livin' life up on the corner
Slangin' rocks and smokin' weed
From an eightball to a G
Worked my way to a ki
All I can try to do is hold on
Caught up in the struggle
Seems the only way to be
Never gone find no peace
Till the day they bury me
All I can try to do is be strong

And n****, you can find me
Hangin' up on the corner
Or layin' up in the cut
Tryin' to get my motherf***in' money right
My hammer right beside me
And I really don't give a f***
If somebody gotta die tonight
'Cause look...n****, my pocket full of stones

And this is all I do, all I do

Gotta be on the lookout for them stick-up boys
'Cause when they come
They be straight hemmin' n****s up
And it really all about takin' that money, man
If they catch me, they better kill me
Ain't comin' out like no punk
S***, can't let no n**** take nothin' from me, man

I wish that we ain't have to be so canivin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
How my n****s in the pen doin' time just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that genocide wasn't survivin' just to make it out the ghetto

Everyday is just weed, rocks, and pistols, cops comin' to git you
When n****s that want to put you on shirts readin', ""We Miss You""
Everything I been through, nothin' but issues
Tired of goin' to funerals and pa**in' moms the tissue
Getcha prayer in ya life, it's hard to listen
When there ain't nothin' fair in ya life
It's God that's missin', that's what they be tellin' me
And I try to wait but He be takin' so long
I'll probably catch another felony, inhalin' weed
Keepin' me broke, though, I slangs my coke
I probably push less weight than the trees I smoke
And ain't no hope for tomorrow, hot, heavy wit sorrow
Cause my peers bring tears from findin' em full of hollows
I know you probably goin' through the same thing
The same pain, cause we caught up in the same game
And don't a damn thing change, n****, bump this song

Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours
Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse
Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'
Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin
Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again

[Repeat 1]

Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
And to let you know, you just as good as gold
It's like we got our own little private party goin' on
And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan
It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' 'cause I'mma kidnap you for the weekend
Now we at the pad about to crack a case
Playin' the couch like Caesar's, she feedin' me grapes
Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great
But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next

If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
'cause it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on

Now mami, let's get serious, 'cause by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get
There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat
Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us

Phone booth receiver resting upon her front tooth
As she mines her pockets for change
She's looking about for the narrator
The dial tone is broken by the operator
Who hums the curious thing about leather

And it pushed you down to another place
Where all the conversations bear your name
Sunday morning traffic came
And it pushed you down to another place
Where all the situations taste the same

Cynthia Weston gets so depressed
When she can't place the names for the pop IQ test
As the billboard's thinking differently

And it pushed you down to another place
Where all the conversations bear your name
Sunday morning traffic came
And it pushed you down to another place
Where all the situations taste the same

Perhaps you lapse into a day dream
Where it may seem too complex and day life esque
So you wonder, worry, you might find it hard to distinguish
That in which the dream that you just had from the daytime genre

The cops come busting in looking for Miss Weston
The circus is calling, looking for a darling

She says she wants to spend the day with me
She tells me of the time she went to rescue all her friends
From the empty, corner pharmacy
I wonder how she feels

And as I lay, I heard the crumbling mountain tops
Inside my feeble wandering, restless disposition
Wondering if she's been here all along
Wandering in and out of the hallways of my mind

And so I lay beside her on the mattress in her kitchen
And we watched the sun come up
She took my hand beneath the blankets to her body
And she whispered softly, that she was glad that we had met

And leave me there until I get old
You and me, I could wish we're meant to be
Together until I get old

And we'll sail away into the sun some day
You and me on a holiday
Wait for me or tell me now time will pass
More peacefully

And if you go the world will fell sorry for me
At least on this we'll agree
And I'll hold my breath until you say when
You'll stay young will I old by then?

I could pretend that you and I will never end
If I don't break perhaps we'll bend
Here I am on the shore you wave
To me to come aboard

Irving Berlin,"Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any money today?

Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold

Irving Berlin,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day father started digging in a field
Hoping to find some soil

He dug and he dug and what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now who am I?

I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em jell

And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
They could go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind

They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes 'round

If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes, indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you all you need

Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea

What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
There's a book of regulations
As to who sits next to who

But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastes' protocol
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

An Ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves

He can come and let his hair down
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife

But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

I've been highly complimented
And I thank you what is more
You'll be damned well represented
By your new ambassador

For my one ambition is to make them fall
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
In the handbag that I'll carry
There's a precious little note

To their highnesses from Harry
Introducing me he wrote:
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""

There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes
To make friends across the sea
I'll make being smart an important part
Of my foreign policy

I'll cement our good relations
When I give my first affair
There'll be special invitations
To the Duke and Duchess there

Who's already written asking them to call
Not the priestess with the leastes'
But the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball",The Hostess With the Mostes' on the Ball,1950
Irving Berlin,"An old hand at giving parties
And I've learned an awful lot
The best reason for a party
And what keeps it boiling hot
An occasion when you've got

Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz

Put on your dancing shoes
Here comes some happy news
Break up in twos and twos
To a fox-trot or a waltz

You and someone have parted
And your lonely heart yearns
While you're there broken hearted
Suddenly he returns

That's something to dance about
With someone to dance it with
Pick something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz

To a Charleston or a waltz
To a Tango or a waltz

Dance to the blues
Something to dance about

Irving Berlin,"I have an ear for music, and I have an eye for a maid. 
I like a pretty girlie, with each pretty tune that's played. 
They go together, like sunny weather goes with the month of May. 
I've studied girls and music, so I'm qualified to say 

A pretty girl is like a melody that haunts you night and day, 
Just like the strain of a haunting refrain, 
She'll start up on a marathon and run a-round your brain. 
You can't escape she's in your memory. by morning night and noon. 
She will leave you and then come back a-gain,

But Walter Winchell won't approve

So how about one bouquet
For the Navy?

One word of praise that'd fall from your lips
One cheer and then we'll go back to our ships
Hip hip hooray

You're letting them get away
With the gravy
Just let them know
That an Army show

Could never be a hit without the Navy

The Army's what you may prefer
But in the social register
Is where you'll have to look for the Navy
If you would like to touch the gilt

Of Astor or a Vanderbilt
You'll have to come around to the Navy
The show was in the alley
It simply wouldn't do

Until the big finale
With Navy white and blue

he'd been in camp for sevral weeks and he was looking fine;
His muscles had developed and his cheeks were rosy red,

Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;

you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!

Some day they're going to find him dead;
Ill amputate his reveille, and step upon it heavily,

Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;

you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Oh! boy the minute the battle is over,
Oh! boy the minute the foe is dead;
I'll put my uniform away, and move to Philadelphia,
And spend the rest of my life in bed.

A bugler in the army is the luckiest of men,
He wakes the boys at five and then goes back to bed again;
He doesn't have to blow again until the afternoon,
If evry thing goes well with me I'll be a bugler soon.

Moonlight gives me the Milky Way.

Got no checkbooks, got no banks,
Still, I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning 
And the moon at night.

And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
I'm alright!

And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
and i know, that everything's alright",I Got the Sun in the Morning,1999

In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

Irving Berlin,"It gets lonely in the White House when your cares begin
And the White House is a big place to be lonely in
When you're all alone there staring into space
And you wish the man you ran against could be there in your place
It gets lonely in the White House when you've been attacked
By the loyal opposition getting in the act
If you make the wrong decision, when the final chips are down
The White House is the loneliest place in town
It gets lonely in the White House when you're sitting there
And you have to do your thinking in a rocking chair
When some exercise would keep you feeling well
But a journey to the golf course and the country's gone to hell
When the budget isn't balanced and you're in the red
And you feel it would be better to be dead than red
When your speech is optimistic but the stocks keep tumblin' down
The White House is the loneliest place in town",It Gets Lonely in the White House,2001
Irving Berlin,"Let's take an old fashioned walk, I'm just bursting with talk.
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.

I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,
There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.",Let's Take an Old Fashioned Walk,2001
Irving Berlin,"[Verse:]
Ten generations of Constantins
Lived very comf'table lives
They were contented to live in style
Supported by their wives
Daughters of men who were wealthy
Fitted them like a glove
They all married for money
I mean to marry for love

[Refrain:]
It's an old-fashioned idea, marrying for love
And that old-fashioned idea's what I'm thinking of
Where there's love, poets have said
Two can live as one
That's an old-fashioned idea
But it's being done
When I find the man that I'm crazy about
There's much that I could do without
But I couldn't do without love
Just an old-fashioned romance with a moon above
A romance, one that will end marrying for love
That's the kind of love
That I'm thinking of

Those dear old songs were sung
Sweet melodies, their memories
Around my heart still cling
That's why I long to hear a song
Like mother used to sing
[Rag Verse:]
I don't care for long haired musicians
With their classy melodies
They have lots of highbrow ambitions
But their music doesn't please
Give me something snappy and popular
The kind that darkies play
Lots of rhythm
And I go with 'em
That's why I say
[Rag Refrain:]
Musical Demon
Set your honey a-dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag
To some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy
Of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because
I want to listen to rag

Say it isn't so,
Everyone is saying
You don't love me,
Say it isn't so.

Everywhere i go,
Everyone i know,

Whispers that you're growing tired of me,
Say it isn't so.
People say that you,

Found somebody new,
And it won't be long
Before you leave me,
Say it isn't true,

That's all i want to know,

And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.","Say It Isn't So, song",2002
Irving Berlin,"The roses each one
Met with the sun
Sweetheart when I met you
The sunshine had fled
The roses were dead
Sweetheart when I lost you

I lost the sunshine and roses
I lost the heavens of blue
I lost the beautiful rainbow
I lost the morning dew
I lost the angel who gave me
Summer, the whole winter through
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness
When I lost you

The birds ceased their song
Right turned to wrong
Sweetheart when I lost you
A day turned to years
The world seemed in tears

Irving Berlin,"[1st verse:]
Johnny was bashful and shy
Nobody understood why 
Mary loved him
All the other girls passed him by
Everyone wanted to know
How she could pick such a beau
With a twinkle in her eye
She made this reply
[1st chorus:]
He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by it's cover
He's got the face of an Angel
But there's a Devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit that he's nothing at all
But in a morris chair
You'd be surprised
[2nd verse:]
Mary continued to praise
Johnny's remarkable ways
To the ladies
And you know advertising pays
Now Johnny's never alone
He has the busiest phone
Almost every other day
A new girl will say
[2nd chorus:]
He's not so good in the house but on a bench in the park
You'd be surprised
He isn't much in the light but when he gets in the dark 
You'd be surprised
I know he looks as slow as the Erie
But you don't know the half of it, dearie
He looks as cold as an Eskimo
But there's fire in his eyes
He doesn't say very much but when he starts in to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brain
But in a taxicab
You'd be surprised","You'd Be Surprised, song (from ""Ziegfeld Follies of 1919"")",2002

Irving Berlin,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day, father started digging in a field, hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and, what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out
With a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now, who am I?

I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em gel
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostest on the ball

They would go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostest on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you, all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostest on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea
What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

There's a book of regulations 
As to who sits next to who
But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastest protocol
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

An ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down, ooh!
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
Of the priestess with the leastest
Nor the hostess with the mostest
With the mostest on the ball",The Hostess with the Mostess' on the Ball,2006
Irving Berlin,"I'm honored, I'm flattered
This greeting really mattered
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned
I like your attention

There's a girl in Tennessee
Who's sorry she met up with me
Can't go back to Tennessee

There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha

Can't go back to Arkansas

For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us
With a bad, bad man

We've been chasing up and down
That other show has just left town
And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man

You may love us and leave us
But the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek
When the minstrels come next week

When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man

For years I have yearned to
Play towns I could return to
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak
I'm glad you're not frightened
The atmosphere has brightened
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week

Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man

Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man

Send your mothers on Wednesday
Because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime
I'll have lots of open time

Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest
With a bad, bad man

I'm enlightened but frightened
Tho' my interest you've heightened
It might turn out to be
That you're much too much for me

So I'll go back to my tent
And someday when you're old and bent
Think of hours you might have spent

Sun tan, shade of green
Or an olive drab color scheme

She wore the dress, and I stayed home

Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can

For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand

When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?
Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""

They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name

Irving Fazola,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love",I Can't Give You Anything but Love,1990
Irving Mills,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1991
Irving Mills,"I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 

If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway. 

Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 
She pulls my man around by her apron strings. 
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair, 
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere. 

I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, 
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie, 
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye 
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord. 

I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord! 
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I got those St. Louis blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, 
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord!",St. Louis Blues,1995
Irving Mills,"Who's that coming down the street?
Good old organ grinder Pete
He's the latest rhythm king
With his organ grinder's swing
Dadya, Pa swings it, so does Ma
Dadya, Ma swings it, so does Pa
Dadya, you swing it, so do I
Dadya, I swing it so do you
 
When he turns that handle down
Music goes around and 'round
Ev'rybody starts to sing 
To that organ grinder's swing
Trala,  Pa swings it, so does Ma
Trala, Ma swings it, so does Pa
Trala, you swing it, so do I
Trala, I swing it so do you
 
All the children tag along
Just to listen to his song
Monkey dancing on a string
To the organ grinder's swing
O-hum, Pa swings it, so does Ma
O-hum, Ma swings it, so does Pa
O-hum, you swing it, so do I
O-hum, I swing it so do you
 

",Organ Grinder's Swing,1998
Irving Mills,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,1999
