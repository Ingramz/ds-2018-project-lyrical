Lillian Axe,"Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
And every moment I'm awake
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

Now as I walk down this winding road,
I need you to lighten the load.
Hey, now, take my hand;
I'll lead you to the Promised Land.

One cold December so long ago,
We watched the snow cling to the trees.
Your lips were so warm as you kissed my hand
We would have sailed the seven seas.
But when you walked away,
Said you could not stay,
And love lay dying like a wounded dove.
But if you come back now,
I will take your hand
And lead you to the Promised Land.

Are you feeling lonely? Do you need a friend?
Well, is the pain too much to stand?
The seeds of love are sown inside
And the memories of our lives will guide our hand.
So as you fly away
I will sing the day
And meet you in the Promised Land.

Take my hand to the Promised Land.

But when you walked away,
Said you could not stay,
And love lay bleeding like a wounded dove.
But if it needs to be
Then I will set you free.
And meet you in the Promised Land.

Take my hand to the Promised Land.

Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
And every moment I'm awake
I pray the Lord your soul to take.

",The Promised Land,1992
Lillian Axe,"Every now and then, I feel the autumn wind

And then I think of you

It lingers for a lifetime, and holds my breath in check

I don't know what to do.



Did you think I would see it coming

Turn around, look at me I'm running

Now, my love

Through the years, all the pain and suffering

Children's cries, amount to nothing

Rise above



What you see is what you get

Stake your life now, place your bet

You better believe I know, I'll be letting you go.



Will you ever know what I wanted to say?

Maybe you'll find a way

Maybe I'll be alright

Remember this night and I'll see you someday.



Many nights, I listened to

The sounds that made me cry and kept

My soul awake



But even in the darkness,

I could see the endless oceans

That our tears would make.



Why'd you lay our love to rest?

Gave it up, put it to the test of time, my love

My life's just not the same

Not a question of who's to blame,

I'll rise above



Don't you know that Love is War

That's what we're living for

You better believe I know,

I'll be letting you go



Will you ever know what I wanted to say?

Maybe you'll find a way

Maybe I'll be alright

Remember this night

And I'll see you someday.



Will you ever know what I wanted to say?

Maybe you'll find a way

Maybe I'll be alright



Remember this night, and I'll See You Someday.

Will you ever know what I wanted to say?

Maybe you'll find a way

Maybe I'll be alright

Remember this night, and I'll See Ya, I'll See You Someday



",See You Someday,1992
Lillian Axe,"I can move the mountains on a clear day,

But sometimes they can crash into the sea.

Look around, choose your poison.

Otherwise, you'll have no choice in living

Your life the way it's mean to be.



But one more believer is all that we need.

The scars on our knees is the proof that we bleed.

But I know, oh, I know

Where to go



Oh, 'cause she's my salvation

When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.

She's my salvation.



One lover's pain is another man's relief.

But I know, oh, I know

This feeling's got to go.



When the time is right, you'll see a new way.

The road is paved with gold and leads you home again.



Bad news most everyday,

Wonder why I run away

Got to find a sanctuary.

Find your own peace in the rules that you make.



Believin' your eyes is the first big mistake.

But I know, oh, I know

Where to go.



Oh, 'cause she's my salvation

When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.

Oh, now, she's my salvation.

One lover's pain is another man's relief.

But I know, oh, I know

This feeling's got to go.



Now she's my salvation

When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.

Oh, now she's my inspiration

Unspoken lies, another fool's belief.

But I know, oh, I know

This feeling's got to go.

She's my Salvation, She's my Salvation

She's my Salvation, She's my Salvation



The first big mistake is letting

The things around you get you down.

Find salvation in something or someone

And make that your sanctuary.



Unless you do this, you're lost.



",She's My Salvation,1992
Lillian Axe,"Every day about this time 
I lose my reason and my rhyme, 
Everything around me's getting clearer. 

Season's changing quickly, 
My attitude is strictly here and now 
The time is getting nearer. 
  
But it's all right now 
To run along with me 
Maybe I'll make you see. 
I'm a true believer, 
A true believer, baby 
Any time or any place at all. 
  
No matter what you heard before 
You never know just what's in store 
Until you've found the road you're taking. 
But even now I'm killing time, 
Believing you were only mine, I guess, 
That rules were made for breaking. 
  
Maybe time will tell 
If you learned your lessons well. 
So, have some faith in me. 
I'm a true believe, 
A true believer, baby, 
Any time or any place at all. 
I'm a true believer 
A true believer, baby 
Any time or any place at all. 
 
Then in your sleep I saw you crying. 
But I knew, those tears were not for me. 
  
But it's all right now 
To ride along with me. 
Maybe I'll make you see. 
  
I'm a true believer 
A true believer, baby. 
Any time or any place at all 
I'm a true believer 
A true believer, baby, 
Any time or any place 
I turn around and I see your face 
Any time or any place at all 
True believer, true believer, true believer.",True Believer,1992
Lillian Axe,"Come a little closer with your thoughts of an insurrection,
A little black mark in the book of your life
Could bring a change of your affection,
Got an one track mind, it's a sign of the times,
Find a whole new revelation,
Prime time, any time, pay the bailiff for your crime,
Don't lose your concentration,

No, No,No, I don't want to be crucified
Got a heavy cross to bear when there's salt in your lacerations
At least when I die I can look 'em in the eye,
See them off to eternal damnation,
See the bloodstained curtains in the temple of love
Where the true is a state of your mind,
Kneel down, kiss the ground,
Better never make a sound
How can they see when they're so damn blind 

[Chorus]
Can you believe in something
Not fit for their consumption 
Hold on strong to the end
Use the force in the back of your mind
I can't accept what they say
I choose to go my own way
I don't want to be crucified

Flying high, sanctify, living a lie
By the hand of intoxication,
Under attack, see the scars on my back,
Think it's time for a needed vacation

No, No,No, I don't want to be crucified",Crucified,1993
Lillian Axe,"Do you remember, when our lives were so complete ?
Long cold Decembers, so bitter sweet

[Chorus: ]
But if you could set aside one day
That I could hold forever
I would save the day that I met you

Is it still magic although we've grown worlds apart
It seem so tragic, so frail the heart

[Chorus:]

But if I was blessed with just one wish
To take me through my lonely life
I'd wish to go back to the day that I met you

And when you fell you're on your own
Well just believe you're not alone
And you fell the warmth
That we shared years ago
Don't be blue

One painful morning, I stared straight into the sun
It overwhelmed me, I came undone

[Chorus:]

So, if you can find it in your heart
To be forgiving to a broken man
We'll go back to the day that I met you",The Day I Met You,1993
Lillian Axe,"I'm walking alone incognito so no one will know
But wandering eyes catch a glimpse of what's hidden below
Does there always have to be this complication?
Do you have to live by selfish motivation?

[Chorus]
Take my hand, we'll hide away,
We'll sleep beneath the open skies,
What you say and what you do
They're always gonna criticize
Make your fantasies the drive
It seem that just the strong survive
So whenever you can feel it
Keep your deep blue shadows alive

I'm watching your steps, I've got eyes in the back of my head
Don't make the wrong moves, if they see you
You're better off dead, yeah,
Do I always have to give some explanation?
To the critics who can't understand expression?

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",Deep Blue Shadows,1993
Lillian Axe,"Time and time again
I need reminding of where I've been
Helplessly scared, left so alone
This time I'll make a journey on my own
Don't stop me now, as this begins
I fell a brave and new awakening

Yet life goes on
But I'll be gone
A brand new life awaits me
The setting sun time as begun
I've settled down, so take my

Mind, slipping in a deep freeze
Blind, Living with an uneased mind,
Doing what I dawn please time and again
Sin, Looking at the shit that I'm in,
Smiling with a Cheshire cat grin.
Floating in a Deep freeze

Upon your lap I rest my head,
I thank my lucky stars that I'm not dead yet,
The fields of green, the mountainsides,
I fly beyond them and there's a sea of sorrow,
Guide me to my rest
And in my deep freeze I am possessed,

But life goes on
Embrace the dawn
A brand new song awaits you
Control your fear but keep it near
I'm melting down so take

Mind, slipping in a deep freeze
Blind, Living with an uneased mind,
Doing what I dawn please time and again

Ashamed of the places I've seen and I've been

Lillian Axe,"I've been watching from across the room
As you free your mind,
They all tell me that you're far away,
I believe I'll stay awhile
I'd like to help you find your golden mile

Dreaming, Crying, Hoping, Trying,
Praying, Dying,
Gets you through another day

Running, Flying, Escape, Denying,
No one's trying to explain

What do you want?
What do you need?
Do you enjoy watching me plead?
What do you see?
Who do you Love?
The moonlight in your blood.
What do you feel?
Who do you love?
There's moonlight in your blood.

Spend your nights inside a silk cocoon,
Butterfly,
Your soul could never die,
I see you leave us as you stare at the moon,
And you'll live again,
I only wish that I could share your pain,
What a shame.

[Chorus: x2]",Moonlight in Your Blood,1993
Lillian Axe,"Feel like I'm loosin' again
Slipping away is the faith I used to cling to
Life seems too strange to be real
Watching you take it all in stride
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
One for you

Time has no mind for regret
Watching you bite on the bullet you were born with
How do you sit there at ease
While something inside steals your peace
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
Just for you
One for you

No one can convince me that there's method to this madness
As I watch you fade
The hours tick away
With the courage of a lion
And the stead-fast heart of gold
You gave me strength while the flames of my hope
Burn so cold
Feeling the heat once again
Handed us hope as you rose up from the ashes
Gone is the pain so be free
Now in your name we can see

Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain

Lillian Axe,"Well I felt this coming on for a long, long time
When everything turns red, it's such a bad sign
Just a little bit of light would've helped me see
That every loaded gun wasn't aimed at me
Could've set me free

You made me
Betrayed me
Too many times
A jaded Delilah
Live, learn, and die

Now you know

Been livin' with my head in the deep, blue sea
So why does everyone seem so afraid of me
Just a little bit of air would've helped me breathe
When there is no such solution take your leave
Put your mind at ease

Release me just to please me, way too late
Your time was impatient, seal my fate

Now you know

You think the start of this was yesterday
Been scratchin' and clawin' just to find my way out
How could you ever let me dig so deep?

Well, now I know
Now you know

Lillian Axe,"Hey brother, can you spare some time?
It seems I've lost my mind
I'm one strange personality.
Have I gone crazy?
Yeah, Please take me somewhere new.

I don't associate with people, you see,
Maybe that's what's troubling me,
I feel rebellion's overdue,
So chain me up now,
You'll get what's coming to you

Hey, I'm Schizophrenia

Thunderstorms evolving inside of me,
Straight jacket quick and swallow the key,

Lillian Axe,"Cast your worries to the seas,
You can do just what you please,
Don't you know that happyness is free,
Disguised to hide the reasons,
We believe just what we see.

It's time to look beyond the real,
While you create the life you feel,
Everybody needs their time,
Scaling mountains they can't climb,
Falling down to their knees.

[Chorus]
It's a sign of the times
Do you want to be
Just a sign of the times
It's the end of the line
Such a tragedy
It's a sign of the times

Shooting stars light up the sky
We march on prepared to die
I won't let them take my sense of pride, no,
Safe beneath the shelter,
But your face you cannot hide

It's time that people realize
What stares them right between their eyes
Everybody's wasting time,
Trying to make the world all rhyme,
It's so easy to see

Adam: Yeah, little brother, but that was then and this is now.


Read the story that I'm sure you've heard before,

A turn of your back, it slips away.

See the vultures as they climb all over you,

Taken for granted, kiss me good-bye

Make believe come true

We're just wasting time
While we're running blind
Stop the hate, before it's too late,
We're just losing time,
Seeing colorblind
Stop the hate, one more chance before we go,

I'm so sick and tired of your complaining,
Tie your hands behind your back,
With your eyes shut, we fade to black.
Their promises are lies
And smiles behind their lying eyes
Take your money for the cause
They crush you with their vicious jaws,
What happened to integrity, with me for you
And you for me

Lillian Axe,"I had a dream of great catastrophes
And all the children cried a thousand seas
While all the love we watched them lay to rest
We stood up straight and tall and let them
Let them put us to the test
And we won, and love have saved the day
Then I woke, and evil got away

And on your throne you condescend so well
If I could have my way you'd burn in hell
While I watched you steal the bread from open arms
As you promise to protect their lives from harm

Bow down to those who prey
For they shall have their day

Down so low, can't you look around and see
There's hope, truth is gonna set you free
You don't know, meaning of equality

Fighting to erase the dynasty
Of those who prey on me
And on your life you swear on lust and greed
But the cries of hurting children makes you bleed
Can you see your demon right before your eyes
They're no good to you, except for cheap disguise

Bow down to those who prey
For they shall have their day

Down so low, can't you look around and see
There's hope, truth is gonna set you free

Lillian Axe,"Haven't seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold just passing time
Last time we met was a low-lit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time
Except you
You were talking about the end of the world

I took the money
I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You lead me on with those innocent eyes
You know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart

You were acting like it was the end of the world

'Til the end of the world",Until the End of the World,2007
Lillian Axe,"First to cast the stone
I'd rather walk my miles alone
Last to take the blame
I'd rather take the hit than devastate the lame

Your eyes are blind
Your tongue is tied
Dumb to the gifts that we've received
Listen deaf ears
Strands of the march
Nothing has changed, all wasted years

Burning the home crushing the bone
Wasting the precious moments
Living to die draining the seas
Stealing the gems with hands unkept 

Jesus wept

Air too thick to breathe
I watched the demons play naïve
Blood too thick to taste
I pull the leeches from my arm so not to waste

Gorged like the pig fat like the tick
Carrying bellies set to break
High on your throne ruling alone 
Preaching commandments of your own

Leaving your home nursing the bone
Savoring precious moments
Dying to live filling the seas
Laying at the gold sheets where you slept

Jesus wept (4x)

Bleeding from holes
On my body beat and broken 
I don't give a damn
How you accumulated tokens

Leaving your home nursing the bone
Savoring precious moments
Dying to live filling the seas
Laying at the gold sheets where you slept

In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade In Blue,2013
Lillian Leach,"Smoke from your cigarette clouds my eyes
Things that you speak of make me realize
That you've found someone else to take my place
In your heart, in your heart

There was a time you would say
I was the only one who could bring
Happiness to you or anyone
But now those days are gone

Gone are the days when we would say
We were meant for each other
Gone are the days, those wonderful days
When on you kisses I would smother

Smoke from your cigarette clouds my eyes
Please don't say it, darling, won't you realize
And tell me you'll forgive me
Before those days are gone, gone ",Smoke from Your Cigarette,1996
Lillian Miles,"Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental
A way of dancing that's really ""entre nous""

It's very subtle, The Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, The Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance

It's quite the fashion, The Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your song

Two bodies swaying, The Continental
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of
So keep on dancing, The Continental
For it's a song of romance and of love

You kiss while you're dancing
Not a bad idea
The Continental, hm, it's continental
You sing while you're dancing

Your voice is gentle and sentimental
You stroll together arm in arm
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm
You will find while you're dancing

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do

once again runnin' away with me.

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

And you spend a few hours with them 
And you never really recover from it?

Then it's gone and you wonder if it is hate or love
But it can't be hate or love cause I don't even know the guy.

And we listened to music for hours.

And it feels like you've known them forever.

And you realize you're on your own

You can only be disappointed.

How's about a British jig and reel?

On the druggy drag ragtime USA
In Parkland International

The purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

Go straight to hell
Go straight to hell

Can you cough it up
Loud and strong?
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long

Could be any frontier, any hemisphere

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything

Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead

Lily Allen,"Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissin'
And I remember when you started callin' me your miss's
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too.

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if for only one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

Drinkin' tea in bed
Watching dvd's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
No one in the world who could replace you

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

What d'ya want? Some kinda reaction? Well OK that's fine
Alright how'd it make you feel if I said you never made me come
In the year and a half that we spent together yeah I never really had much fun

All the times that I said I was sober, well I'm afraid I lied
I'd be lying next to you and you next to me
All the while I was high as a kite

I can see it in your face as you break it to me gentle yeah you really must think you're great
Well let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks when I work my way through your mates

I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game

So you thought this was gonna be easy, well you're out of luck
Well let's rewind let's turn back time
To when you couldn't get it up

You know what it shoulda ended there
That's when I shoulda shown you the door
As if that weren't enough to deal with
You became premature

Sorry if ya feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
Now I'm gonna do to you what you did to me
I'm gonna reciprocate",Not Big,2006

Do what you do
Feel what you feel,
As long as it's real.

And give what you give
Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real.

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself.
This horsey also told me,
I should keep my friends close but my enemies closer,
So as to protect myself.

A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper

She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

She was the type to watch Oprah and The Today Show
Be on the treadmill, like OK Go
Had the body that you can't pay for
That means she had some D's on her, but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive, a Drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spent class at the gym, striptease on the pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, trying hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp, but extra hard for these hoes
Reading US or People mag, trying to get these scoops
Chasing an actor for a Bentley Coupe
She recruit a ball player from the Clippers
Then came the pumps off
Thinking she Number One, when she just a jump off
Doing all she can for a man and a baby
Driving herself crazy
like the astronaut lady

He had paper since we was in, we was in High School
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ear he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, the Dame Dash dudes
Pushed the Maserati Sport, reading the ROB Report
Wanted to be Mike, but he was never live in sports
Since golf was in, he was in the driving course
To live the rap life is what he was striving for
Spending cash at the bar to get credit
Drinking Chandon just because BIG said
They say Ye is, but dude big-headed
Rocked the fur in the summer, so, somebody'll pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his myspace page, half naked
It's a shame what they do for fame, and to be respected

Unbreakable like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it, where we try too much
Losing yourself and your lying and stuff
Wishing for the diamond cuffs, searching for the ring
Where love is not a mystery, it's everything, sing

Lily Allen,"Don't get me wrong, if I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights, whenever you walk by
Don't get me wrong, if you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong, if I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks that go off when you smile
Don't get me wrong, if I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander across a moonlit mile

Once in a while, two people meet
Seemingly for no reason, they just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder showers everywhere
But who can explain the thunder and rain, but there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong, if I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow, but hopeless yesterday

It might just be fantastic, don't get me wrong",Don't Get Me Wrong,2007

Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair my dear, Mon frere

I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
Get off your lazy arse
Alfie, please use your brain
Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray
I'm feeling guilty if I leading you astray
Now, how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

But she's nearly 30 now and she's out every night
I see that look in her face she's got that look in her eye
She's thinking how did I get here and wondering why

It's sad but it's true how society says
Her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

She's got an alright job but it's not a career
Wherever she thinks about it, it brings her to tears
Cause all she wants is a boyfriend
She gets one-night stands
She's thinking how did I get here
I'm doing all that I can

You always were and you always will be the taller and the prettier one

I don't know why I felt the need to drag it out for all these years
All the pain I've caused you
The constant flow of all the tears
Believe me when I say that I cannot apologize enough
When all you ever wanted from me was a token of my love
And if it's not too late
Could you please find it deep within your heart
To try and go back go back to the start

I've been so evil with my constant invasions
But you made it so easy for me
You always rise to the occasion
I'll always pull you up on every stupid thing that you say

You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea

Is Caucasian

For tax evasion

Just once please try no to be so mean (whoa oh oh)
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on I'll say it slowly (Romance!)
You can do it babe
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad, I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothin' else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love

Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Think it must be love (I love you)
I think it must be love (I love you)
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete
I think it must be
True love, it must be true love
It must be true love

Nothin' else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

Lily Allen,"I suppose I should tell you what this bitch is thinkin'
You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen
I won't be braggin' 'bout my cars or talkin' 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you 'cause I've got a brain

If I told you 'bout my sex life, you'd call me a slut

Well, you better be rich, or be real good at cookin'
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face or you'll end up on your own

Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
Have you thought about your butt? Who's gonna tear it in two?
We've never had it so good, uh-huh, we're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm, you've misunderstood

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I Love You""

Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear

Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you

Lily Allen,"It seems like only yesterday you were with somebody else
Soon as it was over though I had claimed you for myself
Didn't take me long before I had moved my stuff to yours
Glad to leave the past behind and I'm glad to close the door

Because you know I love you
Because you know I love you

So far it's been so good and it seems we'll stand the test of time
You never call me ""baby"" but you refer to me as ""mine""
What I like the best is how you can keep me on my toes
Staying home with you is better than sticking things up my nose

I had that awful feeling
That I needed help
My life had lost its meaning
But you saved me from myself

As long as I got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me
Well that's swell

You sleep with your mouth wide open and you go to the pub alone
You only cook from frozen but I don't ever hear you moan
You let me lie in bed when you're doing breakfast with the kids
Landing on my feet with you I'm so happy this is how we live

Because you know I love you
Because you know I love you

This is more than I can take
I'd give everything I own

Will someone else please take my place?

I can't breathe, in fact I'm choking on the air
It's all over, I can see it in on your eyes
Pull my hand down, heavily I sigh

Too scared to give me heart up now
I'm not brave enough to play my part now

Can you guarantee that you'll stay

I'm still waiting for the love to kick in
Sometimes when I watch you sleeping
I keep hand to check you're breathing

And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

what a mad day
Now I see everything in a different light
what a mad day
I was up in the air, and she taught me lesson alright

I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
Leaning over me, she was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher

what a mad day
Now I see everything in a different light
what a mad day
I was up in the air, and she taught me lesson alright

What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher

You have left this world,
But we'll miss our Kate,
Our darling girl!
We held your hand,
Kissed your lovely brow,
And bid farewell
You're sailing now

Free from the pain
You laid that burden down,
But you're strong and giving heart,
Will surely be your crown

As you slip the surly bonds of earth
And sail away
Perhaps we will meet again 
Somehow, some day

Until then, there's nothing we can do but wait,
To see once more, 
Our darling Kate

All those nights we sang
And talked 'til the sun come up,
You fed our souls, 
You filled our cup
With your perfect words 
And oh that voice,
We fell in love, 
We had no choice.

And I can't say 
For sure where you have gone,
But in that place 
I'm bettin' there's a better song

For we've all known down here,
The taste of joy and strife
You were the sweetest note
In the chord of life.

Now you've slipped the surly bonds of earth,
And sailed away
Perhaps we will meet again 
Somehow, some day
But if there was one name I could consecrate
It would be yours
It would be Kate",Darlin' Kate,2013
Lily Lanken,"Some say a heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
And my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is like that ship out in mid ocean

They say that death is a tragedy
It comes once and it's over
But my only wish is for that deep dark abyss
Cause what's the use of living with no true lover

And it's only love, and it's only love
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out

When harm is done no love can be won

Just as soon as your plane puts down
Call me on the telephone

Counting down the hours
Through the sunshine and the showers
Today's the day
You're finally going to come my way

Let's make a date to see a movie
Some foreign film from gay Paris
I know you like to think you've got taste
So I'll let you choose the time and place
Have some dinner for two
In some eastside rendezvous
Then we'll walk
Arm in arm around the block and talk

Tonight you're mine
Let's not waste time

I do believe the die is cast
Let's try and make the night-time last
And I don't know where it's coming from

Picking something from off the ground
She was seventeen
And he said, ""Oh my God, it's Kate""
She said ""No, I'm the daughter of Kate
My name is Martha, who are you?
Ma never told me, never told me 'bout you""

Just like a boy of nineteen would do

No, she was not afraid

Trying to catch a boat that'd take 'em up river to home...

And when you've heard all the songs of love will you remember mine
Gone are the times that I walked with you and held your hand in mine

Now when you hold another's hand will you remember mine
I have sat 'neath the trees while the cool summer breeze
Blew away the sands of time

And thought of days when you were near remembering when you were mine
Gone are the times when I held you close and pressed your lips to mine
Now when you kiss another's lips will you remember mine

In the dark, down a backstreet?

A day in Newquay to look forward to
When it's not about love or trust, it's not about us
It's just having something to do

Yesterday when I still liked you
I guess now wouldn't be the time to take a break

Coz I may say things that make you feel beautiful

So kick off your shoes
So kick off your shoes

Yeah yeah yeah",Cambridge California,1996
Lilys,"Here I go out the door of my 
Apartment before I miss my train
And there's no way that is happening
Coz my girl you see
Has been doing things without me 
So I'm going to see
What's been going on without me
Is my ex a film critic?
And now living as a nanny in manhattan

Hear this from me
Some folks are telling jokes about the
Secrets she writes about all
Words for each and every one of those
Songs about people that you know

From the train to the car 
And as we drove I kept calling 
Leaving cute one liners there on your machine
I'm looking in your window 
And there's some guy looking back at me

Please tell me what the hell is happening
Well your ex, the film critic
Is now living as a nanny in Manhattan
Hear this from me
Some folks are telling jokes about the things that she wrote
Words for each and every one of those

So it should sound mean
It's just because you ain't actin' like a friend
Like our last phone call

Forget to chill
You need to know
And don't ever talk to me that way again",Can't Make Your Life Better,1996
Lilys,"Scars that stretch past elbows 
Too opaque to be called paint
They now are little jots
And memoirs
Rings in the limb that relive days spent
High enough to be relaxed as 
Corruption wrecks my life
And now you be my ride
Through lips of liberty
The youth shall tale the deeds of suicide
Build an elevator through the sky
The name is suicide
And the elevator was the plan

Didn't know for real where it would go
Got on, pushed the button in
And said home

I'm your creator elevator
And you owe me big for this
I'm the one, lift me out of here
To some place with a difference

Corruption wrecks my life
And now you be my ride
Through lips of liberty
Tomorrow shall tale the deeds of suicide
Build an elevator through the sky
The name is suicide 
And the elevator was the plan

And If your bags look
The same as they did before
Oh well, is it any wonder",Elevator Is Temporary,1996
Lilys,"I don't learn from mistake
Viva erratic viva uncertainty
I've left time to say
Viva enigma viva your mystery

I could patiently wait
Viewing with pleasure all your activities
I could script every line as you
Down bottles of pure misery

For there's been nothing in this World
Ever like the show

And it's the stuff that gets you up in the morning
And it's the stuff that keeps you dancing
As I'm buying and selling you as if you were
The same as the boots I am wearing

But I don't change things and
I'd be very leary of who does
And if pillars of steam add
Gold sheen to Virginian sunsets
You could learn to love
How now your ego is wailing

She can't tell her Daddy who she loves
It's such a white mans game
For there was not a day when they were onto us",Paz en el Hogar,1996
Lilys,"Hello, hello all here today
Down in my bag with me are gifts that you will call pure pleasure
You may if you see fit take a bit they're free
Why thank you very much sir
The gifts that you have there though lovely do look a bit silly
You couldn't give them away around here 
You couldn't give them away around here

All persons of the people 
Who are in the know
Know that where action goes
Unlike your shovel into spade kit

You read too much into things
Which clearly means all in nothing
It just keeps you from following
All the wrong things",Shovel into Spade Kit,1996
Lilys,"when you leave it will be cold outside
swing from tree to tree you're bound to die
ginger disapears with the snow

she blows wide ""O"" rings threw her mouth
he keeps her nose warm with his hand

Elle est là, la caisse, putain qu'est ce que tu fais bordel
Putain je ne vais pas me faire allumer par cette bande de cons

Grouilles toi, grouilles toi mec
Démarre, démarre, démarre, démarre vous croyez quoi
1er couplet
C'est mon univers du bruit ça pète direct
Force et honneur attitude correcte.
Bienvenue chez moi petit, chez les gangstas
Gang band de couplet ma rue fait la fiesta
L'heure de vérité il faut bien écouter
Le rap n'est pas mort d'abord j'en suis l'héritier
C'est là où ça se passe, pas grave si tu dépasses toutes les
banlieues, toutes les provinces
Alibi vous fait la passe, ambiance ghetto, rap rebelle de toute race
comme une série de patate.
Les hommes, les femmes, les joies, les drames,
N'importe quel thème je te jure que je le crame
Inspiré par la guerre, le beat je le monte en l'air
Dis à tes oreilles de ne pas faire de manière

Mais je ne suis qu'illicite, lyrics explicites
Puriste fonskar au shit
Anti-lepeniste, explosif, gore comme tous ces terroristes

Qui abrite mes potes hardcore
Ceux qui se lèvent juste pour pisser
Dans cette jungle urbaine
C'est dingue mais dans ma ue-r man

Envahir, voilà de quoi m'accuse le FN

Et un pack de Heinekein
Donc j’engrène les chiens, chiennes à s'unir afin de punir leur empire
Dans lequel on n'a pas d'avenir
À part pourrir en taule à cause d'un kilo de teush
Ou à cause d'un îlot drôle se prenant pour Starsky et Hutch

Et quelques putes veulent cohabiter dans le son
Avec moi ou ma clique
Mais tout ce que tu vas faire, c'est un featuring avec ma bite

Y me faut de la maille avant qu'on m'enterre

Dégainent leurs guns pour pouvoir te canner

Voyou tu peux sé-dan sur mon son ou celui des dissidents
Pas d'ici, enfants du ci-ment
Pas besoin de te faire un dessin

When she smiles that smile that leads you on
Ny to see it through playing out your part
Making certain when you give your heart - it's

Only for love

Some have spent their whole life searching cold and insecure
But as suddenly as that love will arrive
And you'll recognize the feeling
Your on fire.
And especially when she moves in close
When she moves that move there's no suppose
You'll find your hurting when you're apart
But when you give your heart - it's

Tell me how long will it last.
So uncertain what the future holds

Love will be its effect.
We hold the key to control our own destination

No juice in the fridge
I'm trying not to go out
I'm trying to stay in the house

And I think what am I doing
What am I doing?
I'm trying not to go out
On account of the drought

There's just a big drag going around
Last night I blew it
I played two games of pool and
I forgot my card, I left it at the bar

I dreamed that I went
To that Thai place with you
You know the one that we went to
Two nights before

Now there's just a big drag going around

Limbeck,"I wound up in a cold, dark, lonely forest
With trees so high, they nearly disappeared
In the sky a small bird was flying around
The leaves on the trees were falling

I felt as though that bird seemed quite familiar
I remembered that his name was Parking Lot
Me and that bird fell beneath a tree in the snow
And died several years ago

All my friends came calling
Thinking that I'd gone lost
All of them were searching
For me and Parking Lot

We left for a house up on the hillside
With broken stairs and graffiti on the walls
The kid, that's where he lived, wrote for a magazine
And we all stood outside talking

The owner was a man from Texas
Who had left the place and brought his family
The kid extended an invitation to me
To stay for as long as I needed

After a few years, the man got homesick
He moved back in and started cleaning up
And even though I was never lost with Parking Lot
I was glad to have friends who'd come find me

When all my friends came calling
Thinking that I had gone lost
I was simply sleeping in a parking lot

When all my friends came searching
Looking for my ghost
I was lost inside a dream
In a parking lot

Listening to the second hand
It's good to be good to people you don't understand

The smell fillin' the airs so strong, that it hurts me

I've been trying to take a break but it's just so hard
I should save the money to fix my car
I've been trying to get home but it's just so far

I just want to be content
No matter where I am
I guess I shouldn't have to take the chance
I'm gonna get back to the city where I live

So I drove downstate in a broken car
I've been six long weeks, every night in a bar
It's hard to find some rest in a place you don't know
I fell asleep on a tarp on the ground 'neath the stars

I just want to be content
No matter where I am
I guess I shouldn't have to take the chance
I'm gonna get back to the city where I live

Been refusing to finish everything on my plate

I find the way out

I guess it would be alright
But you're gonna get so much more
She's never gonna leave you alone

I can't say I'll feel sorry for you
Because I already warned you
I'm not saying that she's so bad

To get down south, I know I will

Just to get himself out of the sun
I've seen him on this line before
He's got a new hospital bracelet on
And I'll be here for a very long time

There's one man who's barely concerned
All the others seem to think she's crazy

Why are you crying on the bus?
What's wrong? What's really, really wrong?

I'll be here for a very long time
I'll be here reading the street signs as they go by

Unit he started scowling at the teenager in back
Right after he just came in

I found some paper by the desk in the lobby
I'm trying quiet not to wake you up
As the Tucson sun is coming up

I couldn't sleep, there's a TV in the lounge
But the buttons confuse me
You're in there trying to look some things up
As the Tucson sun is coming up

Street lights are turning off
The guests are waking up

As the train keeps rolling by like every hour
And the cars start stumbling by outside
It's time to find the way to my room to get some sleep

I'm trying to find the way to Bisbee
With a map that I found in the lobby
Stop for a shot from a little shop-owner
With that Tucson sun on my shoulders
Then you go through the Mule Pass tunnel
And this town has got the biggest hole I've ever seen
Hot sun's going down over Bisbee

Street lights are turning on again, everyone's going home
Look out the window, got to run to get home
See, this trains only going home three times a week
So I've got to get out of this hotel room
Run through the lobby with my stuff, across the street

To that train that's been rolling through the whole night long
As the cars start rumbling by, I'm stumbling across the street
The air outside's still got the heat from the day
I'm running through the doors, weaving through the seats

In the station praying that they wait
One minute more, stay until I climb aboard
And find myself a seat to get some sleep

But I'm tired of talking

My patience is used up
And I'm feeling worn out
The wind keeps blowing the dust in my face
And re-arranging my hairdo

And you're going your way
But I really don't care about that
Because I went my way when I was you

The future's a blank page
I don't know if you and I get each other
But I'm tired of talking

I'm in trouble, I've been here for a while

And who knows where all the people have gone

But I'm having some fruit with you

Took a swim and so did my laundry
Good morning, it's getting better by the coffee
Read a book, write a book or something
It's just free time that I took

Oh, today
I wouldn't want to live it like yesterday, honey

Selfish? I'm not selfish
I'd say I'm a pretty nice dude

I want your love, if you can give it up
And I think you got what I need
And I need to thank you
For coming to California

I was in the basement
Digging a hole beneath the house
It seemed a bear inside the washer
It was trying to get out

The air changed, some leaves fell
I sobered up and I wished you well
You were gone
I just had a lot on my mind

So many times a good thing goes to waste
And it's a shame
I've been around to see ideas fade away
And it's all the same

Put you hands to your head to stop the pain
And hear a scream louder than a freight train

So up-tight while your mind is windin' down
Toss and turn on aa sea of tranquility
Crimes of insanity-how many guilty?

Sick to death have we lost our senses?

Hear the news blues pick and choose
Try and understand you get more confused

Always complainin' and prayin' and sayin', ""So what's the use?""

Turnin' tricks jumpin' through a point of view
Like change so fantastic
More street homes for more and more spastics
Outside it's a turning tide
And so you learn there's no where no way to turn
Back from behind the window
Get a dose takin' in the freak show
Find the ugly truth that is wisdom
A home is a castle a castle can be your prison
Anger is your reaction
You can use it to take action
No time you whine your line is so basic

Limp,"I had that same dream again
I dreamed I was an old man dyin' and tryin' to repent
And facing consequences for all the shit I've put up with
But now I've run out of steam
A broken backed nostalgiac
No chance left to redeem
I'm longing for my heyday give me a change to live again

IF ONLY I WERE EIGHTEEN AGAIN
I WOULD SPEND ALL MY TIME TRYIN' TO REMEMBER WHEN
.....WAS I THAT MUCH HAPPIER THEN?
IF ONLY I WERE EIGHTEEN AGAIN....

And now I'm older it seems
Well at least while I sleep deep within my anxiety dreams
I comb my hair on over
Put my teeth in and give a grin
I recollect and reflect
Loves lost at too much cost' my conscience full of regret
And if I wake up I hope this better be a better day

IF ONLY I WERE EIGHTEEN AGAIN
I WOULD SPEND ALL MY TIME TRYIN' TO REMEMBER WHEN
.....WAS I THAT MUCH HAPPIER THEN?
IF ONLY I WERE EIGHTEEN AGAIN....

The real truth of youth is innocence is a blessed and a cursed simulcast
The simple fact is that I'm sick of every song that dwells on the past
But still I go on writing
How long can my discontent last?

When I wake from my dream
Reality kicks in and I grinned just wonderin' what it means
The whole world screams ""grow up""
And I know I can, but I don't know when!

So you should get a pen
And yourself a little note so you don't forget again

I've been gettin smoked
Lendin' out my money
Now I'm broke
Somebody's gettin' choked
Cause now its time to pay the piper
Bums are the type of shit that's in a diaper
Don't make me have to call a sniper
And wipe your brains off my windshield wiper you dirty bug
As soon as I get paid they come in masses
There's someone givin' classes on kissin' peoples asses
Unless you're livin where the trash is
Don't even come around here askin' where my cash is

Me, I'm broke.

I ain't no joke
I'll say it once again
And if I get provoked there'll be knuckles on your chin
Some people never learn
Borrowin from me you might regret it
For one I ain't no bank and you got shitty credit
As soon as I get paid they're comin' out the woodwork
Take your ass and get a job like you should jerk
Unless you're livin where the trash is
But you're not so find another spot where the cash is

Me, I'm broke

Gimme back my money, bum
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that

Stranded in the land of the lost

Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes
Keep the media dykes
As re-enforcements for the fight
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at?
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills
That keep my total bills over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out

They call me big John stud
My middle name mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thugs
That can't stand the flood
What up doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd
The sure shot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged
Learn
Temperature's too hot for sunblock
Burn
Playin with minds can get you state time
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me?
Cause it's your blood
Murder is tremendous
Crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us
They know not what they do
Our praises do

Why risk it
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals
Delicious
Word on the street is

Knocked out their front teethes
Tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the baseline
To provide rhyme

Hard as nails to the cubicle
Where you find that monster
She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit
Roll on the check
Kick a hole in the speaker
Pull the plug and inject

Mic check
So what's it all about?
Where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood of virgin eyes
Limpin on the track with Method
So get the sunblock
You get your one shot
Until you dissolve
I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere prepare
You'll be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in the zone
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back
Cause all your shit's whack
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that
Burnin up your brain like a piston
So all those who didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down

Your life is on contract

Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at?

Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now

Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged 
Learn 
Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me?

Eight essential vitamins and minerals 
Delicious

Knocked out their front teethes

Actin like they heard through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the baseline

Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster

Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone

Who's guilty?

Can I get a witness?
First things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood license to kill

A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the

He says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me
I'm just an alien

With thirty seven tons of new millennium
Dumb diddie dumb
Where's it coming from?

Oh know, which way to go
To the dance floor
It's on my stereo
Pay me no mind

About twenty eight times
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggy
Keep a skateboard

A spray can, for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon

Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell

I think I gotta feel
And pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system

Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin out hella mic skillz

I came into the world as a reject
Look into these eyes, then you'll see the size of the flames
That are pullin' on my past, burnin on my brain
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain

Hey, I think about the day
My girlie went ran with my pay when fellas came to play
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat

It's kinda sad I'm the laughing stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on
But I'm a sucker like I said, fucked up in the head

And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break but my heart will ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny

Hey baby, you're so fine

I did it all for the nookie, come on

Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it and I'm the only one
Underneath the sun who didn't get it

I can't believe that I could be deceived
By my so-called girl, but in reality she had a hidden agenda
She put my tender, heart in a blender
And still I surrender

Do we always gotta live inside a lie (a lie)

Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
Its kinda sad when you don't know the meaning

I analyze every second I exist
Beaten on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody want to hide from the gun (gun)

But You can't take that edge off that knife (no sir)

And there ain't nothing I can do

Who have poisonous darts for coppers

Snatch crumbs from me
Dark and hard
Mix bodies in the mosh pit

Thirty five to forty minutes
Smell up the bathroom

Ending up on your back
Whose whore's up in it
Anyone can match me
I crack 'em all a Guinness
Fuck how many thugs are playas?
A ball is in it

No one knows what its like
To be mistreated, to be defeated
Behind blue eyes
No one know how to say
That they're sorry and don't worry
I'm not telling lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what its like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

In the clouds
All the graves
I'll stay if you
Go away
Concrete
Tall as the sky
Movement passi'n me by
When you blush
What a rush
Reminisce
Cold crush
Next door ear to the wall
All the tension on me for the call
I wish I wish
I wish it was all that easy
I wish I wish
I wish it was all that easy",Behind Blue Eyes,2003
Limp Bizkit,"Build a bridge to your mind
Takes me there every time
Lay it all on the line
If there's a way
Build a bridge, make a path
Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be your bath
If there's a way
Only if you'll take a ride
Go with me to the other side
Even though it's gonna crumble down
I'll keep building 'till you come around
Even though it's gonna fall apart, break my heart
I'll keep building 'till I die
Build a bridge of memories
Stretch it out overseas
To the end of the world
If there's a way
Build a bridge made of pain
Send my longing down the drain
Have no reasons to complain
If there's a way
Only if you'll take a ride
Go with me to the other side
Wait wait for me wait please wait for me
Wait wait for me wait please wait for me

Hey kid, who you lookin' at?
Why you standin' all up in my face like that?
You ain't never seen a baseball bat?
A maniac knockin' on your babeball cap
You better step about ten paces back
Or you'll be layin' where your shoe laces at
Go do what your momma told you
And don't be actin' like a punk, thinkin' your a soldier
I see you got a cell phone, I got a number you can dial son, make it 911
Tell 'em stop at hef's house on the way kid
Pick up some playmates but only if they naked
Don't know how you do in your city
But 'round here we gettin' down to the nitty gritty
And I hate to put you out like that
But you've been burnin' like a fire with a mouth like that

Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a.o.k. oh
But now and then a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talkin' this and that again, oh

Let's break it down for a minute
And roll it on up in third gear for a minute
I got the 21's bumpin' on my benz, and
I got girlies in the back seat rubbin' on my friends, and
I don't really give a fuck about
What these player hatin' pussies give a fuck about
'Cause I'm a night ranger, never been a stranger
My two-way pager is lookin' for some danger
Zoolander, hit you with the magnum
Everybody get your groove on if you have one
And if you ain't got it then admit it:
It's limpbizkit, time for you to get it
All around the world and this 45 prevost
Everywhere we go we watch it on the tivo
And now you're layin' in the bed you made
Drinkin' hatorade, think about it

Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a.o.k. oh...
But now and then a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talkin' this and that again, go

Leave, thinkin' that you're all that, and then some
I've got news for you (all radio is dead)
So you're thinkin' that you're all that, and then some?
Man, I got news for you (all radio is dead)

(The radio is dead)

Let me guess, you ain't that impressed
Mister, hale - tosis of the breath
Livin' lifestyles of the wish-you-would
From the back isles of the thrifty-good
See I, I got room to talk, kid
I been layin' this track since north cackilack
And the very first day that you fell out the sack
I was in some fat laces, spinnin' on my back
Let me think, let me roll, let me ride
Let me put some funk in the trunk, triple 5
And a memory that can easy your pain
Like a melody from kurt cobain
'Cause ya', never know when it's all gonna end
And ya', never know when you'll call on a friend
So you better take a step to prepare yourself
'Cause the way you're livin' now, ain't good for your health

Thinkin' that you're all that, and then some
I've got news for you (all radio is dead)
So you're thinkin' that you're all that, and then some?
Man, I got news for you (all radio is dead)
Thinkin' that you're all that, and then some

Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun living life on the run,
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you go the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinking that you know
Everything little thing there is to know
Buy you don't really know, ya know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But i'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last

Another game another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world
Who's the man (the man in the middle) x4

Maybe i'm a target for people that are bitter
At least i can say that i've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man i hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always putting me down
Just a little skater boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive'em, now i got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still i never want it all, and i never want it now
I just want to cruise, if i loose then i'll figure it out
How the times flies, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's amazing what you learn
When you've never been taught, ya know?

No one can hear me when i cry inside a lonely world

I guess I lay awake, I guess I'll lay here and pray
Could you pour me one more drink? A glass of gasoline
Help me burn my pain, light me up in the rain

My so-called life is so good
Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down

You wonder how I've been, you ain't been checking in
Just hope my vital signs would send me home again
My baby?s in the grass, Jesus on the dash
I drive myself insane, just hoping I could stay

My so-called life is so good
Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

When deserts turn into floods, white orchids cover with mud
No magic carpet today, not today
Who takes the reigns, when I'm gone disintegrate from my throne?

Can't go wrong, can't go wrong
Can't go wrong, can't go wrong
When every day is sunshine
Everyday is sunshine
Everyday is sunshine

I was born by the river with the sunblock
Say I'm cooking up the heat so I'mma stay hot
And just like that river, I've been running ever since
I know I can't go wrong if I'm on top
I've got the shine on me, when I say me he's gotta ride for the team
Cause I'm on that
The sun hit me every morning, the club with them models
Come and feel 'em like I'm calling
The Don Perrier, probably like a cactus
Throwing every Franklin, I'm a Tim Jackson
Action the napkins, wet, no cash, got a milly after taxes
I'm on the road to winning, I've been exposed to women
Already know what they getting but with the flow in the middle
They gotta think twice
And just know that every day is like sunshine
I know, I know

No intermission in the mission
All of my idols big pimping, all of my rivals been missing
This right here ain't revival, this right here is the birth of an idol
This right here is why I work for the title, I gotta be an icon
My old man had dreams of putting nice, he rest in peace
A lil bit of him rest in me
Every time that I'm blessed to be
I work hard, got scars, I got a mother I provide for
I got homies I would die for
A big sis I would lie for but I ain't relying on this record
No, I'm working on my vernacular
I'm tryina have a lil' brains to back it up
I used to roll around town in a maxima
Now my next step looking spectacular
And that right there is a blessing
Truest evil when this shit go wrong, don't stress it
'Cause sometime the universe testing you

Everyday is sunshine

Fade those lights, paid that price and did it
Overnight when we shoot that dice
And I'll probably fly, play that game and did it
Hustle from the bottom and get it
Get this money then flip it

Louboutin, foreign cash, hundred dollars on my kite
Hundred dollars on my flight, hundred G's every night

問題是人們在這時候是要走還是留誰都放不下
卻只有我緊緊握住一個撥出的電話

我說話沒重點　一句話說三遍
可是妳明白　我還有些眷念
揮霍的時間　對妳的依戀
不就代表我　身為人的極限

一切都在變化　在那些陰暗的地方
人性漸漸散漫　活著只求好玩

我的人生追求　絕對的感受
世界走到盡頭　還有一些收穫
留著一朵玫瑰　在妳的枕頭
不問後不後悔　這一刻最美

The nights in Bennett Park blasting Big Pun tapes
I'm 'a miss this place, to tell you the truth:
Kevin dispensin' wisdom from his dispatch booth
And at dawn, Vanessa at the salon, we gotta move on
But who's gonna notice we're gone?

When our job's done, as the evening winds
Down to a crawl, son, can I ease my mind
When we're all done? When we've resigned
In the long run, what do we leave behind?

So now I’m facing (Aaron Burr) with his own faction

He’s very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

Deliberation (Non-stop)

I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel

Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent
Call your first witness
That’s all you had to say

Okay
One more thing

Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom (aww)

Why do you write like you’re running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re running out of time?
Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re running out of time

Keep on fighting
In the meantime
Non-stop

Corruption’s such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony’s economy’s increasingly stalling and
Honestly, that’s why public service
Seems to be calling me (he’s just non-stop)

I practiced the law, I practic’ly perfected it
I’ve seen injustice in the world and I’ve corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I’ll be Socrates

Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities (aww)

Hamilton, at the constitutional convention

I was chosen for the constitutional convention

There as a New York junior delegate

Now what I’m going to say may sound indelicate (aww)

Goes and proposes his own form of government (what?)

His own plan for a new form of government (what?)	 
 
Talks for six hours
The convention is listless

Bright young man

Yo, who the f is this?

Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev’ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies

Why do you write like it’s
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it’s
Going out of style?	 

Ev’ry day you fight like it’s
Going out of style
Do what you do

Alexander?

Aaron Burr, sir

It’s the middle of the night

Can we confer, sir?

Is this a legal matter?

Yes, and it’s important to me

What do you need?

Burr, you’re a better lawyer than me

Okay

I know I talk too much, I’m abrasive
You’re incredible in court
You’re succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense
You’re the solution

Who’s your client?

The new U.S. Constitution?

No

Hear me out

No way

A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public
No one will read it

I disagree

And if it fails?

Burr, that’s why we need it

The constitution’s a mess

So it needs amendments

It’s full of contradictions

So is independence
We have to start somewhere

No
No way

You’re making a mistake

Good night

Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for? (what?)

We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

Of course

Then defend it

And what if you’re backing the wrong horse?

Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don’t understand how you stand to the side

I’ll keep all my plans
Close to my chest (wait for it, wait for it, wait)

I’ll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I’m taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow	 

I am sailing off to London
I’m accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there’s no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

Angelica

Don’t forget to write

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays 
Defending the new United States constitution
Entitled The Federalist papers
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays
The work divided evenly among the three men
In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months
John Jay got sick after writing five
James Madison wrote twenty-nine
Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one

How do you write like you’re
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re
Running out of time?

Ev’ry day you fight
Like you’re
Running out of time
Like you’re
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?	 
 
How do you write like tomorrow won’t arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev’ry second you’re alive?
Ev’ry second you’re alive? Ev’ry second you’re alive?

They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I’m asking you to be my right hand man

Treasury or State?

I know it’s a lot to ask

Treasury or State?

To leave behind the world you know

Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

Treasury

Let’s go

Alexander

I have to leave

Alexander

Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

Lin-Manuel Miranda,"Mister President, you asked to see me

I know you're busy

What do you need, sir

Sir
I wanna give you a word of warning

Sir, I don't know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

You're kidding

I need a favor

Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior

Shh, talk less

I'll use the press
I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him

I need you to draft an address

Yes, he resigned, you can finally speak your mind

No, he's stepping down so he can run for President

Ha, good luck defeating you, sir

I'm stepping down, I'm not running for President

I'm sorry, what

One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let's take a break tonight
And then we'll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

No, sir, why

I wanna talk about neutrality

Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time

I want to warn against partisan fighting

But

Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard won wisdom I have earned

As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

No, one last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We're gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I

Mister President, they will say you're weak

No, they will see we're strong

Your position is so unique

So I'll use it to move them along

Why do you have to say goodbye

If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I'm gone
Like the scripture says
Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid
They'll be safe in the nation we've made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we've made
One last time

One last time

Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration
I am unconscious of intentional error
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects 
Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors
I shall also carry with me

The hope
That my country will
View them with indulgence
And that
After forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
The faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion
As I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat 
In which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking
In the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart
And the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers	

One last time

George Washington's going home

I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British

Huh

I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

Yes?

Well

Have I done something wrong, sir?

On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

Sir?

Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

Sir

Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you

To be their Secretary? I don’t think so

Why’re you upset?

I’m not

It’s alright, you want to fight, you’ve got a hunger

Living is harder

Schuyler?

My sister

Number two

He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I’ll leave you to it

Number three

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, I’m fine
She’d be lying

But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life

To the groom (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)

To the bride (to the bride, to the bride)

From your sister (Angelica, Angelica)

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide (you provide, you provide)

May you always (always)

Be satisfied (be satisfied)

And I know

She’ll be happy as

His bride
And I know

He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied",Satisfied,2015
Lin-Manuel Miranda,"There's nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There's trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander's by himself, I'll let him tell it

I hadn't slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan more in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That's when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said

I know you are a man of honor
I'm so sorry to bother you at home
But I don't know where to go, and I came here all alone

She said

My husband's doin' me wrong
Beatin' me, cheatin' me, mistreatin' me
Suddenly he's up and gone
I don't have the means to go on

So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

You're too kind, sir

I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said

This one's mine, sir

Then I said, well, I should head back home
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said

Stay

Hey

Hey

That's when I began to pray
Lord, show me how to say no to this
I don't know how to say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body's saying, hell, yes

Whoa

No, show me how to say no to this

I don't know how to say no to this

In my mind, I'm tryin' to go (go, go, go)

Then her mouth is on mine, and I don't say

No, no (say no to this)
No, no (say no to this)
No, no (say no to this)
No, no (say no to this)

I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time, it became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said

Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to (fuuuu)

Uh oh, you made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein' my whore wife
If the price is right, if not I'm telling your wife

I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed how could you in her face, she said

No, sir

Half dressed, apologetic, a mess, she looked pathetic, she cried

Please don't go, sir

So was your whole story a setup

I don't know about any letter (stop crying God dammit, get up)

I didn't know any better (I am ruined)

Please don't leave me with him helpless (I am helpless how could I do this?)
Just give him what he wants and you can have me (I don't want you, I don't want you)

Whatever you want, if you pay	 

You can stay (Lord, show me how to say no to this)
I don't know how to say no to this
'Cause the situation's helpless

And her body's screaming, hell, yes

No, show me how to say no to this (whoa)
How can I say no to this
There is nowhere I can go (go, go, go)

When her body's on mine I do not say (no) yes

Say no to this

(Yes) say no to this (no)

(Yes) say no to this (no)

(Yes) say no to this (no)

Say no to this I don’t say no to this
There is nowhere I can go (go, go, go)

Try not to crack under the stress, we're breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don't print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs 'em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askin' for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I'll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and crack it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

It must be nice, it must be nice

It must be nice, it must be nice

The ink hasn't dried
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

So he's doubled the size of the government
Wasn't the trouble with much our previous government size

And making American credit competitive

Somebody has to stand up for the South

Somebody has to stand up to his mouth

You can't put it out from inside the house

I'm in the cabinet, I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin' at power and kissin' it

Lin-Manuel Miranda,"The issue on the table
A petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia 
Calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms
This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin
It cannot go ignored. 
If this comes to a vote in Congress
What is the White House's position? 
Secretary Jefferson, you first
Tread lightly

Sir
The constitution clearly states
That the states have to wait
Until eighteen-oh-eight to debate
On whether to end the slave trade
And whether or not you want it, guys
That is the final compromise we made

Sir wait

But for a second let us say that we can legislate
Unanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great
We cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate
So back to Africa or do they get a separate state?
In 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West
My notion didn't get a single vote
Slavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer
But we can't address the question if we do not have an answer

Is it my turn? Good
Plantation states are packed with promise makers
Do you realize the precious time these legislators wasted?
Institutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles
Wait till the 1800's, and their population doubles
You all know
This is the stain on our soul and democracy
A land of the free? No, it's not, it's hypocrisy
To subjugate, dehumanize a race, call 'em property
And say that we are powerless to stop it, can you not foresee?
Sir, even you, you have hundreds of slaves
Whose descendants will curse our names when we're safe in our graves
How will the South find labor for its businesses?
How will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses?

How dare you

Yet still, people follow like lemmings
All your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings

That's enough

Well you asked how I feel
I don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real

If I may, Mr. President?
Madison?
Let's take this moment to establish a precedent
First of all, sir, we won't involve you in this
Imagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous
I'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year
That was agreed upon
That buys us time and assuages fear
I'll tell the North that on January 1st
Of that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst
Once I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen
And introduce a motion never to discuss this again

Mr. President!

Hamilton, if we support emancipation
Every single slave owner will demand compensation
And as for slandering Jefferson with talk of mistresses
Do you really wanna

Do you really wanna have that conversation?

No

Madison, execute your plan to the letter
Let's hope the next generation thinks of something better",Cabinet Battle 3 (Demo),2016

""These are the times that try men's souls
The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will
In this crisis, shrink from the service of their country
But he that stands by it now
Deserves the love and thanks of man and woman
Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered
Yet we have this consolation with us
That the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph""

I am seeing the best minds of my generation
Waste away in pestilence and starvation
Is this all a test or have we met our doom?
Have we set a camp of parameters for our tomb?

I have never seen His Excellency so despondent
So I've taken over writing all his correspondence
I have written Congress and received dishonest responses
I am beyond comprehension of their nonsense

They say, saddle up! Attack the British forces!
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

Sixty tents full of dysentery, death
Dying breaths and dilettantes and deserters in the distance
Congress, I beg of you, justify your existence
Are you men or just a bunch of indigenous infants?
Unite these states, give them stakes in our resistance
Do you have no influence at all, you fucking skinflints?

Hamilton, tone it down

But sir!

Alex, listen, there’s only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright
Don’t engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

Lin-Manuel Miranda,"I wrote my way out
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Running on empty, with nothing left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen
And wrote my way out (I wrote my way out)

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power, just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens

And I wrote my way out (I wrote my way out)

I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was I sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin'
""Oh, you think you smart? Blah! Start bleedin'""
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, pssh, you'll get 'em right back
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
Damn, you got no chill, fuckin' right I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out

I wrote my way out
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)
Cause I wrote my way out

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the projects
Wrote-wrote my way out of the projects

(Verse 1)
I got a master plan knocking these bum broads outta my way
Just came in the door and they got somethin to say
Tell em step up if they want to act hard
I don't need no great big bodyguard
Only dump dimes when it's time to blaze the L
You can do it just as long as you don't hurt ya self
Pull up, hop out start spitting like the A.R.
1-5 cake or sky high oh my
Got the science and the formula for hatin chicks
And whatcha do, if you don't like me you can suck a dick
I'm smoother then a pair of lizard skins in '88
A lotta suckas portrayin us when we know they ain't
Get the fuck outta here your dealin with a rider here
The chef in hell's kitchen, I'm stayin here for  alotta years
And for my thugs, real bitches and all my hustlers
Keep it movin I ain't got no paitence for you bustas (DO IT)

Step up if you want to get hurt
Ms. Jade's gonna pull your skirt (oh)
Step up if you want to get hurt

Now I don't mean to be rude cocky and arrogant
I Guess that's just the PHILLY in me, and I don't even care
I Guess that's just the PHILLY in me, and I ain't even scared
This rap game is a war and I done came prepared
It ain't nothin to me to just pack up and leave
but why shouldn't I give it every breath that I breathe
And why shouldn't I kill it every time that I leave
When these fake mutha fucka's is so easy to read 'cause
My family got needs, my city need me
So I'mma do it from the muscle bitch believe me
Think 'cause I'm with Tim that I got it easy
but that don't stop me from smoking up in the Crown V
Stayin sucka free, weed in the truck with me
This music biz keep a bitch puffin heavily
3 in the mornin listening to Frankie Beverly
I won't stop till the whole world lovin me (DO IT)

(Verse 3)
You can Cha Cha Cha to this mardi gras
I'm the sickest rap bitch you done heard thus far
And it will get be-tta I'm bout my che-dda
and no one gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing whether 2003 swing
or I'm poppin that thing thing and lockin the game mane
won't fuck up my game plan, dealin the same hand
Just getting started and I'm only getting hotta mane
So getcha feet into the heat start lurkin

Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,
Give me the simple life.",Walking (Interlude),2005

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Für diese richtig dünnen Worte hast du richtig fett geübt

Lina Luna,"El mundo seria aburrido y triste sin colores
Sin el arcoiris que pinta las flores
Sin el cielo azul y las nubes rojas
Sin el verde vida que pinta las hojas
El mundo seria aburrido y triste sin colores
Hay colores de piel, colores de ojos colores de pelo

Colores, colores
Pero el mismo color nos pinta por dentro 
Los mismo colores en los sentimientos
El mundo seria aburrido sin nuestros colores
Tantos niños de colores tantos sueños e ilusiones
Colores colores

Tantas sonrisas brillantes
Tantos pequeños gigantes
Colores, colores
El nudo seria aburrido sin nuestros colores

Que quieren separarnos a todos por nuestros colores
Y hasta pelean guerras y son mala gente con 
Todos los que tiene la piel diferente

Lina Nyberg,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,

Well sir, all I can say is

Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra,"""I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms

I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames.
And when it was all over I said to myself,

I had the feeling that something was missing.

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Lincoln Mayorga,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,1995
Lincoln Mayorga,"Some say, ""Love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""

Some say, ""Love, it is a a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love, it is a flower
And you it's only seed""

It's the heart that fears breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one, who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Life's the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose

I guess he's back 'urr dirty, s-t-l derby
I'm like magic to Kareem, man you tell me I ain't worthy
I ain't speaking 'bout a jersey, I'm speaking 'bout income
Did you hear that Elizabeth? here come the big one!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a general custard
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer, in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Superbowl, with Julius Peppers
I got that can't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they can't stop, won't stop, screaming the name
Nelly! Nelly! go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'ma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'ma fight to the end
Let's go

[Chorus]
Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring coming
It's the blood of a champion, pumping
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be running
I'ma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothing
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a) in me

I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playing for his hometown, repping for the home ground
And getting buffer like Michael Riggs, tell 'em again
I gets buffer like Michael Riggs, heard what I said?
The m-v-p of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shooting out from my reign, with Peyton Manning type aim
Can't stop me from scoring so they results are just hacking
So there's, three of us now,- me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been raven about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin' or if I'm sittin' and readin'
Waitin' for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a brick, man
Ain't no way they blow, know, ain't no way they can, know
Ain't no way they can, know, ain't no way they can, know

[Chorus]

It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin' what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin'
I've been dogfightin', scratchin' and clawin' on every height
I'm gonna to make you remember me like you 'Remember The Titans'
Cause I'm a warr-ior, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young black and rich
As good as it gets, and givin' your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh
