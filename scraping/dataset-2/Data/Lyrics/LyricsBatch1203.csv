Tkay Maidza,"We make it up and you stay
If I break the rules that you play
Tell me that you want it, tell me there's no need to show it
But you don't see what I see, you never will
What's it about, all the same
I let it flow and you play
Hide it if I wanted, don't need you to make me honest
'Cause the trouble that will follow is unreal

I said hey, hey, living on the run
Pulling at the strings 'til the lights turn on
It's too late, living on the run
But they're staring at the wall
'Cause I said hey, hey, living on the run
Pulling at the strings 'til the lights turn on
It's too late, living on the run
But they're staring at the wall

'Cause I keep moving, I keep moving, I keep moving along
And will you be here when we start finding what we're searching for
'Cause I keep moving, I keep moving, I keep moving along

Stuck in the simulation

We all seem to find the way
I never share to keep safe
He said there's no other way but I'm not standing in the shade
I'm running 'round circles got me everything they say
When time is up and they pay
They too left, they'll say
Give us what you got 'cause we have everything you want
And we are ready for it reaching for the top

Building up on my walls, looking greater than China
I took my time on this, my hands getting so brighter
I try to widen my brain, the body's getting so wider
Same story, same games playing, except it change ways
And they always sample our music in different pieces
Ducking, woddle, I'm finding my reason, thesis 
Little did they know, I see what's real and what's in their mind
I can tell that you do not care

Where did everybody go?
I'm still standing on my own
Basking in the afterglow

Where did everybody go?
Quick they come and fast they go
I'm still standing on my own
Wait too long you'll miss the outro

I'm shifting the gears
I'm clearing all the angles
Told you that you should watch, now my zone has no tangles
Now bright as the day, their talking is ample
They said I was falling off till I left them hanging like bangles

(Why they?) Saying numbers, they never move the ball
(Why they?) Picture places i see them hot and cold
(What they think) Isn't real they were out when it was told
They doing chinese whispers telling tales to fit the mold

Where did everybody go?

I'm still standing on my own
Basking in the afterglow

Where did everybody go?
Quick they come and fast they go
I'm still standing on my own
Wait too long you'll miss the outro

I'll take advantage, land on these people, they in Atlantis
They pray for magic I just be in it, straight edge not manic
Panic, sheep they panic
Look for light in the stables, might have to show the diff
I'm moving up the cable

I've seen it, seen it and been frustrated -strated
Focused only, attention will not be catered
Save it, save it, seeing, seeing no one
I go in
I'm super saiyan, never playing, they blaming
Can't contain it, if I'm rested, it's looking dangerous

Chances you can find me's a needle right in the haystack
Too busy looking up they're coming at me with payback
If you're not making sense then come back when you have status
And keep it quiet

Yes, I'm a self-made disaster
But there won't be anyone after
They'll look at my name and they will see my reign and they'll want to experience rapture

They comin' but this a new chapter
And this ain't no ark I revive than I shatter
I'm haunting these niggas like my name is Casper
And they'll say my name until you're calling a pastor

If this was a race would you catch up?

Question my thoughts am I really alone?
Been here since day one and this is the sum
I bet when people see me they stick on like gum

Checking my list because I have in mind
Chasing beyond what is seen at this time
They over the moon but they seem to forget
The time is what matters and then getting it right

When I work and I work all these people they search for
They wrong they don't get that I'm really rehearsed
Seen all their words and it really gets cloudy
These people can't use what I've been in their sound

(Huh)

Soon, I'll be dropping my cards
And everything else that has happened so far
Because they were wrong when they said I was timed

But they wrong, but they wrong
But they wrong like, they wrong

Tell 'em, sit and listen
I'm never sitting with them
They get mad and watch me glisten
Like what these people give 'em?
They livin' on hope but they can't even cope with inner dopeness
Rap tracks and I leave 'em hopeless
Cut 'em up like guillotines and leave 'em soulless
Got a couple thousand, ask me if I wrote this
Like them lost kitties with no pennies, they can blow this

Alright
Tell 'em where I get this offsight
Spitting on this world and it be setting on fire
I do it 'cause I never wanna line up up
For a dumb-dumb, inner slum job for hire

I haven't even warmed up, there's sweaters
No one can tell me where this even get us
These residents already getting jealous
'Cause they're noticing I'm only getting better
Seen the forecast and now I'm ready for the weather

I be, independent, I be doing it free, I do it for me
I get it from my parents G E-netics

Yo, fuck the dick, where the pennies though?
Sweating, I let him lick all on me
But don't love him though, ew
Fuck the rich, where the grinders though?
All about the looks, ass, titties, ass, cars and their money, clothes

Fuck a diss, let's be friends though
Niggas gotta dream but they only seen in the same stream
When you're on it they be hiding though
When it comes real clean then you'll know I'll be all in the other zone

Sailing the sea
But they're saline I see
'Cause I'm getting the bread for my table oui, oui

Why must we learn it the hard way 
And play the game of life with our hearts? 
I gave you my life, you gave me your life. 
Like a gush of wind in my hair. 
Why do we forget what's been said 
And play the game of life with our hearts?

I would doubt it as to callin' a bluff
But unlike you I wouldn't breaka da rules

I'd eat a steak and potato while thinkin' it over later
Leave a tip two quarters and a condom for the waiter
What to do

So we can talk it through and through
Because it ain't nothin' better than talkin' to me
When you want to know somethin'
Than havin' to get a piece of info from who knows
I'm gettin' fed up yo 'cause
Words become a quote or somethin' better like a story
It's far from okey doke close to fiction
Half is true but then the other is a conviction
So I'm blamed with an infliction
From which others have created
Then have socially debated
So you don't you know that the story's been inflated

You know you shouldn't fall for everything that they tell you
Unless you get it straight from the horse's mouth (hey)

You can talk to me, you can talk to me
If it's somethin' you want to know (something you want to know)
Then just ask me baby
Ooh so tenderly (so tenderly)
I'll tell you what you want to hear (I'll tell you somethin')
You can talk to your girl
I won't lie to you baby

Remember don't let anyone come between you

Now throw a log on the fire
Then we could trim the tree
How much fun it would be
To take a walk in the snow
As you're holding me close
That would be your christmas gift to me

[Chorus]

Maybe it ain't got nothin' to do
With my 2 front teeth
Not unless of course you're lookin'
For some chewed up beef

See I love ya 'cause I'm in love
And in love 'cause I love ya
These words and sentences is for the heads
Between and above ya

Can you imagine me alone
A dial tone
A two flips cone
The echo of a moan

A single bow
A measly dug it
A pea in the bucket
Flat out for Christmas all I want to do is (yow)

Maybe if my baby didn't treat me like a lady
Just the hose for my toes
Kiss the spot that's mostly shady
Twist the left all around

Flips these lips upside down
Then you'll never have to ask me why I'm crazy
So hear me in or hear me out
Give me deaf or give me doubt

Or tell me what it's all about
And if you figure out my flow
Be it fast or be it slow
Me and my baby will be chillin' with the mistletoe

Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all

Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel
Like there's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

A-yo, if we could all agree
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And distress on my back with them cats
They be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's cause I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon
As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel
Like there's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

Now I lay me down to sleep
That was then, but this is now
I pray the lord my soul to keep
I let you slip away somehow
If I should die before I wake
If I should die my pain shall stay
I pray the lord my soul to take
I made you what you are today

Now as I look at myself I'm seein' someone familiar
Starin' back at me through every deep crack that's in my mirror
And as I think to myself
I'm hearin somebody else scream at me (shhh....)
I no longer hear from
Could it be the unknown
Sneaking into my zone
Off we roam
My spirituals is not alone
I'm visualizing this invisible clone
It's my own and it's own
Rest assured it's my dome
Maybe I need to go to bed
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head
Nots while I raps
When it hits me (ha ha ha ha....)
But now it's laughin at me
Yo what the hell is happenin'
Please somebody slap me
No way not another physical display
Somethin' must got me backin' off from way back in tha day
But what can it be
I can't recall the memories so if I may ask

I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday

By any means was all it ever seemed to be
This reminiscin' with my past has got me
Caught up in a daydream
Stay in bed with niggas who can pay tha rent
Spending my green on panty hose and tight jeans
I used to be so amused
Cause the tools that I used to break rules
Only seemed to confuse as to whose bein' abused
Place yourself in my shoes
My blessed look of innocence was never refused

Now that I choose to abide
Hello left eye
And put my past to the side
I don't guess I
And kill a piece of my pride
Need to introduce myself
You already said hi
Oh so your the match that lights my fuse
Amuse
Huh, I thought I left you on on that cruise
You lose it
Your man took my place when it threw me in your face
So we drank up all the booze

Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

They still wouldn't comprehend
The depth between me and you

We play the same rules
In a heartbeat a wiseman can be a fool
There's no guarantee that love will be

A stranger or a friend
A prayer that's answered 
Or a heartache that never ends
Through the darkest hours 
When all is said and done
It has the power
You go from lonely to the lucky one

Now matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days
You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Not long ago I got to know the lonely side
Just me and my pain and nowhere to hide
It amazes me
How my world turned around
If it's meant to be
That's all that matters to me anyhow

Found something in your pocket and I don't know why
I didn't say anything I just sat and cried
Got me twisted all out inside
Not too long before the next ride

Over and over and over again
Instead of lettin' it out
I always let it in
This is where the confusion begins
?Cause if you don't make me you don't win

You're always on my case.

When the life it stops, nobody comes around,

You're doing fine,
Don't go too far,
Don't cross the line.
Don't push so hard.

Everything in life we know, 
We gotta learn by the chances we take.
If we don't give a damn about it we would never try to make away

Just be true about the way you feel,
'cause when its right you gotta keep it real.
And that's why I say.

Nobody can, nobody knows,
But when you don't, it shows,
The way that you live defies the truth,
But the way that you feel about your life reflects on you.

It was swangin' oh
Till somethin' turned me off
I wasn't sure
Could of swore I saw you with someone
And at much to my surprise (whoa)

[Chorus]
You were right there with your hands up in the air
You had hoochies everywhere
All on you
It's like I almost didn't know you
Tryin' to shake that ass
Playa you don't even dance
Sup wit' you
It's like I don't even know you

Left you at the crib
Cause I know you get your game on
Happens every Tuesday night
You said that you was cool
Your boys was comin' by
(go baby have yourself a real good time)
So I knew I could be wrong

I was thinkin' there's no way it could be you
Not my baby
He ain't crazy no
Then my girlfriends tipped me off
When I got closer I could tell that it was you
You was bangin'
You was swangin' oh

[Chorus: x2]

Mindin' my own business
My pager's goin' off
My girlfriends tryin' to tell me
You're doin' wrong
I needed confirmation
I knew you was a dog
I just can't believe what I saw

Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body layin' cold in the gutter, listen to me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place, y'all, don't hear me

I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and joined
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray, all ten fade away seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional
Skies have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps them in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tootin' caine into your own vein
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane and ain't this day and time for fallin'
Prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

Lets go

Nobody never understood be better
A true friend forever
That's why I'm writing you this love letter
Despite my ways through every phase
You brought me better days
Withstood the craze
From the beginning Windy hill the black Lennon
When I was saggin denim, and let you get up in em'
Until I damage when I select it
Another ni**a but we managed to stay connected
When you expected to see me naked
I couldn't let it five years and your still respected
Now check it, give me a second to unwind
You'll find all the pain and misery that nearly blew my mind
Cant no fame and shivery compare to losing time
I'll explain my history aboard the cools at nine
Don't be late, cuz I would hate to cross the seven seas
In the windy breeze, without your fantasies

Tell them haters that mad they cant do it like I do it
They used to call me fat, they used to say I'm ugly
But now im making records, groupies screaming that they love me
I got them dolla bills, I make a lot of cheese
Bet your bi**h cant do it like me
And when you see me in the club I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the street I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the town I'm lookin' fresh
I got my hair and my nails done and I'm so fresh

Through sunshine or the rainiest weather
And no matter what it will always be us together

I said if I got nothing else
I got memories of what we felt
I sit alone laughing to myself
Sometimes, about it
Those silly reasons we would fight
No, no matter who was wrong or right
We will always there
Sharing this love, sharing this life

'Cause we knew, said we always knew
And no matter what would've come
That we were
Meant to be

And it ain't going to be easy
And no matter what baby we're meant to be
We ain't never had known if
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

And though it will get dark sometimes we know
Everyone now and then it's got to rain
But when that rain starts to pound
All you gotta do is turn around
And you'll find me right there
Holding you up, holding you down

'Cause we knew, said we always knew
And no matter what would've come
That we were
Meant to be

And it ain't going to be easy
And no matter what baby we're meant to be
We ain't never had known if
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

From the moment we met
Meant to be
Through the sorrow, through the stress
Meant to be through life and through death
Hey we've built a love that nothing can test
Meant to be

And it ain't going to be easy
And no matter what baby we're meant to be
We ain't never had known if
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

And it ain't going to be easy

On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back
And it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking
Not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch
That them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down

Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)

We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

How much fun it would be
To take a walk in the snow
As you're holding me close
That would be your christmas gift to me

Not unless of course you're lookin'
For some chewed up beef

And in love 'cause I love ya

Between and above ya

A two flips cone
The echo of a moan

A single bow
A measly dug it
A pea in the bucket
Flat out for Christmas all I want to do is (yow)

Maybe if my baby didn't treat me like a lady
Just the hose for my toes
Kiss the spot that's mostly shady
Twist the left all around

Flips these lips upside down
Then you'll never have to ask me why I'm crazy
So hear me in or hear me out
Give me deaf or give me doubt

Or tell me what it's all about
And if you figure out my flow
Be it fast or be it slow
Me and my baby will be chillin' with the mistletoe

On sait qui tient les rênes
Qui sur la planète rap règnent
J'tente une tentative de boycott
C'est T.L.F. qu'ils craignent
Mon envie de percer vient du fait qu'ils s'plaignent
Ajoutes-y le cash, limite j'gâche ma vie si j'ai pas les poches pleines
Qui font les durs qu'une fois le chargeur plein le vide
Qui assume sa peine, s'retrouve pas les deux pieds dans le vide
Qui la ramène, ayant grandit, en bave, qui encaisse qui en bave,
Les barrières elles sont derrières vu qu'aujourd'hui j'les brave
Qui prend trop à coeur cette musique
Qui oublie qu'c'est une passion et c'qui nous divise c'est le fric ! (Ikbal : C'est le fric !)
À c'que j'vois l'officialité est plein d'conflits
Quand j'cours après l'oseille j'ai toujours affaire à ces cons de flics
En cas d'embrouilles, qui est derrière ?
On sait qui, qui brouille les pistes, qui kiffe mon concept, qui
C'est qui, qui en scred nous bombent, derrière le micro jouent les durs,
Dans la rue me cirent les pompes

R.O.H. 2 F, yes
T.L.F., yes
Serrez les fesses
Tu sais qu'on les baise
Trop d'flow (flow flow) ça part comme de la schnouf

Tu nais seul, tu crèves seul
Y'a pas de linceul ou d'cercueil pour deux
J'fais partis d'ces mecs qui sont sur d'eux
Des potes j'en ai peu comme l'oseille
Mon magnum est orgueilleux donc vas-y garde tes conseils
Ils viendront à ton mariage mais pas à ton enterrement,
On te ment, sincèrement, donc j'm’en bats les couilles de vos serments (ouais)
2007 : j'reste sur mes gardes même si on sait qui est qui,
Qui fait quoi, qui fait du bruit pour rien, qui s'débrouille bien, qui a l'bras long sur l'terrain Qui
bouge pour moi sans s'poser d'questions
Les furieux qui parlent de ram'ner les daronnes en rançon
Dans l'ghetto on sait qui bouffe les galeux qui, qui jacte sur l'autre qui ,
Qui a l'culot d'ouvrir sa gueule devant n'importe qui
La crainte d'Allah nous fortifie
J'm'agenouille que sur l'tapis (wallah)

Maintenant on sait qui a oublié ses couilles dans l'ventre de sa mère !

Fume un mec pour moi et notre amitié sera proportionnelle
Pire qu'un crime passionnel quand tu trahis ton ami
On sait c'qui peut fuck une famille

Qui fait la bringue, qui vit pour la frime, les meufs et les flingues

Qui boycotte ma réuss-ITE, qui pense que j'le mér-ITE
On sait qui veut faire comme qui, qui suce qui, qui fait l'chaud sous whisky,

Le biff appelle le biff quand tu marches droit
Les choix sont décisifs, m'arrêter je n'ai pas le droit
Le parcours est physique, de plus en plus explicite

Stay fresh like Doug, I run with the thugs
That'll cut your throat and sell your blood
Fifty/fifty love around the border
Should be bidding five to fifteen
On the Strength for the way I manslaughter
Rock your girl's boat like the Titanic
Man, I got more numbers than the Ninex, plus the Bell Atlantic
More hoes than forty-deuce
More clothes than twenty cleptos could boost
I'm not having it
I bring it to your label, producer and your management
Man, I'm like the Feds, I bring down your establishment
Under the Rico, I purchased my 3rd quarterly from Bob Cito
Got your block locked like the Dred, Mike Z and Chino
You know (What? What?)

[T.M.F.]
Look me eye-to-eye and see what you find
A crime nigga, nine spitter, mind digga, refined
Power impact, cracking your spine, mankind
Blow off the surface like landmines in my pastime
I saw it all, had plenty broads
Cut your wig short like Demi Moore
Ghost, vanished, most motherfuckers don't know I'm half spanish
Hazardous lyrical tactics, pinned to the mattress like canvas
Get your ass kicked for talking backwards
Puffin Backwoods, walking through the back of the hood
No protection, Stapleton section
Corrupt life, T.M.F. arch style, we rush mic's
Disarmed for that gold-piece charm
Red alert, we all alarmed, ready for combat
No contact, counting backwards ten-to-one
Now let me launch that, no way you can catch my format
I'm like the Gingerbread Man, moving on land
Catch me if you can, I move faster than the average man

[Chorus: x2 Shyheim]
You only got one life to live
So all of my children, it's better to give than receive
Life is short, Days of Our Lives seem to speed
Still waiting for the day when Clinton legalize weed

[Dom PaChino a.k.a. P.R. Terrorist]
It's like gun play when my darts spray
Leave you scarred today, mental washed away
I shoot like Hardaway, your body parts decay
Slow-lay, too busy lusting the Rol-ay, platinum face
I snatch you over-arms, I take you out of space
Take you into my orbit, Terrorist gone corporate
Chopping tracks into sawdust, son, so you could snort it
In the conference room, Terrorist Hymn coming soon
Album cover pitch-black like the sky, without the moon
To illuminate, in my dome-piece there lies a metal plate
Titanium, harder than a lock in your gate
Burglarize your enterprise and have fun with your mate
Cause I'm not nasty, when doing my dirt, won't see ya masta me
Silent Weapons is a classic like Freddy Bassey
What a word pro, electro, grenade logo
Forever show how I firmly handle the phono
Bitches lust me, my plans of wetting the seeds in the mo-mo
Terrorist relating to Shy, mi vida loco (I feel the same way)

[T.M.F. #2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Eh yo, treasury, stacking this paper for Longevity
The money first, put it in work, that be my pedigree
Let's take it to higher degree
Sit back and visualize so our eyes could see
Black God, we living hard
Mugs get scarred, thugs get barred
Treated like slaves in the yard
Playing the field, most niggas tell and squeal
That's why I move for 'self, only me and my steel
Cause shit is real and leary niggas will rat you out
Get under pressure by the jakes when they smack 'em out
Gat in they mouth, for talking, you sleep-walking
Can't play the street often, become a victim for extortion
For your fortune, your bank rose
Stank hoes, you think I ain't cold?
Run up in your crib, take everything, even the sink goes
You sweat like a pink rose
Can you smell it, when you soft like velvet?
Catch one up in your helmet, get dealt wit
On the quick-fast, take you on a great adventure like Six Flags
Spent every day of my life just trying to get cash
So when my shit blasts
Duck behind buildings for shelter, or you'll get hit fast
Catch whiplash, fucking wit Trife, you must've skipped class
Your bitch-ass didn't take notes, infra-red scope beaming

But keep an open eye for them cats who stay scheming",One Life to Live,1999

Fine with them, such a quite din
Says he wants to leave a while
She just sits and tries to smile
""That's ok, it was boring anyway""

Too long, too late this time
Too far, too great in my mind

Says she needs a worshiper
Someone who'll do anything at all for her

Each one misses by so far
They don't see it come, but who ever does",Jam,1992

I find my brother in there
Deep in my heart
I find my brother in there
Hold in my arms
I love you
And if I seem too quiet now
There are no words
To tell you how
I love you

I often feel
Like the prodigal son
Take all I need
Giving back none

In such different ways
You're like the light behind the fog
So soft
But still you burn my eyes away

And so much has happened these years
But still I find that you
Are waiting here

There are no words to show you how
I love you",Brother,1993

Are you second sight
Are you older than your life
Eighty days of sorrow
Endless more in sight
Still you child burn bright

And you see me crying again
And you hold out your little hand
Lead me shaking to his room
I thought I'd never see again

Close the door behind you
Turning out the light
Press a flashlight up against the wall
You say this is how we knew him, in a little egg
It opened up and this is daddy now

Now you're stepping back towards me
Til the room is bathing in light

Are you breathing now inside me

He was crowing for repair
You'd give him love and affection
But you couldn't keep him there

While you were sleeping with the angels
He was under the bed
And the more skin

That you shed
The more that the air in your throat will linger
When you call him your friend

Staring at a cold little hand
Reading fault lines
Of a shell of a man

Forget the words that once rang so true

To stop the flood of warmth before it even starts

So many times that my memories are worn

Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

Toby Keith,"My neighbor Carl, he lives next door
Pink flamingos on his porch
At night he teaches driving school
And he sits out by his plastic pool
He takes off his shirt, he opens up a cold one
Ol' Carl Dean's a fool, but it takes one to know one

Music's playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian, blues, country, folk and southern rock
It's a little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There's always something going on down in the trailerhood

Across the street there's gambling James
Always got the poker game
If you care to try your luck
You can buy a seat for fifteen bucks
You can call to raise
Or you can check and fold 'em
I like five card stud,
But it's mostly Texas hold 'em

Music's playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian, blues, country, folk and southern rock
It's a little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There's always something going on down in the trailerhood

My new tattoos and farmer tans,
Rodeo and NASCAR fans
Dallas Cowboys football on t.v.
When the storm starts getting bad
You hear those sirens humming
Grab a six pack and a lawn chair
There's a tornado coming

Alright

Toby Keith,"I was getting kinda tired
Of her endless chatter
Nothing I could say
Ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive
Just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead
It looked like a place
To find some satisfaction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

I paid the man at the door
And pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink
Over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool
Tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen
To a word he said
I knew somewhere
Amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
If you please
A lot more loving
Is what I need
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

Well she was fighting them off
At a corner table
She had a long neck bottle
She was peeling the label
The look on her face
It was perfectly clear
She said somebody please
Get me out of here
The look she shot me
Through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
If you please
A lot more loving

Rigs came down and the money got spent
And the wisemen saved for a rainy day

For speeding and running red lights

Smoked cigarettes and tried the wine
Thought breakin' rules was bein' cool

It ain't cheating if you don't get caught
Jokers laugh and losers grieve
Cause out here there's no honor among thieves

That woman you've been loving, she was another man's
You stole her heart while his back was turned
On every corner there's an outlaw waiting

It's just too close to Christmas
And too far to go home

And there's gifts I just can't find
I walked her home and when she opened up her door
I'm not sure what happened then
Guess magic took it's course

She said, I know it's early, so I thought I'd let you sleep
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside

He was standin' at the front door givin' candy canes away
And I told him I was worried about a certain situation
How's Santa gonna get here with this risin' population

He said, I talked to the north pole sometime late last week
And it seems that dear ol' Santa has got somethin' up his sleeve
As I leaned in to listen, he whispered in my hear
He said, don't you dare repeat a single word of this, you hear

He said, boss man's all excited 'cause his new sled's almost ready
And they say he's got it painted up, looks just like Richard Petty's
And Rudolph and the reindeer, they're lookin' long and mean
It's the fastest, highest flyin' winter wonderland machine
I ain't seen it for myself, but I heard say
Santa Claus has got a hot rod sleigh

It's got a heater in the floorboard 'cause he's gettin' old, you know
And a windshield with the wipers should he happen on some snow
Landin' lights of red and white all stuck along the side
So he can spot the rooftops as he's fallin' from the sky

He's got a king-size toy bin, locks in all the latches
And a big old custom air seat with a safety belt that matches
Only thing about it that worries him a heap
Is that he might be here just long before the children get to sleep

Late last Christmas eve
Silent night, twinkling lights
Presents 'round the tree

Comin' down the stairs
She was sad as I looked over
Draggin' her teddy bear

She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message

Sometimes this time of year

So, with her head on my shoulder

Said, honey, what's the matter with her

There's nothin' wrong with her, she's perfect

I'm the one who made her cry

Could you please bring us two cups of coffee
We might be here for a while
Make mine black and hers sweet as sugar

A tender hand to fix it up
Its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
What my heart needs is a woman's touch

Are traces of the man I used to be
Late at night I hear it, it cannot be denied

And then cleaned up the mess
Now he is just a chip off of the old block Just like me we keep her on her toes a lot

When he laughs she'll grin from ear to ear

And I wrote your number
On the fifty yard line

You were always the perfect one
And a valedictorian

Call for a good time

But you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio

I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl

He never comes home and your always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall

I dare you to call me

A full-time job and part-time wife
And the grindstone just goes on and on
You're a lonely girl that's a lonely wife
Gotta three bedroom and an empty life
And you're not quite sure
Just where it all went wrong
There are lots of reasons why we should turn and walk away
But there's a whole lot ridin' on this love so baby what's ya say

Let's give it one good shot
Let's really give it all we got
We can take it nice and slow
Baby don't you want to go back
Where we had a chance
And we danced our dance
In a world where a heart could never shatter
We might go down cryin' 
But at least our love will die
Tryin' to matter, tryin' to matter

We've come a long way so don't forget
let's don't throw our hands up yet
We've still got time
To change our mind
Honey let's give it our best tonight
If we still ain't got it right
We can always, always say goodbye
Somewhere I guess we let go, lost a little ground
One solitary heartbeat can turn this thing around

Let's give it one good shot

Toby Keith,"Somebody told you that my broken heart started mending
I'm getting by, but the truth is that I'm still standing
Knee deep in yesterday's rain

Well I ain't high and dry, I ain't got a big boat
But I got a new umbrella and an overcoat
And if the good Lord's willing and the sun breaks through
That'll be one more day that I made it without you
That I made it without you

Two broken hearts, one goodbye kiss
Is this all that's left of me and you
You seem to take it all in stride
While I'm crumbling inside
Letting go is hard for me to do
But if all my love is easy to refuse
Then I guess you just don't have as much to lose

I'm as strong, strong as I can be
But ooh, ooh, ooh baby you leave me weak

Put my hands upon your skin
And it warms me to the touch
All that I can think about while we're makin' love
Is I'm the only one who knows how passionate you get
About all of our deepest little secrets that we've kept
As the night gets longer girl you just get stronger
And you pour yourself all over me
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby you leave me weak

And it always blows me away by the power that you hold
When the moment kicks in and the magic unfolds
And you wrap your love around me
And it brings me to my knees

A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree,
Round up all them bad boys hang them high in the street
For all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

Too much corruption, and crime in the streets

We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying
There's a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the army
Where he lost his right eye but he flew a flag out in our yard
Until the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy
In the land of the free

Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly
Through our big black eye

And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it's gonna be hell

And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue

Here in Oklahoma that means it is wintertime again 
Every time I think about the rain and sleet and snow 
I start dreamin' about siestas underneath this sombrero

Baby if you're good to go we'll go down to Mexico 
Get a place in Cabo, kick back in the sand 
It'll be just you and me and moonlight dancing on the sea 
To Spanish guitar melody of a mariachi band 

I got two tickets bought 
There won't be no second thought 
Weather's always nice down there in paradise 
We'll find that little man who owns that taco stand 
We'll be drinkin' margaritas while we're workin' on our tan

Toby Keith,"Just off of the two-lane where the school bus used to stop
Was a little wooden A-frame with a yellow tin roof top
One day it was raining on this world
She said ""have you ever really, really ever kissed a girl?""

Baby I'll be your Huckleberry, you don't have to double dare me
If the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
You're so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We'll grow up and we'll get married
I'm gonna be your Huckleberry

Later on that summer we went to the county fair
They had a brand new roller coaster and everyone was scared
It was two bucks to experience the thrill
She said ""come on boy let's get in line I'll ride it if you will""

Baby I'll be your Huckleberry, you don't have to double dare me
If the ride gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
You're so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We'll grow up and we'll get married
I'm gonna be your Huckleberry

Snuck off on a slow dance at the junior/senior prom
Went lookin' for some romance before I had to get her home
Steamin' up the windows of my car
She said ""until I get my wedding ring boy we can't go that far""

Baby I'll be your Huckleberry, you don't have to double dare me
If the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
You're so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries

Never worked in a white collar 
Never held a woman longer 
Than I held one single dollar

I know I'd piss right through it 

I can't remember ever wanting 
For one second of my life 
Even if I did it cost too much

ain't no secrets I have to tell

But it works for me 

I've been bent and bruised and broken 
And flat busted once or twice 
I brought most of it upon myself 
But I never compromised 

My pride's too hard to swallow 
So I've chewed a lot of it 
Mild-mannered and soft-hearted 
And hard-headed as you get 

I live out on the backroads 
Where I walk my country mile 
And if it's so good in the city 
Why don't anybody smile?

I can hear the sound of a vintage jukebox 
And smell the smoke of a hand-rolled cigar

I feel like I'm losing my touch

You were sitting by your lonesome

And your loneliness could not disguise
The beauty and the charm
Thought if I ever get you, shattered lady, in my arms

I'm gonna rock you baby to sleep
I'm gonna make you crazy over me
I'm gonna hold you like you've never been held before

Then I'm gonna love you all over and out of control
If this is how love is suppose to feel
Baby, I know I've fallen head over heels
I'm gonna rock you baby

Over open conversation and a bottle of red wine
You said this world is full of users and I know that I've had mine
We danced a little slow dance until they closed that cafe down
You said what would be the chances
That tonight I finally found someone who makes me feel like my life is just begun

Now our windshield's a painting that hangs in our room 
Changes with each mile like a radio tune 
We got up above, we'll make it on love 
Under the rodeo moon 

Sometimes we sleep in a hotel 
When we're ridin' that hot hand of luck 
Sometimes we crash at a friend's house 
Sometimes we just sleep in the truck

This no communication thing is quickly growing old
This isolation booth I'm in is dark and turning cold
I used to steal your breath away with just one little kiss

I'd catch moonlight in a bottle if we could drink a toast to happiness
Fill my pick-up bed with roses and back it right up to your door

Won't you hear what I say, give me a minute
Don't leave, I think I love you
I know you think I'm crazy, And you probably should
I wouldn't make this up, I couldn't dream this good

Now baby Don't tell me that I missed my chance
I haven't heard last call, would you like to dance?
I've been sitting here waiting on you all night
Why don't you give me that old good-to-go green light
Am I coming on strong, baby movin' kinda fast
I'm rushing along but at least I gotta ask
I couldn't live with myself if you got away
I'm a love sick puppy, baby what do you say?

[Chorus]

It's late and been a long night, you're tired I know
Aw, don't break my heart, baby please don't go
It Ain't the shikey talkin', ain't this neon light
You see I've fallen stone-cold in love at first sight
Gonna cut to the chase, baby get right to it
I got a lot to say and a short time to do it
Aw, Don't walk away honey I'm just trying to
Aw... listen to me talkin', I'm a babblin' fool

Toby Keith,"Me and JB and Sonny, we grew up on the buddy plan
Weren't we some bad mothers, closer than brothers
Had a rockin' little three-piece band
Yeah we wrote a lot of songs about women
Then we tried to sing 'em pretty for the girls
Pushin' everythin' we did to the limit
Livin' right out on the edge of the world.

I recall on summer night at a party 
We were sophomores hangin' out by the lake
I got off on some wine with a waitress
Sonny had a girlfriend that just couldn't wait
JB hooked up around midnight
With an ugly girl from up in the city
He downed every can of beer in the cooler
Just tryin' to drink that poor thing pretty.

Hey me and the boys we made a lot of noise
And we, sang all our songs for free
We partied through college, acquired some knowledge
Never did get a degree
We did it our way lookin' back on the good days
There's still not a lot I regret
Nights I Can't Remember, Friends I'll Never Forget.

I grew up and got married, took a job with the FPL
Sonny's got a good life, a baby and a good wife
And everyday he carries the mail
JB is a cross-country trucker
And he called last night from South Carolina
He said I fallen in love with a waitress
That I met at a Waffle House diner.

He said the years seem to roll on faster
Than they did back when we were kids
Then we need us a break from the grindstone
That's exactly what we did.

We put in a phone call to Sonny
Then we stayed out all night long
We drank a few cold ones, then told a few old ones
And sang another verse to the song.

Yeah we were boys who made a lot of noise

Bookin' down the line
And she was lookin' fine
Long and lean and dressed to kill
Stacked up high with perfect wheels 
And there ain't no chance, that girl would ever dance with me
She got all those city boys pushin' and shovin'
A country boy like me don't ever get no uptown lovin'

She's Sweet, she's got 'em melting in her hand

Sure is a lucky man
She's sweet, telling you boys
She's babelicious, I can't reach that Georgia peach
But she sure looks delicious

I had nothing else to do
So I threw down two more shots of booze
And it made me strong
I strapped my courage on
I said 'would you like a drink?
'By chance, no what I mean is would you like to dance with me?
Please.' in my best southern ease
It got hot on the dance floor when she whispered in my ear
'I think I found my county boy, let's get out of here.'

I said 'sweet'.

I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here

Or maybe Turkministan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban

Said they would stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr. Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran he said now
You sons a' bitches, you better not be doin' any business with the Taliban
Ooo, ooo the Taliban, baby
Now we prayed to Allah with all of our might
Until those big U.S. jets came flyin' in one night
They dropped little bombs all over the holy land

Tight on the top with a belly button ring a little tattoo

What's it gonna be?

Toby Keith,"On a rainy Wednesday morning, on the day that I was born
In my old sharecropper's one room country shack
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just like to mention that my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning and a milking and a churning
Picking cotton raisin' hell and baling hay

I been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Carolina, I don't guess
I'll ever find another woman put together like you are
With your wiggle and you're walking and your big city talking
And your brand new shiny Plymouth rag top car

Hey, let's hurry up and wait in this world of give and take
It seems like haste it makes me waste every time
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll
You better know I get my share of mine

I been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

Was a lonesome whistle blowing,
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride,
On a freight train leaving town,

From a family, meek and mild,

Towards the bad, I kept turning.

Toby Keith,"She said I've seen you in here before,
I said I've been here a time or two,
She said hello my name is Bobbi Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight,
You're the only cowboy in this place,
If your up for a rodeo,
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face.

I said girls,
I ain't as good as I once was,
I got a few years on me now,
But there was a time,
Back in my prime,
When I could really lay it down,
If you need some love tonight,
Then I might have just enough,
I ain't as good once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was.

I still hang out with my best friend Dave,
I've known him since we were kids at school.
Last night he had a few shots,
Got in a tight spot
Hustling a game of pool,
With a couple of red neck boys,
And one great big fat biker man,
I heard David yell across the room,
Hey Buddy how bout a helping hand.

I said Dave!
I ain't as good as I once was,
My how the years have flown,
But there was a time,
Back in my prime,
When I could really hold my own,
But if you want a fight tonight,
Guess those boys don't look all that tough,
I ain't as good once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was.

I used to be hell on wheels,
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says ""Oh, You can't do this boy"",
But my pride says ""Oh yes you can""

I ain't as good as I once was,
That's just the cold, hard truth,(huh)
I still throw a few back,
Talk a little smack,
When I'm feeling bullet proof,
So don't double, dog dare me now,
Cause I'd have to call your bluff,
I ain't as good as I once once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was.

May not be good as I once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was",As Good as I Once Was,2005

See that big blue note
Over there on the counter
You don't want to read that thing, man
It's a real 'get you down'er
But don't you dare say
Nothin' else bad about her
She's gone

No no no, no, no, don't throw it away
'Cause tonight I might need it
It gets real lonely around here at night sometimes
And I have to reread it
Besides, you show it to the boys downtown
They won't believe that

There used to be a time
I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find
Just like that, she's up and vanished
And the only thing she left behind for me

Is this big blue note
Folded up in my pocket
Yeah, don't laugh
It's been two months
I still got it
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone

'Tell me what do you see
When you look at these ink spots
Of reds and yellows and greens
You know, I looked at 'em all

Toby Keith,"My grandmother owned a night club
On the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Mama put me on a Greyhound
And I went to stay with her in the summertime

I'd box up those empty long-necks
And stack 'em in the back and make a ham
Then at night she'd let me sneak out
Of the kitchen and sit in with the band

Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks
And broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't last forever
Semi-pro always means semi-payed

I started climbing drilling rigs
I'm oil field trash and proud as I can be, yeah
Then I took my songs and guitar
And sang 'em to a man from Tennessee

I've played every beer joint tavern
From New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena

And the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't ever be
Half empty in my optimistic mind

And a band to turn it up and play it loud

With a corner stage and a honky tonk crowd

As the fireworks popped in the summer sky
With a spark in her eye

As his face lit up to the rockets red glare

By September she'd asked him for a wedding band
How could she know he was a ramblin' man
He walked out the door in the dead of the night
And a sleepy voice whispered as he turned out the light
She said...

Where you gonna go
What ya gonna do when you get there
Who you gonna call
When your road runs out at the sea
Boy, you're never gonna find someone who loves you like I do
If you get tired of runnin'

He'd run out of luck

'Cause there's a baby on the way and that makes three of us
And I need you here beside me, I can't go it alone

And some don't go nowhere

If you're trying to save your soul
One comes with a keeper

Some aren't meant to last forever
Some are made of stone
Some are meant to cross together
Some you go alone

Some the slightest wind can send them
Crashing to the ground

But I could not burn it down

And I can see you
Standing on the other side

And here I go

And I have crossed
Some broken bridges in my time

Toby Keith,"Jacky Don Tucker was my daddy's little brother
And at seventeen he jumped the fence
He joined a rock 'n' roll band, got a tattoo on his hand
Granny said he never had a lick of sense
Cause by the time he turned seven he was a stealin' watermelons
Playin' house with the girl next door
Drinkin' muscadine wine by the time he was nine
Sneakin' out and smokin' cigarettes under the porch

He was a melon stealin'
Cop-a-feelin'
Daredevil fool
A do-it-anywayin'
Playin' hooky from school
A water tower poet class of '73
He'd say by God you better know it if you're runnin' with me
Cause I'm skinny dippin' finger flippin' son of a gun
Play by the rules
You're gonna miss all the fun

He was always drag racin' and he kept the sheriff chasin'
But they never caught ole Jacky Don
Cause he was nobody's fool, the definition of cool
He even cut a donut on the courthouse lawn
He created quite a scandal that the locals couldn't handle
When he took up with the preacher's baby girl
They bought a new double wide and on their wedding night
Aunt Jenny went to rockin'

Underneath that cypress tree

My fingers through her hair
You could cut the passion with a knife
In that southern midnight air

As my blue jeans hit the floor

Pressed up against the door

I can't spend the night without you

And I wanted to say something

Love me if you can

But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all of debatin' turns to angry words and hate
Sometimes we should just agree to disagree
And I believe that Jesus looks down here and sees us
And if you ask him he would say

Toby Keith,"I met and old man on a gray hound, on my way down to New Orleans, 
He started talking in the back seat, he pulled out a flask and passed it to me. 
He said some day you'll be my age and start looking back at where you've been,
You'll get a little sad and just a little mad when it hits you you can't do it all again. 
So order up the good wine soak up the sun shine 
And don't forget to take time and try to love someone.

You can't go back to what you missed so make it good make it last 
'Cause it all flies by so fast and you only get 1 trip.

I wasn't stayin' long, I was a wanted man
The air was thick with danger, I watched the vixens dance
My six gun in my pocket, my pistol in my pants
I let her walk up on me, she pinned me to the door
She said she swore she knew me, we'd never met before
She pressed up hard against me, I stared into her eyes
She grabbed my face and kissed me, she had me hypnotized

I'm runnin' down the road, can't find the interstate
It's like I'm being followed and I can't get away
The snakes and alligators, they whisper in the wind
I hear her calling to me, I turn around again
Cry of a Creole woman
Woke up the devil down in me

She took me to her bedroom, smelled like a cheap hotel
Never had a Cajun queen, I'm used to Southern belles
But through the smoky billows of my tobacco leaves
I watched her in the mirror as she was lovin' me

[Chorus:]

What's this you wicked woman, some kind of voodoo game?

She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kinda crazy

She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water

They knew they couldn't stop her

Left her daddy standin' there

Said I'll be sure 'n phone ya

In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started takin' it's toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

It's hard as hell out on this highway
But I'm still addicted to the show
When that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
A gypsy driftin' down the road

Buses, trucks and lit up stages
Angel faces with no names
Stadium of savin' graces
Stand and singing with a flame

[Chorus]

I go on when I'm too tired to sleep
And I go on, sing when I can't speak
I go on and on and on and on

Yeah I'd try to keep her happy if I had one

She's runnin' my tab up callin' me baby

I'd probably shake it the same dang way

I'd never buy another beer if I had one

That's what I'd do, if I had one of those

I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yeah

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

She was sittin' on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac Deville
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free ride for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfolded on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us man
You're dumb enough to die

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
It makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah

We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're runnin' from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I couldn't spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke to the sound of sirens and
The sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my 44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
The only thing that's left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Man, bullets filled the air

You never see it comin'
'Til it hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run

There's a waitress named Lily, shows up at 7
To make sure their service is great 
And there's a black dude named Elmo that 
Cooks in the kitchen
Burgers and chicken fried steak
Yeah around 9 o'clock the band will start
Playing
And the music will fill up the air 
Then they'll take a break every 45 minutes 
And the jukebox takes over from there 

[Chorus]

It's 1:35, last call's upon us
It's time to settle the score 
Won't you call me a cab and bring me a tab
And while you're at it, bring me one more 

She's cleaned the last table and shined up the bar
It's late and everyone's gone 
Then she'll cock her pistol and count all her money
Then drive that old Chrysler back home 

[Chorus]

Yeah good night sweet Clancy 
In your neighborhood tavern
We'll see you tomorrow my girl",Clancy's Tavern,2011
Toby Keith,"She was a dancer at the Club Zydeco Moon
An all night social house and all day saloon
She had the face and body, the devil's own desire
Her lips were full and sugar sweet as blackberry wine

She danced around my table
Flashin' gris-gris eyes at me
Swayin' to the tempo of a squeezebox melody
She reached down and snatched the folded money from my fist
So easy to give into and too hard to resist

She did her business underneath the candle light
Always aware of Mama Zuzu's watchful eye
How many young boys have lost their innocence
Turned into old men wonderin' where their money went

What happened 20 years ago seem like yesterday
I don't drive through that part of town, I go the other way
She still dances through my bedroom every time I go to sleep
To the rhythm of the music that the squeezebox player keeps

I smell the incense burning Mama Zuzu's cigarette
Louisiana heat wave and the midnight sumer sweat
Somewhere down that alley there's an old run down saloon
And she's waiting there for me at Club Zydeco Moon

She danced around my table
Flashin' gris-gris eyes at me
Swayin' to the tempo of a squeezebox melody
She reached down and snatched the folded money from my fist
So easy to give into and too hard to resist

Drinking everything we could get our hands on

Hopin' we didn't get caught

Where old red stopped I just stayed

I had a place she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues (bout')

You're my friend, yea (lifelong)
Thank you for being my friend""

It’s been awhile since I’ve seen this side of you

Beautiful stranger in the candle light
God must have told you that I needed this tonight
I’ve longed for this feeling alone here in the dark
With a beautiful stranger in my arms

There a window moon and and old love tune playing soft and low
Takes me back, I’ve always loved that song
I pull you in and there’s comfort in the shape we make
Wrapped up in each other all night long

Beautiful stranger in the candle light
God must have told you that I needed this tonight
I’ve longed for this feeling alone here in the dark
A beautiful stranger in my arms

And we danced and danced like we just met
Girl we made love like we haven’t yet
Yet

And outta nowhere, she's there
Hair on fire in the middle of the night
Just like that, she's lovin' me
Just like yesterday and into the thin air
She disappears again

Took her sandals, took her sundress
Took her ten dollar sand dollar necklace
She left a barefoot beach and a sunset
And all the love we made that night
Took some blame and some time for herself
Pretty much left everything else
It ain't what she took that messes with my mind
It's what she left behind

Clothes she wore the night before
Still layin' on the bathroom floor
When I found her ring on the sink I died right there
Where she said goodbye
Have a bottle of wine, where she found the nerve
A goodbye I never heard
On a teardropped letter I didn't read
But the worst thing she left was me

Took her ten dollar sand dollar necklace

For the first time in all of her years
I said mama you gotta be kidding me
She said things ain’t like they used to be round here
You just wouldn’t believe it
Kids growing up without Jesus
Good thing your daddy ain’t here to see this now
They stay higher than the water tower
In this thirty five mile an hour town

She said it ain’t the drugs, it ain’t the booze
I’ve had a backroad buzz or two, myself
It seems like heaven is slipping further away
The devil ain’t got far to go when they raise hell
We used to burn a hole through midnight
Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light  and on a good night
Might kill a 5th of Crown but now
There’s a lower higher power
In this thirty five mile an hour town

Oh we can’t blame the babies for growing up lazy
And crazy it ain’t them that let them down
If they ain’t stealing, they’re suing
Why work when we’ll give it to ‘em
It’s right there in the bible that we don’t put out
Spare the rod and you’ll sour
A thirty five mile an hour town

The “yes mam’s gone and the “please’s too,
It’s out the door with the “thank you” in the evening
You don’t see a front yard football game
The neighbor kids have done away with the shirt and skins
No one hits the front porch lights
To get the kids to come inside
'Cause the streets ain’t safe for a bike to ride down
Since they planted a prowler

How fast they drive this thirty five mile an hour

No, I can't love you no more.

Toby Lightman,"Everyday is a struggle between what I wanna say
And what I should keep to myself
And the words that manage to leave my lips
Don't hurt me, but they hurt everyone else

And I find myself in need of a pause
I'm not sure why, but I think that it's because
Of this desire to be what others want me to be
Which is nothing close to me

But I'll see better when the smoke clears
When the smoke clears inside my head
And I can listen when the screaming doesn't repeat everything I've said
And all that remains me and who I am at the end of the day
And this happens everyday

Everyday is a battle between what I wanna know
And what I don't wanna figure out
And everything in between in these thoughts of mine
That you know I can't live with out

And I find myself in need of a pause
I'm not sure why, but I think that it's because
Of this desire to be what others want me to be
Which is nothing close to me

But I'll see better when the smoke clears

With the guy in the front row?

But you don't know where I'm from, 
Where I belong,

You don't know what he's about, and he walks to his own beat
And he, takes you on a journey that you can't really define
But you know it might be worth it, you know it's not a waste of your time

Love is like diving into an ocean that is certainly too deep
To feel, the sand in your toes, and the bottoms of your feet
But for, some strange reason you stay cold and wet
'Cause you know deep down that you haven't seen, the best of it yet
And all the while you wonder

[Chorus]
Is this right? How do we know
If we never been here before?
Is this right, how do we know
Should we take a chance tonight, take the chance tonight
Should I be sitting by your side, for the rest of your life
Is this right, how do we know?
How do we know?

Love is like jumping from the top of the highest mountain
Just to feel, the freedom of no boundaries and the wind in your hair
And you fly on and on, you fly up to the moon
'Cause this freedom will bring you ecstasy, and you know you're gonna feel it soon
And all the while you wonder

[Chorus]

All I had to do is paint a picture of you in my mind
And I held on tight
Just one look at you I know everything's gonna be all right
And so I'm ready this time.

Am I the one in control?

Ami I the one at the wheel?

Last time I checked, it was my turn

to say how I feel

Cause you're not the one going through with it

and you're not the one who gotta do it

Am I the one at the wheel?


Don't let go

It's always on the tip of my tongue

I won't take another second

Don't lay low

Boy you better keep listening cause

I'm gonna tell you when it's over

but it's not over yet


I can't sit and listen to what you have to say

I'm sick of hearing your voice

I'm sick of going your way

cause you're not the one who's gotta live with it

and you're not the one who's giving in to it

I'm sick of hearing your voice


(Don't let go..)


Don't talk to me like you can't believe

That I don't know what I want when I want it

Don't question me about what I need

I'll fill you in

When I'm ready for it

If you don't let me take my time

Nothing's gonna feel right

I won't forget to tell you when

I'm gonna tell you when it's over

but it's not over yet


Don't let go

It's always on the tip of my tongue

I won't take another second

Won't let go

You'll be the first to know when I'm done

Hate to say but I've just begun

Don't lay low

I'm gonna tell you when it's over

but it's not over yet

If I'm blind, give me eyes to see

If I'm dreaming, don't wake me

If I'm wrong, please tell me to leave

If I'm dreaming, don't wake me


There's things you want

and there's things you need

Like water to drink and air to breathe

You need love for your heart to last

Cause a life without love's

A life that should pass.


But it's gotta be right, no it can't be wrong

But how do you know when two belong

I found a man that I think is good

Is he for real or have I misunderstood?


Oh I need you to tell me true

Is he the one to pull me thought

or will he push me away?


(If I'm blind, ....)


My favor to ask is a simple task

Don't be my friend, you gotta try to act

and lure him in with an evil way

Will he hold firm or will you see him sway


Now I know you think tis is in bad taste

But I don't wanna see your love go to waste

Don't want my heart to break over some kinda creep

I've been looking for awhile,

for something to believe

Everything thought I put on trial ends up being guilty

I guess I need good luck on my side

So take those black cats away

If you're that blessing in disguise, I'll stop the search today


You're a flower blooming in the desert sunshine

You're a diamond resting in a dark coal mine

Where all the blackness now looks so damn bright

You're that once in the lifetime good find


When the words don't find me, you're the

thought that clears my head

Then that song always reminds me of all those

beautiful things you said

These nights are never ending, and all the days

feel the same

That's when my honesty starts bending and

you say, is the truth to blame


",Good Find,2006

You're making this way to hard and pushing

me way too far past my limit

You know this is new to me but I never

thought I would be the only one to give it


Come on baby take what I'm giving, stop

messing around

Quit bringing me down

You better take it while you can get it

Cause I won't hang around if you're

holding me down


Something's not feeling right here, are we

clear, you better shape up

This ain't about what you need so all this greed

better be made up


Come on baby take what I'm giving, stop

messing around

Quit bringing me down


You better take it while you can get it

Cause I won't hang around if you're

holding me down

Don't want to be the one to regret it

When you hit the ground, I'm not holding you down

If you don't take it now then forget it

Stop messing around, quit bringing me down


I'm someone worth loving so why you shoving

me out of the picture

So take this off my back and stop this damn

attack and get it together

know what I need

Low tide, I don't need anything

Cause at some point I know I'll fall apart

And find myself unraveling, into my one sure thing

Those nights I can't sleep without a drink

There's nights, I see everything

Other nights, all I want is my one sure thing


Oh these nights I don't feel anything

But most of the time, I can't feel anything

Maybe then I'll be able to feel

I can do it, I know I will

Always taking a carpet ride

Always wanted to look not hide

Cause I never want to be found

until I take a look around


They think I'm a waste of time

They think I'm lost and that's fine

They call me crazy while they're holding me down

But I'm overflowing and I'm gonna get it out


Maybe I can walk on the sun

Maybe I'll be the only one

Man I just want to have some fun

Cause baby I'm born to roam


They can try to turn off the light

But they better expect a fight

They can try with all their might

But I'm never gonna go home,

So please leave me alone

And only I know why

Gotta make a plan gotta take a stand,

tell them who I am

Toby Love,"(Toby love) oh 
Tuve entre mis manos el cielo 
Y lo deje escapar 
Tan solo era decir que te quiero 
Pero no puede hablar 
Lo siento 

Diste tanto amor en tus besos 
Y en cada despertar. 
Puede que te cueste creerlo no supe como amar 
Y la verdad al respirar me huele a soledad 

Y miro atras y tu te vas y empiezas a olvidar 
Y si es tarde para hablar 
Para volver atras 
Volver a comenzar de nuevo 

Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da dime como volar 
Si eres mis alas, mi viento 
Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da si eres tu que me dio 
Toda su alma en un beso 

Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da si eres tu que me dio 
Las estrellas el cielo 
Dime que voy a hacer sino puedo olvidar 
Un amor como el que tu supiste dar 

Lo que duele mas al mirarte 
Mas que te vas a ir 
Es que se me hizo tan tarde 
Poder decir te quiero 
Y la verdad al respirar 
Me huele a soledad 
Y miro atras 
Y tu te vas y empiezas a olvidar 
Y si es tarde para hablar 
Para volver atras volver a comenzar de nuevo 

Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da dime como volar 
Si eres mis alas, mi viento 

Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da si eres tu que me dio 
Toda su alma en un beso 

Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da si eres tu quien colgo
Las estrellas el cielo 
Dime que voy a hacer sino puedo olvidar 
Un amor como el que tu supiste dar 

Que si es tarde para hablar 
Para volver atras volver a comenzar de nuevo 

Amores como el tuyo

Amores como el tuyo 
Quien lo da si eres tu que me dio

And all the mornings that I miss so much
Como olvidar nuestros momentos de la intimidad

Porque dejaste de soñar

Cambiaste de la noche a la mañana
Dejandome sin fe (oooooh by)
Ahora heart to beat as one
Pack your bags 'cause now we're done (ohh girl)

Estoy sufriendo soy tu desamor
Pero no pienso seguir asi
Estoy dispuesto a ser
De nuevo el hombre aquel que fui

Ahh
All my life I've had someone to share my deepest thoughts and blessings.

For that I thank you.

You said I'll be a star some day, because of you these songs I sing today.

Ohh

Now tell me oh Momma,
What 'ya think about your boy today?

Everything I am is 'cause of you, you cleared my cloudest skies and now they're blue.

why siempre sere el nino aquel,
The one that always made you smile, always be there for 'ya (always be there for 'ya)

why siempre seras la madre ideal me llenas de alegria always be there for 'ya (always be there for 'ya.)

And even thought times were rough when I was younger, you were there to stop my hunger.
You took it all away, away.

Through the heartaches and the pain you always stayed the same.

My run is with the law, against the world we fought, I need you to forgive me (forgive me).

Now tell me oh Momma,
What 'ya think about your boy today?

Everything I am is 'cause of you, you cleared my cloudest skies and now they're blue.

why siempre sere el nino aquel,
The one that always made you smile, always be there for 'ya (always be there for 'ya)

why siempre seras la madre ideal me llenas de alegria always be there for 'ya (always be there for 'ya.)

Always.

Te llevo, muy dentro.
And I will never forget about you (will never forget about you).
Remember repay you

Give me a minute
Listen to what I have to say

Never thought we'd say goodbye

Cuando te siento lejos de mi
Vivir sin ti, me mata el dolor
Es que yo no soy nada sin ti

Siento en mi piel tus manos acariciándome
Te busco y no te encuentro amor
Es que yo vivo extrañándote

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Eres mi cielo, eres mi luz eres mi despertar
A ti te entrego todo sin mirar atrás
'Cause it's all about you and your future with me
Girl, it's so simple to see that this was destined to be

Abrázame, sentir que el tiempo es corto y se va
No existe la distancia en mi amor
Sera tuyo por la eternidad

Amándote, besándote y tu besándome
Descubro que estoy sintiendo que quiero morir
y amarte otra vez; sabes que

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Ouu tengo un amor que habita en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ah ah ah de mi pasión
y me lleva Volando hasta ti

Como le digo al corazon
Que ya no esta mas contigo
Sintiendo caricias tuyas si en verdad
No estas conmigo Cierro los ojos y te veo

Me refugio en tu recuerdo
y a la vez que pasa el tiempo
Me da miedo perderlo

Mi corazon se lamenta desde el día que tu te fuiste
Disimula estar sano cuando en verdad esta muy triste
Quiero saber si de verdad yo volverá a amarte
Quiero saber si siempre vivirá pa' recordarte

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon

Lo que yo estoy sintiendo desde que te vi llegar un día a mi vida
No se como disimular
Que tengo un alboroto que me pica poco a poco todo el día

Quizás tan solo es de decirlo
O el llamar a algún amigo
Y confesarle mi secreto
Quizás sea mejor guardarlo
Alimentarlo y no entregarlo
Hasta que no pueda aguantarlo ni un segundo no mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Y si te digo la verdad
Voy a escribir todos mis versos
Que te tengo por decir para entregarte vida mía
Que ya no me quiero aguantar
Te vas a tener que enterar
Que mis latidos tienen dueño para siempre en tu guarida*

Cayo la luz que alumbra el día
Y empieza mi delirio por querer que ya amanezca para verte
La noche es larga sin tenerte
Y paso en mi desvelo suspirando una caricia pa' quererte

Quizás no tengo que esperar
Te lo repito sin cesar
Entenderás lo que yo siento
No tengo más con que abreviar
Mi corazón se va a estallar
Por retenerte todo el tiempo aquí en mi mente si mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Guárdame siempre donde no haya frío
Arropa este amor que te tengo

A darte mi sueños
Y mi vida todo lo que soy

Traia mil versos en un papel
Tantas carisias que para ti guarde
Y el amor que hay en mi
Desde que te bese

Y hoy me das tu adios
Sin explicacion sin motivo y sin razon
Y me dices no sin pedir perdon
Y me dejas sin tu amor

Happy Valentine,
My love,
Hoy me haz roto el corazon

Happy Valentine,
My l,
Y me quedo solo
Y triste sin tu amor

Estoy bien herido
Al saber que no estas
Tu embrujo prohibido de un amor
Que no fue realidad

La melodia que no escuche
La fantasia que solo me invente
La ilusion y el amor que un dia imagine

Y ahora tu te vas
Sin mirar atras en silencio sin hablar
Y no se olvidar y no se escapar
De esta fria soledad

Happy Valentine,
My love,
Hoy me haz roto el corazon

Happy Valentine,
My love,
Y me quedo solo y triste sin tu amor

Dime que regresaras
Dime que hay otra oportunidad.

Para entregarte cada beso
Que por siempre esperara por ti

Y hoy me das tu adios
Sin explicacion sin motivo y sin razon
Y me dices no sin pedir perdon
Y me dejas sin tu amor

Se hace fuerte un secreto
Necesita llorar

De vez en cuando
Necesita que siga lloviendo
Un aguacero de mayo más
Que pueda cubrir mis lágrimas
Yo
Necesito llorar por amor
Necesito pintar mi dolor

Si salgo a la calle
Con lluvia que cae
Tengo partido el corazón
Y la lluvia no cae

Quisiera llorar lloviendo
Para cubrir mi cara y mis lagrimas con el agua
Quisiera llorar lloviendo
Los hombres también lloran, déjame llorar
Quisiera llorar lloviendo
Para cubrir mi cara y mis lágrimas con el agua
Quisiera llorar lloviendo
Para cubrir mi cara y que no me vean llorar

Recuerdo fatal,
Un enero vacio principio del año sin tu querer

Paso las horas llega el atardecer
Más temprano que nunca deprisa
Como niebla en las nubes te avisan

Y ahora, (y ahora)
Tú eres quien llora, la que llora mi amor
Cual domingo al 1 de mayo
Sin poder evitar el fracaso.

Y ahora, (y ahora)
No sé qué hacer,
Separar de nuevo en mis brazos
O dejarte volver tras tus pasos

La voz de la juventud
El escogido
Tú me sientes

Tenías 15 años,
Yo te enseñe a querer
Y en tu ramo de flores decía ""happy birthday""
Todo era feliz, Feliz, amor
Cada día más, como sucedió
No sé yo deje de vivir por ti
Y sin mirar atrás me fui

Y ahora, (y ahora)
Tú eres quien llora, la que llora mi amor
Cual domingo al 1 de mayo
Sin poder evitar el fracaso.

Y ahora, (y ahora)
No sé qué hacer, (whoa!)
Separarte de nuevo en mis brazos
O dejarte volver tras tus pasos

Hoy, hoy
Déjame vivir
Hoy, hoy
Aléjate de mí
Yo soy,
El mismo de ayer

Y devuélveme las llaves con todo y tarjetas

De más está decir que esto no sirvió
Que ya se perdió, sí, mucho rindió
Wow, aguanté mucha pichaera, mucho nebuleo
Ahora soy yo el que decide hablarte sin rodeo
Mírame a la cara y atrévete a decirme que fuiste fiel
Mira, lo que es amargo nunca sabe a miel
Después que te enfangaste quién sabe con quién
No reclames si usted no lo hizo bien

Soy igual que tú

Pero ni siquiera te atrevas a reclamar
Lo que tú estás pasando ya yo lo pasé
Lo superé, perdoné, pero no olvidé
Hoy a nuestro amor lo entierro
Así que brega con tu caso
Es triste, pero, la diferencia es
Que yo no me aferro

I pray that you are mine

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me away from you

Te quiero y solo vivo por ti

Do what you wanna do 
So when you gonna choose 
When you gonna try to find your peace of mind 
It's right there in front of you 
It's time to make a move 
You can still deny but the time's running out 
Very very soon

Everybody everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High smiling on me, soâ?¦
Let's get this party started

Blind-sided by the blitz
Come on baby it's on
I couldn't wait to get on this
You ain't no quiet storm

I'm gonna tell it like it is
There ain't no stopping us now
Somebody shut me up so I can live out loud
Them people thought I was gone

It's been a long time comin'
But straight out the box
We got the dark side runnin'
So Father, Most High won't You show Yourself
And shine on this record like nobody else",What's Goin' Down,2001
tobyMac,"Every time I turn my back I get the feeling that
I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat
I'm out of control, need you to fill my soul up
And could you shed a little light on the skeletons holed up
My past is taking me to task
And I can't guarantee how much longer I'll last
Without You I'm a hopeless wreck
So I cry out Your name as I drop to the deck
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So take this space between us and fill it up again
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So won't you take this space between us and fill it up again
Simple minded little punk
Thought I was the junk
Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk
What was I out of my mind
Or was I just trippin' on an ego
But You filled up the space and You never let me go
Bullseye to the center of my soul
One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow
This love was Your gun, mercy Your shells
Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So you can take your best shot
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops

tobyMac,"Watch baby, watch baby
I got it like that
Watch baby, watch baby
So I got it like that, I got it like that

Suggestions, questions people want to know
Is there life after talk 'cause there's talk on the road
Twistin' words that I've never even said
To the ones that I trust or my boo in our bed

Will he make it
Man I bet he won't
As they're runnin' through the minutes
On their cell phones so the pictures painted
You got the point and that junk's creepin' into my solo joint

Sometimes I feel God in the middle of the night
In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back
See I'm down with the King
So I got it like that

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back
See I'm down with the King
So I got it like that, I got it like that

It's no joke, I've been roped in chokin' on a bone
From a fish in the school of your twilight zone
You shook me, took me to me to another place
Where the air I'm breathing is like mace in my face

If this controversy is your way
You need to know I'll never doubt my destiny
'Cause I'm stickin' to my guns like a Son of the Light
Feelin' Dad, I'm feelin' Daddy in the air tonight

Sometimes I feel Grace in the middle of the night
In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight
Sometimes I feel God in the midst of a show
As the palm trees sway in an afterglow

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back
See I'm down with the King
So I got it like that

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back
See I'm down with the King

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay

Feel me like a fingertip
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heart felt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

On an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and stayin' candid, reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to

A mountainous fontaine, spinnin' and monsoonin'
Grinnin' it's high octane, explosive how I came
Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hastle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle

Stay afloat catch a second wind, thin is the air I breathe
Teary eyed nose runnin', wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm callin' on the savior, to be all that I need
Please forgive me, my behavior had me lost at light speed

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me please come my way

Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay

Feel me like a fingertip
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heart felt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

The fear of never falling in love
And the tears after losing the feelings of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug
My life be like bad characteristics to cover in Christ's blood

The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze trying to ease my woes

In this world of sin, clothes to thin to fend
So to God I send words of help to win
In grumblings so deep, letters could never express
So the sound of, oh ah, beneath my breath projects

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me please come my way
Like leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay

Come young diti, here comes that boy from the capital city
Last up on the Grits new diti
But eight bars of the truth will do, eh

I believe there's a bride that's stunning
And, I believe in the kingdom coming
I believe if you seek the truth
You don't need to look far 'cause it's gonna find you

I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.

But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and

I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?

When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there.
People say I'm crazy.
Just a little touched.
But maybe showers remind me of
""Psycho"" too much.

Who's watching?
Well, it's the mailman watching me:  and I don't feel safe anymore.

Nobody told me bout the emptiness,
When the place you call home is closed for business

Holdin on my pillow tight
He spoke to me and said that everything was gonna be alright
So I try to fight all the pain that it caused
I try to move on and I try to stay strong

And put your hands up for everyone to see
So put your hands up, we all a family
So put your hands up in unity, its unity

Got me believin' I can ""save the day""
I'm up and running like their ain't no tomorrow
I'd rather burn for you than fade away
I'd rather burn for you than go my way 

I'm a whole new guy with a whole new vibe
Changed inside, more flame in the fire
Can't stop, won't stop praying for desire
Like the bunny on the screen feel so energized
Old shell gone without a trace, new face
No more shortness of breath, new pace
Live life now without the taste of fear

I know it's over 'cause my feet have hit the cold floor
Check my reflection; I ain't feelin' what I see

Whatever happened to a passion I could live for?
What became of the flame that made me feel more?
And when did I forget that...

A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn

Causing us to pause

No Vietnam

I'm Your prisoner by choice
I will rest at Your feet
And I'll only lift my voice

And it's the mystery of You that tears me apart

If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if I should get a peaceful sleep
I wanna wake at my Father's feet

You got me captured

The dew's on the ground

The blue mountain bean is clearin' my stare
I make recompense
It's all makin' sense
Like blood in my veins
You're my sustenance
A moment of trust
The ""me"" becomes ""us""
The ""we"" become ""one""

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
They see a bright new shining star,
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
""let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"".

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Eye on it, eye on it

I set my eyes to the west, walking away from it all
Reaching for what lies ahead, I got my eye on it
I see my sweat hit the ground
I put my foot in the block
This is the race of my life
And I can’t wait for this shot

‘Cause I can feel the wind at my back
Chest is pumping like a heart attack
Feet are moving and my mind is locked
Pressing on with everything I got

I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
Eye on it

I’ve got my eye on the prize, I’ve got my eye on it
I’ve got my eye on the prize, I’ve got my eye on it
I’ve got my eye on the prize, I’ve got my eye on it
I’ve got my eye on the prize and I will not quit

I’ve got a new passenger to help me navigate the way
So when my heart hits the floor I can re-calibrate
I feel the deeper call in me, all else is fading in the past
So let me run in the race that I know is built last

‘Cause I can feel the wind at my back
Chest is pumping like a heart attack
Feet are moving and my mind is locked
Pressing on, I gotta take my shot

I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
Eye on it

I’ve got my eye on the prize, I’ve got my eye on it
I’ve got my eye on the prize, I’ve got my eye on it
I’ve got my eye on the prize, I’ve got my eye on it
I’ve got my eye on the prize and I will not quit

I will not quit

Broken pieces lying around where it went down
Water rising back to silence, quietly crying
Wondering how and look at us now
We thought our love would take the world by storm

Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
You’re gonna take a piece of my heart
If you leave

So it’s two separate ways
Or am I too late to say?
I wanna fight for what we got
'Cause I believe in family
In family

So are we still trying?
Or simply surviving?
We’re facing these giants
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

But I still believe in
They dreams we’ve been dreaming
The hope that we build on
It’s never too far, it’s never too far

My whole life I’ve wondered how
Just wonderin’ how I could turn around
It’s over now, yea

I’mma leave myself fresh melodies
Wanna be in Your beautiful symphony
It’s over now

You sing to me and my heart comes to life
Beating for you every time (it’s beating beating)
And how ‘bout I hear you oh I love the way
Your chorus gets stuck in my mind

Like the lyrics to my favourite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I’ve reached the end
I wanna hear it again

Like the lyrics to my favourite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I’ve reached the end
I wanna hear it again

Well he already makes it so surprising
Like raindrops when the sun is shining
It’s beautiful to me

So you flip my words and change the tempo
And somehow you just make it simple
So beautiful to see

You sing to me and my heart comes to life
Beating for you every time (it’s beating beating)
And how ‘bout I hear you oh I love the way

And we all step across the line
But nothing’s sweeter than the day we find
We find

It’s hanging over him like the crowds of Seattle
And raining on his swag, falling deeper in the saddle
It’s written on his face, he don’t have to make a sound
Somebody call the 5-0, we’ve got a man down

Now you can go and play it like your own rock ‘n’ roll
It does the job on each and every man’s soul
And when your head is a pillow with a nice fall
You can beat your life that it’s gonna be a fight y’all

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we’ve all stepped across that line
But nothing’s sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness

And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing’s sweeter than the pain
Sweeter than the pain, recall

Time for forgiveness
We all need, we all need
We all need forgiveness
We all need, we all need

This the Lecrae

My mama told me what I would be in for
If I get to the sun, get inside of me pimped up
My heart’s been broken and my wounds been open
And I don’t know if I can hear I’m sorry been spoken
But those forgiving much should be quicker to give it
And God forgave me for it all, Jesus beg forgiveness
So when the stones fly and they aimed at you
Just say forgive them Father, they know not what they do

Now you can go and play it like your own rock ‘n’ roll
It does the job on each and every man’s soul
And when your head is a pillow with a nice fall
You can beat your life that it’s gonna be a fight y’all

Time for forgiveness
You know we need that that that
You know we need that that that
You know we need that that that

No matter how lost you are
You’re not that far, you’re not too far (from forgiveness)
No matter how hurt you are
You’re not that far, you’re not too far (from forgiveness)
And no matter how wrong you are
You’re not that far, you’re not too far (from forgiveness)
No matter who you are
You’re not that far, you’re not too far (from forgiveness)

You speak love, you speak

You speak life, oh oh oh oh oh

Lift your head a little higher
Spread the love like fire
Hope will fall like rain
When you speak life with the words you say
Raise your thoughts a little higher
Use your words to inspire
Joy will fall like rain when you speak life with the things you say

Lift your head a little higher
Spread the love like fire

Another late flight
It’s almost show time and Diverse city’s waiting on me

They want the beat to drop but what we really need is you

I’ll give you set a stage

Two turned tables uh and a microphone
I was flipping over 33’s
Working on rhymes and melodies
Searching for some more review (can’t hear the less of me)

It’s never been my dream
To see my face in magazines
It’s always been about the music
Hoping God would use it to set some people free

But I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Lord you open every door I’ve stepped through yea?
And I try to keep my head about it
I’m thankful for the friends around me
I’m thankful for You yea yea yea

I’ve been on this road
But you come to my shows
Sometimes just to feel what y’all
(But at times we’re closed)

But you’ve been right there to rock with us
We come together, we lift him up
Seeing You there inspires me, put Your fire in me

The Carol Of These Kings vibrates the soul
Reminding us that a true King is born)

Midnight strikes and aw
See them rushing through the stained doors
Like kids in a sugarcane store
Is this what they stood in rain for?
Suddenly, Isle 3
Stood a sight so angelically
Inhale voice to the sky
Hear the bells ring it goes:

Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

No panic, no stress
Opposite security threat
‘Cause their eyes declared peace be still
In the midst of hopelessness
On their knees all agree
To reconcile to the King of peace
Many voices, one plea
And you can hear them scream it goes:

Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

So we’re laying down our crowns when the carol bell sounds

Now behold the rich and poor
Neighboring and distant shore
A baby King existing more than
A manger in the Inn
The source of life for man
Whose glory lights the land
The remedy for sin in generation and again and again
We’re thankful for gifts and the presents but
Give us the gift of your presence Sir (please)?
‘Cause we all long to be
A symphony of royalty so with this we sing

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we’ve traveled so far
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star
