CeCe Winans,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all you Christmases be bright",White Christmas,1995
CeCe Winans,"Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak, I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say, count on

I can see that it's hurting you, I can feel your pain
It's hard to see the sunshine, through the rain, oh
I know sometimes it seems as if, it's never gonna end
But you'll get through it
Just don't give in cause you can

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak, I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say, count on

You can count on me

I know sometimes it seems as if, we're standing all alone
Be we'll get through it, 'cause love won't let us fall

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak, I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say, count on

There's a place inside of all of us
Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
The answers there within, oh
I know that life can make you feel
It's much harder than it really is
But we'll get through it, just don't give in

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak, I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say, count on",Count on Me,1995
CeCe Winans,"Whenever I call you're always there
Whenever I'm hurting you ease the pain

Never disappointed, never ever let down
Never too busy whenever I'm hurting
To take the time out to stop the pain
Never too hurried
Whenever I'm worried
that's the reason I'll make it known

(chorus)
Everytime I run to you
Everytime I come to you
Everytime I call you
You're right there
Everytime I reach for you
Anytime I ever needed you
Everytime I call you
You're right there

It's not uncommon at the beginning
For love to be at your beck and call
It's been some time now
and you haven't slowed down
That's the reason I'll make it known

(chorus)
It's not on purpose the wrong I've done
It's just that my weaknesses caused me to run
But the fear of failure loses it's scare
In the calm of knowing you're always there

(chorus)",Every Time,1996
CeCe Winans,"I'm safe and sound
Serene and calm
Whenever I'm here, I know you're with me
My secret place
Where I escape
From all the cares of this race
Because of your grace

Joy fills my heart
Peace rules and reigns there
Nothing but love overflows
And your will clearly shown
(When I'm) Alone in the presence of you

Wisdom is served
And life preserved
From all your words that you speak Lord
Power displayed
And weakness fades
All of the pain erased

Nothing but love overflows
And your will clearly shown

CeCe Winans,"Since the beginning you knew
He's been with you
You were raised in the church
So you know I'm tellin' the truth
Livin' like you don't know right from wrong
Tellin yourself you're okay
God's word is always right
Just admit you've left the way
So I'm here to tell ya
It doesn't matter what you've done or where you been
Just fall on your knees, confess and he will forgive your sins

(chorus)
Come on back home, you've been away too long
God has been good to you
He's brought you through and through
Why can't you see the signs
We're living at the end
Jesus is coming soon
Don't wait too late my friend

Just surrender and stop the fight
Go head and throw in the towel
Why run from love any longer
When you're almost out of time
Let him restore you
And break up that fallow ground
All power is in his hands
To turn your whole life around
Let him in your heart
The choice is yours you don't have to be ashamed

Come on back home, you've been away too long
God has been good to you
He's brought you through and through
Why can't you see the signs
We're living at the end
Jesus is coming soon
Don't wait too late my friend

Please don't ignore the knocking at your door
Let him in your heart, he'll forget the past and give a fresh new start
And this time hold on, don't let him, don't let him, don't let him go
He wants to wash you and fill you and heal you and love you like...

CeCe Winans,"Where there is grief, there will be hope
And if ever a hand is in need,
Know that I'll be holdin' on
Know that the peace that comes from above
Is the same everlasting love

Remember me whenever you're all alone
And if it helps you to sleep know that I'll be looking on
Know that the peace that you dream of
Is the same everlasting love

You know I've watched you 
Carry all this weight upon your shoulders
As if no one understands what you go through

But with all the might in you
Believe what I say is true
When I say that I will never ever leave you,
Or forsake you

So you just reach out as far as you can
Should the whole world just stare in disbelief
Know that I'll take hold of your hand
What your heart feels, is what you sing of
Is the same everlasting love

Everlasting love, Everlasting love
(Hm, listen)
When the darkness filled the urgent sky
And the tears welled up in the corners of my eyes
And the sun would shine for the pourin' rain
Wondered if I'd ever see daylight again

When the stars protest at the moon's refrain
And I told myself I'd surely go insane
And the earth kept turnin' at an alarmin' pace
And I couldn't talk my heart out of joinin' the race

I remember a time I couldn't close my eyes
I would lie awake dispairin'
Don't know how many nights
Afraid of death that my chest would give way to the fear
Pulled the covers over my head and I cupped my ears

In attempt to escape the deafening sounds of silence
In attempt to escape these constant visions of violence
And with death as close as it could possibly get
Heard a voice in the distance sayin' CeCe not yet

Then suddenly the darkness gave away to the light
And I threw off the covers as I closed my eyes
Just in time to feel your spirit grab my body like a glove
And I knew in that moment that it was your

That it was your everlasting, lasting love
I said it was your everlasting love, yesterday and today
Forever more it will remain, even now it's still the same
'Cause my love will never change, know that the peace
That comes from above is that same everlasting love",Everlasting Love,1998
CeCe Winans,"I am the one yes I created the whole universe
Greater than anything in heaven and in all the earth
It's my air you breathe so I'm the one that you should please
I am the one you need why should you be alone?

I am that I am
I'm all that you need
I can yes I can
no it ain't too hard for me
Do you know, really know, do you really believe
Every day, every night of your life
I am

It hurts my heart indeed to see those whom I love in need
Knowing all I wonder why they never call on me
If you just ask and I can satisfy you with the things
I'll give you everything, yes you can have it all
I tell the sun to shine, the wind to blow, the rain to fall
I move the mountains and the oceans rivers great and small
Yes everything I made I want to hear them give me praise
Especially you my children each and every day

I am that I am
I'm all that you need
I can yes I can

CeCe Winans,"When I promised you
You could trust me
I meant every word that I said
You know I understand
What you're going through
You don't have to face the night all by yourself

(chorus)
Just come, come to me
It hurts me when you cry
I won't leave you alone
When you need a hand to hold
I will be there
I'll always care

Sometimes the world can be
Such a lonely place
And you don't feel you're where you belong
It's in those times I wish
You would talk to me
'cause if you're weak
My love will make you strong

What matters now
Is the love that we share
Let's pick up the pieces and go on, go on from here
Grab hold to me
And I'll set you free...

CeCe Winans,"Sometimes I feel I can't make it
In this world on my own
So hard to see my direction
But you gave me something to help me be strong

yes you did, yes you did, yes you did
You are my peace of mind oh ou oh
You are my life
yes you are, yes you are yes you are
and now for you Lord I lift my life oh Lord

At last my horizons are sunny
My pain has been erased
A new outlook a brighter day
Since you smiled down on my spirit
All my burdens washed away yeah
I'm born again
Blessed and safe

and every song of praise I sing to you
Somethin stirs inside of me,
It's the love you have for me
That is why I dedicate my life
to you....

CeCe Winans,"When you can't find your way through the night
When you've lost touch and nothing's feeling right
You can't find that path that leads you home
You don't know which road, which road to choose
That's when you've got to

Listen with your heart, listen to your soul
Inside you'll find the answer
To take you to the place you need to go
Listen with your heart, listen and your heart will let you know
No matter where you are, the truth is never far
Just listen and your heart will lead you home

And when this world has got your mind confused
Feels like your faith has just run out on you
You can find that faith inside your soul
The strength you need lies deep, lies deep in you
That's why you've got to

Listen with your heart, listen to your soul
Inside you'll find the answer
To take you to the place you need to go
Listen with your heart, listen and your heart will let you know
No matter where you are, the truth is never far
Just listen and your heart will lead you home

We all lose our way sometimes
We all lose our faith sometimes
But if you just believe and just be strong
Trust your heart
Your heart won't do you wrong
Your heart won't do you wrong

Listen with your heart, listen to your soul
Inside you'll find the answer
To take you to the place you need to go
Listen with your heart, listen and your heart will let you know
No matter where you are, the truth is never far
Just listen and your heart will lead you home

CeCe Winans,"The world is movin much too fast
Mother's have kids, they outlast
Young men think it's hard to pass this way

Everybody's tryin hard
To find a world in a life that's flawed
When each one should be thanking God
All the way

(chorus)
I want to see you on that day
On that day
On that day
You know I want to see you on that day
On that day
On that day

We're chasing worldly vanity
Some of us living in insanity
Forgetting our humanity with no way

Break the bonds that tie your flesh
Without Him then life is death
Only He will not transgress
There's no way
Open up your heart and know
Our debts were paid for long ago
And love is all we really owe
(for a way)

Chorus",On That Day,1998
CeCe Winans,"There you go again
slippin
Doin the things you said you'd never do again
You hear me callin your name,
you're hiding
But I know just where you are
So close but yet so far
Turn around and see the miles you've come
Do you really want to go back
Just to start again
Oh my friend
I can't bear to see you go out that way
Don't make the mistake of letting go
Hold on to me your slippin

Pretending everything is okay
In the front of the crowd-your smilin
But after everyone's gone, you're all along
You're not fine-you're slippin
Take off the mask with me
I see your heart, it's hurting
If you want to stay with me, I need honesty
Don't play with me, You're slippin

Can't make it on your own, stop tryin
I've got the power to keep you from fallin
If I could just have the chance to show you
What real happiness is like
Together we'll win the fight",Slippin',1998

CeCe Winans,"On that magic night in Bethlehem, on the birthday of our Lord
The angels sang and the heavens rang with tidings of great joy
And on that night, an angel's choir had journeyed from afar

So perfect 

I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength 
But sometimes I wonder what he can do for me 
No great success to show 
No glory of my own

Is there a master plan

Of every day and have the faith

CeCe Winans,"The room grew still
As she made her way to Jesus
She stumbled through the tears
That make her blind
She felt such pain
Some spoke in anger
Heard folks whisper
There's no place here for her kind

Still on she came
Through the shame that flushed her face
Until at last she knelt before his feet
And though she spoke no words
Everything she said was heard
As she poured her love for the master
From her box of Alabaster

And I've come to pour
My praise on Him like oil
From Mary's Alabaster Box
Don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears
And I dry them with my hair
You weren't there the night He found me
You did not feel what I felt
When He wrapped His loving arms around me
And you don't know the cost
Of the oil in my Alabaster box

I can't forget the way life used to be
I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound
And I spent my days
Poured my life without measure
Into a little treasure box
I thought I found
Until the day when Jesus came to me
And healed my soul with the wonder of His touch

You did not feel what I felt
When He wrapped His loving arms around me

We've traded righteousness for pleasures of sin
And now that things have gotten way out of hand

Takin' the love that the family once owned
Mothers against the daughters, dads against sons
The way that it looks, seems like evil has won

Where there's no hope, life is not worth the while
Why would you choose to live without me
What else do you want when I am all that you need?

To find a peace of mind and someone to care

CeCe Winans,"I remember Saturdays helping Mama in her kitchen 
Conversations prying, baking with passing down the wisdom 
She said baby girl you're a queen and this is how you should be treated 
Words she washed with tears and planted in my soul 

[Chorus]
Can we just go back to the simple kinda living? 
Can we just go back and maybe start from the beginning? 
Back to better days, when love was for the giving 
Can we just go back to the way we were? 

Mama said there was a time when brothers were each others keepers 
Sisters held each other close till there was nothing left between them 
Back when a song was a song you could sing along didn't matter how long 
Just as long as it spoke to ya, sung to ya 
Do you know what I mean? 

Now I'm chasing rainbows and dreams,

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know;

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1956

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face

Cecil Taylor,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart

Cecil Taylor,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1958

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
It was grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

And we've only just begun

You say we've overcome, nothing is wrong
You say our job is done, the battle is won
But we've only just begun

You say our job is done, the battle is won
But we've only just begun",Waltz for Koop,

Valdrs, y todo se me escapa
Veras, las luz se prendera

Y el olvido viene siempre prnto lo sabes ya

Te vas, lo que te perderas
Te vas, lo se me extraaras
Despus, florecitas mandaras para ver
Si en tu cuento yo me encuentro otra vez

Saldras, tu vida dejaras
Atrs, de aquella puerta
Sabrs, que no me encontraras
Y mas, date la vuelta y ya
Y el olvido, viene siempre prnto lo sabes ya

Cecilia Vennersten,"Det vackraste jag vet
Är att se dej när do sover
Här råder stilla frid
Och jag glömmer både rum och tid
Do ligger här bredvid
Och jag känner hur do andas
Att älskas utav dej
Är det vackraste för mej

Att se morgon-dimman lätta
När mörkret sakta flyr
Och att se hur dagen åter gryr
En kylig morgonbris
Sakta sveper genom rummet
Jag kryper tätt intill
Lycklig för att do finns till

Ett ögonblick av ro ibland

Att få älska och att att älskas

Det vackraste som finns
Är att vara någon nära

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away

To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay

And all the questions that I asked myself about you
Give me answers that don't make me want to doubt you
Won't you come and be with me
And then I think you'll know
That if you come and stay you're going to see
That I care about you

Won't you be a high for me
Take my hand and fly with me
Don't want you to cry for me at all
Would you sing your song to me

I'll think of all the things that we can do
And down by the seaside, we’ve nothing to hide
For there we’ll both be secretly alone

Looking for good weather
And we can make it last a long, long time
Knowing that you’re always by my side

Can I take you home with me?
I just can’t imagine going home alone
And I hope you don’t think, you’re just another
Believe me when I say you’ll come to stay

And we can make it last a long, long time

Give you all the love I have inside

Let the angels fly let the devils die
Got to do what you can with the time at hand
Ali boom mah yeah Ali boom mah yeah
Don't worry your mind its just the test of time
In five years these be the good old days

No one knows what the future holds for everything has a season
Its not a time for war its a time for peace
Tomorrow knows tomorrow woes
I remember when grandpa use to say grandson these be the good old days

These be the good old days

Now comes the moon with its starry lights
And so begins the night life
The tribal dance puts me in a trance
As she pulls me in with her magic swing
I asked of her what do we celebrate
She said to me these be the good old days

These be the good old days

There is no future there is only now
Let's cherish these moments that we now know

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

When you smile I'll smile along
When you cry my comfort comes
When you walk I'll be beside you
Holding your hands
When the sun come out we play
I'll never be far away
When you tell me that you love me
This is what I'm gonna say

Like the fish loves the sea
Like the honey and the bee
Like a lizard loves to climb
Up into a tree
Like a bird loves to fly
Way up in the sky
Like a worm loves to go
Way down low

Like the grass loves to be green
And the earth loves to be clean
Like the sun loves to shine
And the monkey loves to climb
Hey it happens naturally
And that's the way it's got to be
And the worm still loves to go
Way down low

From the first time that I saw you
I knew that it was true
There'll be a lifelong time to spend
Around the corner around the bends
Up the hills and through the valleys
No matter how things change
This one thing will remain
I'll sing it again and again

I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

When the sun come out we play
I'll never be far away

Cedric,"They have always told me since I was a lad
That I'm the worst Sorcerer the kingdom's ever had
Whenever things go wrong, King Roland simply 
Stands and claims, ""It must be Cedric that's to blame""

No-one thinks it turns out very well
But that won't last for long

It's time for me to make my claim
Soon everyone will know my name!

All I need to do is swipe that amulet
Then I will show them who I am, you bet

Once I have the jewel, I can use its power to 
Take the king's crown, it'll be my finest hour!

They can tell me I'm no good
And call me second rate, but soon they'll see
I'm meant to be, King Cedric the Great!

When I'm the king, everyone will bow
And only do the things King Cedric will allow

Every spell I cast will always go as planned
And those who used to tease me will be at my command!

(what side) westside, fool try to take mine
Ya start to wonder, I know your name is Stevie
Don't think about it fool, 'cause you know you can't see me

I'm the Snoop Doggy Dogg in ya life so can I hit ya
Later, cause its my time to wreck it
Say my praire, rock the crowd, bring home the checkered
Spend a little, save the rest another show again
No complaints from the dog 'cause I love them ends

Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen

I can feel love thumping at the doors of my heart again

Tek him to a discotheque
Tek him to a pub eh
Tek him to a blues and then
You play him rub a dub eh

Say you shouldn't really fight, man say
Say you shouldn't really fight
Each and every day I walk through the streets
And I see man and man war and kill each other

Because you are black or you are white
So what's the use in fighting?
War alright
Because it's strictly love and unity
We a deal in today

And that we will never throw away
We will never throw away, war alright
I say just because you're brown
You no fe g'wan like a clown

Just because you're white
You no fe broke a likkle fight eh
Say what's the use in fighting, boy

I am the king of the city, top down windows

Ridin' cause the haters face mad, team gritty
Honk your horn twice if your misses lookin' pretty

Well if you run wit your niggas, then I walk with my killas
Mo you will never have a winning hand, yeah as long as I'm the dealer
What you feelin' (uh) you sure you want some
Brought my slums, cats play like rums
Money in large sums, navigators and guns
Baby mamas wit sons
Ain't afraid to let you have it 
If you trip with their loved ones (you tripled your fare) 
What I hear most is no, no 
You best get on your mark, get set, go, go
Like Jagged Edge I leave ya more Def than So So
Type of person continue short sit in the front row
Get your hands out my pocket
You don't want just blow, blow
The only bird I get wit more is the doe-doe 
They be like oh, oh
It's what they screamin' from the back
Hey timber, is when I hit 'em wit the axe

When I step in my Prada I'm a rock the ice
When the 'Tics do a show I'm a rock the mic

Drive a SS M.C with racing stripes
Runnin two P's of L.G, flip it twice
Hang round with cats who bust and they don't think twice
Nothing but dome shots no coming back twice
All I knew was hustling and rolling the dice
Scraping up dimes for whole-orders of China Men Rice
Now I sacrificed my life for publishing rights
Hoping everything gonna be aight

Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga?
My last album was The Chronic (nigga)

They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it

I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it
After-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

I began as my fathers bright idea
A short time later 
They all watched in awe 
And all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark
But it was only because I was a believer
I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around 
And thought don't worry mama this city's gonna have you
Georgia
You'll always be home to me
Georgia
I belong to you
And yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on
Using mostly dirt roads
Until I find my way
Campbelton road
Cant forget cascade
There is somethin' about Atlanta that doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me.
And my old man is very stealth cant be mad now why bother?

New broad with a bra the top down
Chilling in the backseat screaming out loud

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, go get high myself this time

The cycle is Shawn Michaels (heartbreak),
And yeah I like you but not enough to wife you
You say I'm nice, true, and you think I'm the right dude
But there's another girl just like you (like who?)

And on the road, 'nother night, 'nother show
New e-vent in a new time zone
And the live show is so mind-blowin
And it's my show so you know I'm blown (you know)

No text's gonna give me head
Long distance just ain't my thing
Young single don't need no ring
I'm a free man now I don't need no strings, sing

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, Go get high myself this time

If you're cool with nights at the pool
Jacuzzi's and groupies, boobies and booze
And no rules, I'm only 22
I need to watch football and hang with a crew
But if you don't get mad when I get fat
Cause all I do is eat drink smoke weed and rap
And play Madden, then dag
You're pretty rad and I take it all back, come on

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, Go get high myself this time

Just keep clapping the hands, it feels good
Feels nice and warm in here right now
I'm feeling free
If you feel free clap your hands
Come on",Be by Myself [Instrumental],
Cee Lo Green,"And there's a, and there's a 
And there's a, and there's a fine, line 
Too late to pray that I'm on it
Ya yeah yeah 

Y'all, uh huh, y'all 

There's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Came way too late but baby I'm on it
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Can't wait too late but baby I'm on it
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see 
That's Liberation and baby I want it
Can't worry bout, what another nigga think 
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those) 
Many times I sit back and contemplate 
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm telling my story
My relationship, with my folks is give and take 
And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be 
It's left up to me, and my momma and 'em told me (yes she did) 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be 
Is left up to me, and my momma nem told me 

No, no, no
I'm so tired, it's been so long, struggling, hopelessly 
Seven and forty days, hey
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe 
To make you believe, I'd give my life away
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own 
All on my own, we
We alive but we ain't living, that's why I'm giving until it's gone 
Cause I don't want to be alone (I don't want to be alone) 
I don't want to be alone, yeah
Is there anything I can say to help you find your way 
Touch ya soul, make ya whole, the same for you and I 
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe 
We can fly but I can feel it in the wind 
The beginning or the end 
So people keep your head to the sky

Shake that load off, shake that load off

Folk in your face, you're a superstar 
Niggas hang around cause of who you are 
You get a lot of love cause of what you got 
Say they happy for you but they really not 
Sell a lot a' records and you roll a Benz 
Fall up in the spot now you losing friends 
All ya want to do is give the world ya heart 
Record label trying to make you compromise ya art 
You make a million dollars, make a million mo' 
First class broads treat ya like a nigga po 
You want to say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask 
Ya world starts spinning and it's moving fast 
Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to voice how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen 
Just by rapping

Smoke on it, shit, choke on it

Poppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone

Grab the rope and yell rawhide
Front line is pussy, call off sides

Yo, but on the floor tied
Don't matter, we'll take up all size

Since five, I talk jive
In church dressed in cordoroy ties

Besides, I'm just a sight for soar eyes

Stolen Bonneville in New York High

Reversin' the plot

If I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot

Hot as it gets, from Hell came outta you debts
Buy the cassette, rewind it to death

How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz

Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse

Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song

You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit

Cee Lo Green,"Yeah, yeah, Space Age forever; Niggas and hos better recognize 
Eightball and MJG, been ten toes down in this game 
Since we were two young playas in a one-horse town 
Then hopped to a muthafuckin' grasshopper 
Nigga, my life would have been done got cut off
If my dues weren't paid

It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right 
Trapped in a trap till the mornin' light 
Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight 
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made 
Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played 
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

In the middle of doin' crime; it never stopped me from writin' rhymes 
It never stopped me from playin' music
God, but it didn't mean I had to use it 
It was obvious: I had to give up the streets for the beats 
Not knowin', but havin' faith on just how long that it would be 
Before I made it, before somebody picked up my tape and played it 
With a remark like, ""Hey, played that instrumental, you cat's got potential."" 
In the process of doing talent shows, parties, and mix tapes 
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates 
I can remember in the past closin' down at fast foods 
Strictly stickin' to my dreams, but feelin' like I'd be the last dude 
Who can make it in this rap; I thought that they ain't gon' see me in Memphis 
It was like a time they looked over Tennessee
And didn't know hip-hop was in us
To all my vets in the game, I got love; stay on your toes 
'Cause back in the days, I used to use your 4-5 instrumental to do my shows 
And, look, I was seventeen when I signed my first contract 
And about eighteen and a half when I signed my worst contract; we hurt from that 
And till this day they still distributin' our first tape 
Before Comin' Out Hard, now can you feel it? 
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose 
'Cause to get to where I am right now, I done paid my dues

Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played 
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

A c-note for a concert; I know that sounds preposterous 
Nigga, we didn't have a pot to piss 
So we got on stage, and we rocked the bitch
Fuck the cheese; I love to see my niggas in the front row 
Get buck wild, start a fight; the police make a nigga stop the show 
Niggas all in the parkin' lot, bustin' shots, fuckin' with hos 
Box Chevy with the spokes and vogues
Niggas didn't know shit about a twenty inch Mo-Mo 
Hard head, young nigga don't believe that shit till I see that shit 
See them heavyweight niggas; one day, I'm gonna be that shit 
Okay, everybody know everybody done sold dope, ran with a gang 
Pimp some hos and snorted a little coke, but, uh 
I'm space again, and we'll forever be 
Eightball, the fat mack, and M-J-fuckin'-G 
Turn the page from then to now, and we still grindin'
Small clubs and small towns think they bouncin', and we find them 
Put them on the guest list, make them pump their fist and get buck to this 
Make one of them weed smokin', gangsta bitches get fucked to this 
Expand, give all my true fans what they demand 
Do my part again and, uh, come out hard again, and, uh
Keep space again, and we'll forever be

And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down

Tell me, how long has it been
Is everything, everything alright my friend
You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real

Oh, do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Ooh, do you like the way

In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah, yo, check it

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryin' to hold on
To life. She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her, that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would of served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes
Your Power and Pride is beautiful
May God bless your Soul

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see 'em when they taking her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middle-sex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seat-less toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years in a hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would f been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes
Your Power and Pride is beautiful
May God bless your Soul

Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba.

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah
We're molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul

Freedom! You askin' me about freedom
Asking me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you
I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
Than about what it is, cause I've never been free
I can only share my vision with you of the future
About what freedom is
Uh, the way I see it
Freedom is, is the right to grow, is the right to blossom
Freedom is is the right to be yourself, to be who you are
To be who you want to be, to do what you want to do",A Song for Assata,2000

Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darling you make me loose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where I had to give your mama call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe lady luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like tony mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like billy blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging
And I like then redhot fila straight from walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you
'cause you push a big black buick, so fresh, so clean on them trues
Slum beautiful you's the would to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm loving the way them jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the god above
Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of god and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that god made you for
Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of now & laters cause
You're the sweetest thing on my head
And I'd like to say that I'd love to
Make love to every molecule of you
And if you want to spontaneously combust
That's what we'll do in unison",Slum Beautiful,2000

She has shown a blatant disregard for the law
And has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty
For the vicious acts
She should be punished to the fullest extent of the law

Pardon me your honor
May I address the bench?
They try-na assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt
* Coughs
Excuse my persona
I may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dalmer
Ever since I killed ?em
I ain't been in trouble since
It wasn't my fault I acted out of self-defense
He killed my best friend
(Who's him?)
I mean them
They was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too
They had real grenade bombs inside of their palms
And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom
(Stop!)
I heard three guns cocked that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top
(Oh she's lying!)
Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor
Fingerprints all on the door
Need I say more?
Pulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow
Ploom! Queen off her toes
They fell down like dominoes
I think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix
What was I do?
Sit back and just take this?

If I lose this debate

Cee Lo Green,"Around me, bringing down, ah yea yea yea yea yeah
Life

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts

Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things

Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin'
Cats posin' as my fan just to get grabbin' what's mine

I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' off beats
Claimin' laws of the streets, but who made the laws?
Everybody playin' rebel with no sign of a cause

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
Where you want to go with your life
With your life

I'm never singin' the blues but findin' the clues to maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
I had, and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin' the clue

To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin' traps
Tryin' to find the goal, without havin' any maps
Even friends of mine, jumped online, just to become my adversary

They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come to chill or behave
 
And they got, toast ready to burn
Not learnin' to live, but they yearnin' to take what you earn

Well I feel the world around me
I've found, that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with your life
With your life

So quick to place blame, and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weighed, that I made and shaped
When I climbed I found

It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realize the truth
The biggest suppressor could be your own ego lookin' for an excuse
To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow

To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
And when I'm watchin' the news, and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask, 'Why were all those people on the floor
Sleepin', covered in red?' I told her
That they were lookin' for God, but found religion instead

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life

Oh, bring you down
Sometimes, you got to walk alone, alone
Oh, yeah, I need, ooh, to breathe
I need my space, to live
Y'all know, y'all know, oh

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life

Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em

You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun

And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke

Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South

Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

Cee Lo Green,"Um hmm, okay, okay, yeah
Yeah, y'all thought I lost it

In no fashion have I lost my passion for the pen
It's just that lately life has been a lost less inspirin'
To tell you the truth trials and tribulations is very tirin'
I gotta play a little game of gimmick and gun firin'

I'm not aspirin' to be any lower or higher than
I get equal as in eye to eye again
I'm the truth, I'm complicated, I'm all ready but try again
I've got to die once to never ever die again

And what I believe within, I engrave within my skin
And one thang that I ain't is a saint without a sin
How could there be a now if there never was a then?
That is unbalanced just like the yang without the yen

I am distinguishably deeper as opposed to the paper-thin
And I breathe oxygen, and you rhymin' 'bout rocks again
You stagnant, standin' still enough to feel the world spin
I'm beginnin' to smell the end in the path of the blowin' wind

Hopefully I'm fortunate enough to spend forever with a friend
I'm slow dancin' with destiny every day until then
When I first got my big break, I said that I would never bend
And discredit my character to keep up or contend

And my belief beat baseline secrete such a special blend
I am not like them at all and I cannot pretend
I am not like you at all and I cannot pretend

Damn, that shit was funky
Ooh, heard that nigga?
Damn, Shawty Lo, c'mon

I get off on an extension or compare comprehension
I'm in a classroom of my own, I'm too far gone for competition
Yet I'm never obnoxious with my obvious ambition
Perfectly imperfect is my dimension's definition

I engage my pen pierce the page so that it bleeds my intention
With honorable mention of God's divine intervention
I'm incredible, I'm inevitable and there's no possible prevention
I'll hardly scream my dream and I'll have your undivided attention

The powers that be will be beaten into submission
And you will be able to see my revolution on television
You'll get an aneurysm fuckin' around with my head on collision
With the power to get you dead and half the dead risen

I remember when my development was arrested
I was doin' time on my mind misguided and misdirected
I was sick, so sick if I spoke to you, you'd be infected
Then my conscience was cleared of all charges
And I came out corrected

Reinvented, refined, replenished and well rested
On a mission for a medium to manifest the thoughts I collected
After that everythin' I breathed upon, I blessed it
I committed crimes of passion and my soul was suspected

But it was thrown out of court
'Cause of course the Creator and I connected
He told me, "" Fear not for thou art protected
Your life is being requested and you are being tested
So make every attempt you can to expect the unexpected""

Mm mm mm boy that Lo boy
Damn, oh, Lawd, Cee-Lo, why you do it like that?
You ain't have to bustin' all like that, man
Makin' these 'lil rappers feel like they can't rap
Damn, I got some more, I got some more if you want some

I am internally, evolving, entirely
Extensive, eclectic, expression, eloquently
Instantly innovative, courageously creative
I'm driven, this God given gift it comes naturally to the native

Not a need for the dramatics or the systematics
Simplicities, strictly science and mathematics
The mastermind of the mighty, mystical and magical moves
And metaphors manifests masterpieces

Thoroughly fury through the inner mind's eye
Establishes this syn-thesis, of these innermost, insightful
Intriguin' interpretations of extreme intelligence
My commonsense is no co-incidence

Caution, competitors approach carefully I'm able to see
Rare ranges of distance, I expect respect
There's no tolerance for negligence, never, you'll forever
Feel the wrath of the pure and powerful poetry, permanently

Pre-meditative, political, critical, compellin', story-tellin'
Definin' desire, faith fuelin' the fire brilliance, prophylactic
Philosophical, psychological willingly wagin' warfare
Withstandin', commandin', demandin'
The listenin' ears to hear what God's forcin'

Instead endorsin' education ,equality, not hate
Just revolution of the mind state, not mere words but emotions
Which is essential, influential provin' my people's potential
Militancy, innocence, insight, listen to God then write
Since my birth date I been tight, shit

Damn, damn
Now, I don't want never hear nobody else say

Damn, he he he, now can I do my shit?

Been selfish once or twice
I had to learn how to sacrifice

Experiment and enter the internals of the inner me
The art of gone, and heart of stone, and own's worst enemy

Intellect shapeshifta, God's gift a Soul slippa
Hone in on clones and blow them out of my zone
International Fanatical, the radical tactical movements
Sounds are congruent to it

Work

It is what it ain't to these, infected disease
Thought of automatons deceived, by the deceptions indeed
Who mechanically breed at methodical speeds
Distorting your genes, aborting your dreams

Come on let's go and then I'll show how to beat down a rhyme
And wrestle a tempo
Hold on tight, but still let yourself go

Work

This is what I'm talking about
Should I begin to spit it just like the wind
Show my power take flight and quickly ascend
Like a bird beating my wings to the pulse of nature
Scaring spiritual devils while evoking the maker
Is it wrong for me to curse in the name of right
Is it wrong for me to spit life into this mic
That's all I'm asking baby
How come the new millennium brings fright
Something wicked approaches tonight

What good is a call on the phone if you can't speak
And you find it hard to breathe
Paralyzed by my essence, mere presence I put forth
Inherently legends record all souls of expressions
Evil as evil does, better than good was
A spirit of music that once was, born out of the pool of your love
Baby I'm an agent with a flow that's so contagious
And all and all true patience, my brotha Lo told me makes for perfection
While you feeling bound by this matrix
That's why when it comes to protecting mine
I'm a brother you can call over zealous
And I lust and thrust out my staff and wet
Till the motherfuckin' rains get jealous

You Gotta Work

It's not coincidental I use my soul for a stencil to outline the rhyme
That connects machine and a mind
Until the end of time the one my kind, the message will now be profoundly
Spoken, rules are meant to be broken, therefore it's my pleasure to mentor
But once learned you must learn you must yearn to discern
The mechanical glitch of artificial intelligence
But the consequence of your ignorance is the reality I now see before me:
""maybe in time we'll see""

Don't Stop, Work

The truth will unfold uphold until the end

Hello! I go by the name of simply Cee-Lo Green
How do you do? Welcome
I thought I'd seize this opportunity to tell you
A little more about myself if you don't mind
This is my vision, you know what I'm saying?
Check me out now

I have millenniums of material and rivers of rhythm
An entire ocean of emotion that's enlightening to swim in
Also a forest of feeling, beaten paths of peace
Trapped inside my silhouette, I have to speak to release
Demanding more from the pen than I whore from the pen
The line between playing to win and sin is thin
But I walk it with grace and I talk it with taste
I am that raw, simply put and I rest my case

It's elementary, yet far more than resources to pay the rent for me
Everything that I've done is divine, ask God, he'll tell ya, yeah, he mine
So, you see, you don't need another thug out of me
That is the last thing I plan to be on this LP
But I'ma go slip into something mo' comfortable and continue the lesson
No inconvenience at all, I insist on leaving an impression

So relax and ride out
Relax, okay and ride out
Just relax and ride out
Players, relax and ride out

I also solicit visual verbalism worth a visit
Intensely exquisite artism inquire all, who is it?
It's a deliciously daring delicacy I eat to exist
Oh, he's waving those words, I want seconds and thirds
Oh, hush, that's awful kind of you, you're making me blush
I could use some competition but they not making me much
Man, this beat is like my master, it's making me bust
Hip-hop is suffering, meaning I'm a necessity, if nothing

But you like every other rapper, cornrows and a bandana
But I get a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check
Every three months off Santana
Don't you fuck up, though my family is the whole side of Atlanta
Now how can I say? Okay, let me just put it this way

If anyone ever contests my conquest, my gun best
Yo son, just takes one time to be one less
'Til you run and tell the rest that I'm the best
I sang sweet but brang heat to bang meat
We all on the same street

And it's not that often I verbalize the essential element of surprise
I am not one of these thug rapper guys
But this one will help you realize and use both eyes to recognize
The type of action that this amount of money buys
Now listen son, let me drop some shit on you man
I can just 'do-do-do-do-do-do-do' and put a hit on you, man
With hot heat that will make your heart beat quit on you man
And Mr. Dawson'll find a pretty box to fit all you man

So relax and ride out
Just relax, young man and ride out
Hey, you better relax and ride out
Okay? Just relax and ride out

I could take that shit all day
But if I only had sixteen more bars to live
I'd get high and hopefully O.D. on an alternative
I'd give a dim lit dream, a color scheme
And I'd swim for the sun so far

No matter how impossible that may seem
I'd bury my feet in the foundation of a forest
Becoming one with everything there
I would be long, I would be right and wrong but I'd be rare
And then I would pretend I didn't care
Use my fear and pray that my forever would be fare

And I love you all, unconditional, I get misty already missing y'all
And then I forgive those who rhyme to kill the time
While mine cultivate the consciousness
And chill the spine, heal the mind, yet still sublime

Ride out, relax and ride out
Relax and ride out

And all of a sudden a sailor becomes a star constellation
Your eyes offer an invitation
And I guess that it's more of crime wasting irreplaceable time

Hey there young man
It seems like your sight's been blinded
Oh, how I wish you could see
The very life that you're lived been tailored by many
An' mixed in ability

Oh, I wish you'd do more than just keepin' it real
Why don't you try bein' true?
One song could save the life
Of the young ones dependin' on you
Hey, young man

Hey, young man, I understand why you so angry
I grew up exactly the same
Daddy was gone, so you had to find your own way
An' he's convenient to blame

Despite those circumstances, don't you stop standin'
Don't give up whatever you do
'Cause just like you once were
Now your son is dependin' on you
Hey young man

Hey there young man, why degrade your only sister
An' call them bitches an' whores?
What if one day someone feels the same way
About that daughter of yours?

Oh, if you had one inklin' of an idea
Of what they had to go through
Of course she's strong
But she's still dependin' on you
Hey young man, hey young man

Well, well, well, well

Just got to trust me even though I'm blind

Are you there yet?
Do you even care yet?
Leave that forever as long as your fears are far behind
But first you got to trust me
This is your destiny it must be
So take my hand I've seen the promised land even though I'm blind

Follow me, follow me, follow me
Ooh, I can set you free if you
Follow me, follow me, follow me

So why not believe in me?
Because of everything, you've probably seen

Cee Lo Green,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Telling it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love making
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watching Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the Creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you 
[Chorus]

He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you 

[Chorus]

Cee Lo Green,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere,2002

How can I possibly, be inconspicuous
When my flow is fuckin' ridiculous?
That's right an accent, see I'm from the south
Where some of the most beautiful things come out my mouth
And I'm on stage just as soon as I come out the house
So I might as well give them somethin' to talk about
I bust a rap to make a blind man believe in the boogey

It all went as it should
And you were having the greatest moment in life (yeah)

'Cause it is heavenly joy
When you wake up Christmas morning to every toy
Then there's the birth of my boy
Here to inherit the rhythm
And when I see it in him I ask myself what more can I give him?
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep living
Hey, ooh when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming I'm shining my light
And although the love is so blinding I still end up finding my wife
All I can do is reminisce 'cause there eyes no rewinding my life
But the future's so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

It's like all a sudden your life is so cool

Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We living, breathing, soon we'll be teething
Our granny got a goal and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages

Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again

Good does not come without pain

That don't belong to us
I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
But Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thing, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle

Guess what, guess what

Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Listen to me
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right
You'll get used to singing if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playing Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting

",All Day Love Affair,2004
Cee Lo Green,"Hey now here we go let's start the show
Suppose you know to call me 'Lo
But you can call me The Soul Machine
Watch â?? Hey yeah â?? See what I mean?

Four million flavors of the southern soul flower
But the power that you get from the heart of a human being
Only the mind is mechanic the dynamic happens
When the divine starts to intervene

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
But ""Come save me,"" said this last fiend
'Cause the beginning and the ending and the misassumption
Will make 'em move something in between

[Bridge]
It's like I'm standing on my tippy-toes to touch a star (a star)
Trying to catch joy in other's jar
And yes by far I'm so much further than they are
Hey

[Chorus]
Turn the radio on, let the music play
If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, fifth around it's another day

When you see me you would know that you saw me
Because he always got on his game and his good shoes
Difficult to stop creating can't wait
But they came to see God then great tell 'em the good news

Isn't it ironic how it feels so good?
But I was only just singing the blues
I wouldn't open my mouth about it at all
If I thought that I was only just singing the fool

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Maybe 'Lo you should lighten up
I really would if I could

But I really don't think that anybody shell out enough
And I really think true wealth is home and happiness and health
A little cash and you'll need nothing else
And as far as me being good, I can't help myself
Hey

[Chorus]

So when you really really need you some soul
I mean dead serious damn near bout to die bout some
Don't be too proud to turn your radio way up loud
Close your eyes and have fun

I used to feel like God was gonna call me too soon
The reason why I had to have my son
And every time I've ever opened my mouth and said something
Bout living was to earn my ones

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Wait I'm almost done
And God can truly work a miracle â?? Look at me

Isn't it obvious that I'm one?
And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free (I'm free)
And this my own little thing yes I agree

But don't you want your kids to grow up to be just like me?
Hey

[Chorus]",The Art of Noise,2004

Come on
Chop chop
Mmm hmm
Yeah man
I'm just gonna play with why'all on this
Hidey ho

Well hello, howdy do, how are you, that's good
Who me, still hot, I still got, you got me nigga
I'm here, I'm there, cause I'm wrong, cause I'm right
I can spit on anything, got plenty game, authentic
My pen's sick, forensic, defends it, he wins it
Again and a, again and a, again and a, again and a
I'm the one, come see, lookey I, and come meet
The young Cee, the one treats everything the sun seek
I'm hollering, can't help, I'm hungry
I cake rap, bake rap, sack rap, trap rap
Same shoes, same shirt, the same work, the same jerk
Claim hurt, the game hurt, my name work, it ain't work
I'm fast, time fast, I'm first, I'm last
Psychic, I knew you would like it, like this
I write this, priceless, more then my right wrist
Cock back, block track, the beat bleed, speak read
Men eat weed, bead seed, I speed read, you need me
To give it to you like you want it, I own it when I'm on it
Maintain the same thing, nigga rap about the same game
None left, shame shame, plain game, insaine
When I rap things change, me and God, same thing
Money's here, money fold, I'm young, money old
Maybe look, cross hanging down to my tummy toes
I know it, I'm a stop, I'm trying just like life

Yes I can sing, and I can rap
And I can act, and I can dance
And I can dress, sign of the best
So is my guest, man I'm impressed
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Little melody and a little drum
All I really need to have a little fun

Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha

[Ludacris]
Who the only little nigga that you know with bout fifty flows
Do about fifty shows in a week but creep on the track with my tippy toes
Shhh, shut the fuck up, I'm trying to work
Ah forget it, I'm going berzerk
Cause I stack my change, and I'm back to claim
My reign on top, so pack your thangs
I rack your brain like crack cocaine
My fame won't stop or I'll jack your chain
Give it up, ding ding ding, thanks, the price was right
That gray goose got me loose, but my eyes are tight
It's the truth, give me a light like I'm dynamite
Alright, alright, we goin ride tonight
I'm so dangerous that I gotta bang with this
You could be famous or remain nameless
Better just drop down to your knees, call upon the lord and pray
Better luck next time, cause you want to open that door today
Your hair sorta gray, it's that sorta day
Flowing so hard over this track and I got more to say
I ain't new to this, I'm so true to this
See what you get fucking with Cee-Lo and Ludacris

Haha
Okay, there you have it little kids
Wasn't that fun?
Yeah
Saturday morning, Cee-Lo Green and my man Ludacris
Doing this thing, ATL style
This is childs play
Seriously though
I can rap bout any you guys with my tongue tied
Ha ha ha
Don't make me get serious on your ass
You wouldn't like me when I'm serious
I could have said anything I want to",Childz Play,2004
Cee Lo Green,"See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

Before we came being in southern wasn't something to claim
The fact wasn't something too fly it was something to blame
Smilin' and juckin' and jivin' I was so ashamed
They gave the dirty apparently appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind my ambition was blind
Answering the call of God like a child obeying
Preaching the very same power they killed Martin for saying

But you can't break the mold and not holding your breath
Thought if I died for ya, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up in tear
And it's clear my music may not do well up in here
Oh my God being a nigga must be a good payin' job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and the place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past my heart is still broken look
I know you don't hate me it's not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my album's lately
In recent news the source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words I could scream an alternative to equate me
Which is true I'm in a box with a view would you still wanna date me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me

The final cross to bear is mine it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still woulda bought a cross to wear
That obviously cost to wear but considerably less
Than the price that it costs to care
Now I have another loss to spare I doubt 'em say that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you just can't bend
So me and J J both gon' have to pay bills

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

Listen, people still standin' in line at the world party for some soul food
To get put back in that old mood they say, we like the new 'lo
And we respect everything that you trying to do 'lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
Now I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie

Cussed 'em said that I'm too dope and I couldn't fly
But you getting rich talkin' shit so why shouldn't I
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gon' ride this revolution until they stop me where I'm stayin'
But I ain't gotta have to lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'",Die Trying,2004
Cee Lo Green,"And now, the night time

Late in the evening
There is the thieving and the trickin' and the trappin'
And they ain't actin'
We make it happen
We'll get the guns on anyones and get to clappin'
Even for rappin'
Does it surprise ya?
We'll readjust and reconcile and recognize up
That I'm a writer
Oh yes I write up
Now open wide and let me put the night inside ya

This is music usually confused with major motion picture
No one is stricter about it being status for scripture
No put on your gut is goin', you're wearin' what don't fit ya
You better run little one, 'cause the rhythm's gonna getcha
And when it hits ya, it usually hits somebody with ya
Make 'em risk a total eclipse of sun to get richer
Baby, a little time and something fine that'll fix ya
With shield love you forgot to remember to miss ya
The nightlife, the dark side of the city
Gon' be on 24 inches, and be defenseless
The nightlife, the dark side of my heart
Where no one really knows you, and no one supposed you
The nightlife, the dark side of my soul
Where if somebody crossed you, kill 'em up off you
The nightlife, the dark side of the moon
Where the sun is scared to come
(Give me some) ha

Take me where the darkness is still beautiful

Oh, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Give me the night
The night is gonna getcha

Hey it's gonna getcha
Give me the night
The night is gonna getcha
Ah it's gonna getcha

I'll be your lady
Fairweather friend
I'll be honest
And I'll pretend
I'll act like I love ya, oh
I'll act like I love ya, oh

You gotta listen to me now (give me some now)

Take me where the darkness is still beautiful

I've been runnin' since rock box
I've cocked Glocks and locked blocks and rocked rocks
And dropped tops
The obviously odd, five foot six inch God
In the flesh
I've been the best
I'll get in your chest and in the mess
In your vest and out your back without even getting out the 'llac
I lied about how I really handled that situation about the Ac'
I'll hit back
If your lead was the only collateral you got I'll get back
Now get flat
Say a prayer cause shorty want this shit back
Sit back, this chit-chat is pitch black
But you can still see what I'm sayin'
And heavy is how I weigh in
Niggas love singin' sad songs about how bad they want to stay in
Either hold out on basketball playin or make use of some yay' then

Whoo whoo
Lord sho feel good to me
I promise, I promise
Not to ever, ever leave this night life alone
This me
Me too (yup)
This me
And me three (have mercy)

Take me where the darkness is still beautiful

Oh, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Give me the night
The night is gonna getcha
Ahh it's gonna getcha
The night is gonna getcha
Ah it's gonna getcha
Give me the night
The night is gonna getcha
Ahh it's gonna getcha
The night is gonna getcha
Ah it's gonna getcha
Give me the night

Brother... you've been on my mind
Oh brother
We've changed over time so
Brother, I'm keeping my eyes on you
I bet you don't think I know no bett'(er)
But sanging the blues
Oh but brother have I got news for you
I'm something... and I know you know that I'm something too
(chuckle)

Yeah, usually I don't get into all this battle rap shit and all that
Shit's stupid
But I'm gonna address it
And after I get it off my chest may God bless it
I will invest four minutes exactly for everyone who had the audacity to attack me

I kept quiet but perhaps I should have pushed this fire quicker
Cause to just sit with this shit I've only gotten sicker
Yet I react without even a crack in my composure
But the only way he knows to bring this shit to a closure
I'm worthy, and my associates and I named the South Dirty
And I'm even for sale in Braille, the deaf, dumb and blind have heard me
But I ain't even breathin until I get an even 30
I could casually clap up the front of somebody's throwback jersey
You makin' me hafta talk this way, aintcha?
You makin' me hafta talk this way
You forcin me to walk this way
Maybe my album will get bought this way
Niggaz slow down around me, I make em superstitious
And one of my vices used to be wanting to look visually vicious
But instead I use my head and I fed niggaz something nutritious
But you will appreiciate what a sacrifice this is
And I know you ambitious young men, you have my best wishes
Have a piece of this pain on a platter, it's one of my best dishes
When you assassinate my character, not one remark misses
So it's gone get funky when I'm fryin these little fishes
Fuck fakin, there has been some offense",Glockapella,2004
Cee Lo Green,"I am the music
I've yet to define myself as just, one thing
Let's just say that

I am the actual and factual supernatural sight and surrounds
Signification of conversation
Two or more words rhyming in song form or spoken syncopation
The reason the rudery reanimation and realization of life is rhythm
I am the heartbeat and the heartache, the here and now

I am the purpose, the point, the living proof of a God somewhere
The lifeline, lifelike lazer beam, the progression and direction
Always will be always was what all comes from and all must return
The center of a perfect circle, I am your soul

Music of your mind, each feeling causing each function
To be in conjunction with the music, I am the music

I am the music

Let's get started shall we? 'Cause you know it's time gone
Every time these n****z rhyme wrong
So uhh, lights, camera, action I'm on
I'll have them standing in line to get their mind blown

I'm selling soul, rapping and singing, and screaming, and yelling soul
Manufacturing, marketing, pricing, packaging and e-mailing soul
With no rehearsal, this one verse'll whole hearse you
Now a commercial but what I must first do

Is make my presentation a bit more personal
Everything must go for a small price you can have the heart of me
There is no part of me that can't be calculated into a commodity
My musings amount to a milestone a million miles above monotony

And it'll make you feel so good, it got to be God, it got to be
I paint prophecy, you know airbrush atrocity with philosophy
And people ask me am I gon' preach one of these days
And I just tell 'em, ""Possibly"", if you let me

I'll end up being everything probably and obviously
It's like any other job would be so you might as well thank God for me
But isn't it amazing, how the antenna ain't nothing but a sinner
You just can't go and be ordained over dinner

Now I can interest an intellectual or A be see it for a beginner
But yes my seasons still change and it is almost winter
And it give it to you at God-speed but yet it's gentle
And when I rhyme I make reading fundamentals

Or even black and white, my lyric is live and living color
My flow if fluorescent like scripture highlighted in bright yellow
And all this for 999, s*** that's wonderful
And the great thing about it is, if you disagree you're money's refundable

But there's always something rewarding about every Cee-Lo Green Recording 'cause even after all your expenses
People still aspire affording
It's incredible how convincing I can be with a camera pointed at me
But really sometimes rapping feel like tapping to make a cracker happy

But when the dat play and the beat get bumping like adolescent acne
It's kinda sad but it's show time, my sentiment exactly
So don't get mad, everybody's doing it, you know you wouldn't mind
A commercial with your own tennis shoe in it

Whether you're selling a dream, selling a scheme or playing a role
Like it or not we're selling soul

Well, I'm so human, it is a goddamn shame, I'm your thing
And I'm not sure that I'll always keep us in pain, yes sir

And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Said stand up, everybody, uh, this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters
The lovers who ain't here
You only got one life, y'all, and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going

Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
'cause ignorance is bliss and ignorance is just so fucking ignorant
You may even be ignorant of this
If you say so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin', still fuckin', so fools don't make a dish
Light a candle for love, blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish

I see you looking lil' girl, let's go get lost then
Every so often out on and off them (I wanna go shit and you know this)
Well is there anyone else that you could go with
Cool run it back OK, see if she'll play wit Pha

You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!

'Bout ten mo minuets and I'm ready to ride
I got ten mo bitches Imma fit up inside
This suburban or Excursion or whatever I ride
I bet it's chrome on the wire, vogue on the tire
T.I.P. refer to me as your majesty or sire
Higher then the rest, Italian drop dead fresh
So much say what I feel with southern finesse
So debonair if he dare bet he got best dressed
Full length mink, gator belt gator vest including shoes
A ten thousand dollar outfit bitch
Yes, dude he dress to impress
A bitch enough to make her want to give me her dress
Blessed with the gift of gab to get gals
Hot enough to hit they pals so get down
You looking good enough to come give me a kiss now
Get a room at the Swiss big as a beach house

You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

You're lookin nice. Hell, let's toast to the broken ice
We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say
I really did miss you the last time that you went away
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time
She said ""You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you""
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same
So she knew she was gon' come before she came

You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!(Girl did you know that ahh...)

It's our privilege, to have had this conversation
It's our privilege, and to have had this relation
It's our privilege, I been searching all evening
For somebody who can and finally sent me the one
It's our privilege, to have made you laugh
It's our privilege, and to have crossed your path
It's our privilege, your the star yes you are
Can have your autograph cuz you lookin like the one
It's our privilege, to have seen your face
It's our privilege, and I bet you taste so good, let's get one thing understood
I'll be good yes I would, especially for the one
It's our privilege, let have a head-on collision
It's our privilege, girl you made the right decision

Peace
How why'all feel out there
That's cool
Alright
You know, sometimes I want to rap
Sometimes I want to sing, you know what I mean
Sometimes all it calls for is a nice mellow groove
Hit of rimshot, you know
Just get, you know, get you open
But I want to do a piece for why'all tonight, it's called sometimes
Alright, so check it out

Sometimes a stranger can be your best friend
Sometimes being angry is the best mood
Sometimes seeing you feel good makes me feel even better
Sometimes hunger is the best food
Sometimes good just ain't good enough
And other times evil will get you even
Sometimes faith is not knowing any better
Sometimes nothing is what you believe in
Woah

Sometimes I don't even want a hit
Sometimes you fail trying
And sometimes happiness hurts worse
Sometimes people live dying
Sometimes it's the last person that makes you first
Sometimes you'll keep what you don't want
And other times you'll give away what you really need
Sometimes a rich man won't have a dollar
And all a poor man has is greed
Woah

Sometimes
Sometimes I just want to listen
Sounds good to me
Yeah
Ay yo Lock, put them strings right here
Sometimes I don't think people know I'm as good as I really am

Now my recitings are writing over rhythm's
Regularly reenacts facts of my existence
So what proof of my expertise, many emcees know of me
Using unrequested serious infested poetry
To prevoke what persistence
For instance, I don't let the T.V. screen come in between my daily routine
At a spot where me and my boy went
Someone interrupted our enjoyment
What do you know, an out of work emcee looking for employment
But I'm still courteous with my greeting, brother I'm eating
And his style sounded similar to someone elses
So evidently he's been cheating
But I couldn't question the destiny in which we meet
So, you guessed it, I suggested that he just have a seat
And then I explained to him that I remained in the mean time
Mastering mysterious methods of writing
Finding my piece of mind with soft music and moonlighting
Then supernaturally I foresee the beginning stages
And then eventually pages get filled completely
You see, I dive into the depths of my soul
Seeking to explore the hidden treasure of a pure literature
While these others are unsure
Being that the deepness makes them doubtful
Deliberately delaying
Saying they'll settle for whatever washes toward the shore
Delirious from delusion
My feelings were no more direct so the conclusion is seclusion
Because mixed belief create confusion
To remain plain and simplistic, realistic
Accurate, articulate and absolutely artistic
Uninhibited, unadulterated, unstoppable
Unfuckwittable and unforgettable
But since I've been granted the power of choice
Let God bet the voice he is
So all the credibility be his
So let these be words of wisdom and in the same breath be warning
God I shine like Sunday morning
Woah

See you next time",Sometimes,2004

He's bad, he's Cee Lo Green
But you can just call him the soul machine

Now I came here for you to love, it's computer love
I make them cut through the rug when I do the club
I can take some mental electric sex, refuting love
But Gunplay will be graphic if I do the thug

The day to day experience is the data that I download
And then remaster onto a rapture
Abracadabra before and after, over and over
Losing account of all the dreams that I sold ya

But then I gave ya, at the speed of light trying to save ya
Then I go and now come back a row, whoa
And oh I'm technic to God in a fashion
But you can just call me Lo Go

Whenever you want some soul
Start him up
Whenever you need some soul
Start him up

See he's been given the power
To take you wherever you want to go
Start him up
And tell him what you want

Once you start up the soul machine
You will see what I mean
Open your eyes and enjoy the dream
He can do anything
He's bad

Cee Lo Green,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is hope!

I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I
Wish my brother would of made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, and I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, and I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die today,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin' of the joy I bring, (shit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin' lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me(I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone, and I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And no po-po bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly, and I
Wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breathe again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King why can't we all just get along?
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church and let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,

[Cee-Lo] I love sugar all of it
[T-Dubl] This one for all the clean, decent women
[Cee-Lo] Lay it on me girl

Gimme gimme some
She put it right there on my tongue (Skeet Skeet)
Right there on my tongue (She turns me on, like no other)

[Trick Daddy]
And gimme some of your butter pecan 
Put it right there on tip of my tongue, hold it
Right jeeeah
'cause baby, if I bite you
I bet you like it
French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me
With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream
The best things are the wet dreams

And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Or lee, I speak the truth
'cause the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
'cause, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'
Southern boys we crave for old slice of pie after they main course
So if you game for it
I came for it
I got a thing for ya
That I can't ignore

She put that sugar on my tongue, tongue
Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum
Goodie goodie gum drop
Put me in a tongue lock
Did it till my body went numb, numb
Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weed
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
'cause she wanted a man with a little sec-you're-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night
So put the bubbles in the tub and Ludacris in me

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeeeah Yeeeah Yeah 
Yeah Yeah

Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape cool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

Cee Lo Green,"Question for the ages
What's going on with my back pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm (come on)
It's the abstract Will's on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in here for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it be marveled on the speakers please
'Cause they gonna marvel and shake the ground
Break addles break the sound
Fill the embraceful pound
Treat all the things profound
If you wanna dude to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it could help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a

Steady jumpin' around like it's heavy cargo

From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
'Cause we show the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke birds but I'm still real nice with the birds
So fuck (hey!) what you heard

Talib, just hit 'em like that
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at ramming like my rap
It's like the yak is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this Will so I might get ill
On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake
My lyrics get out a split atom like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making you
Tss tsss tsss, I'm a roll with the hot
I'm a flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'm a simply simply always attach

Jump em' in the jump rope, double Dutch
Then turn on the mic with a thumb stroke
Subtle touch, cuddle, clutch, is this thing on
Like the fling with Mrs. King Kong, this spring gone?
Sing a song of slaphappy crappiness
He came to blow like it was strapped to his nappy chest
Surely I jest, the best on a wireless mic not an eye test,
Yet I di-gress
But why stress? Try an' remember when, maybe bit the tender skin-ned babysitter Gwendolyn.
The type to hit and run and go tell a friend
Word to El Muerto cucaracha, exoskeleton
He know, flow, like inter stellar wind,
Tow a rap Jinn, by his toe, into hell again
A-hem, One, two, check me too, loose wreck

Rap these days is like a pain up in the neck,
Cornier, and phonier than a play fight,
Take two of these and don't call me on a late night
The beat won't fail me, with more rhymes,
Than times he washed his hands and feet daily
And all that kerosene ain't cheap, Villain been deep
Since a teenage creep, peep
He always was a gentleman,
And kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
Right there, next to where the Rolodex was
Before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
He don't know his own strength, when he's on the bone
It's like the microphones length, and width, ain't it funky like dingy socks?
Feel the full effect off cassette in your Benzie Box.

Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat,
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5,

But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't go no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come fro no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?
It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
To get further away from where I've been
But I'll never gorget everythang I went through
I appreciate the shit because
If I hada went and took the easy way
i wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being tood for my soul

Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dripping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetty plus her monthly flow
They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marsha Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Somke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had allot but thankful for
The little that I got why not be
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they sick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable
Come an get your soul food well well..
Hold up see it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail 
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppis to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at tha beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family

Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features, 
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether,
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for, 
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh,
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper,
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle, 
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest, 
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project, 
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra,
It's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah,
(Yeah nigga, what.)

Nigga what,
From my voice I'm killing 'em,
I shed my blood,
About everything I love,

To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker,
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer,
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster,
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha,
I call it rich ignorant laughter,
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up,
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags, 
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra, 
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya,
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture,
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing, 
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her, 
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne,
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar, 
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,
(Yeah nigga, what.)

Nigga what,
From my voice I'm killing 'em,
I shed my blood,
About everything I love,

The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker, 
Pretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber,
Heister, my own life biographer,
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping, 
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers, 
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me, 
Draped in paisley bandannas,
Suits with Adam Stacey,
Cigar like Dick Tracy,
Its dark I get spacey,
Alcohol and laced weed,
That was part of my 80's,
The Cartier consigieres be near me,
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,
Liz Taylor tried to joke me
Cause I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be
When he gets mean, 
Think fast before I blast hoes,
Like Grassino, 
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion, 
And realest rappin',
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green,
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas,

Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us,

Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it?  Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window 
POW nobody now

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking got a hit of the blow it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
 
But every now and then, I wonder
If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Who's that peeking in my window 
POW nobody now

Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection

Genie eyes, light green, sipping on Bellini's
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch
She'll be a devil in disguise, lady incubus
Better know who to trust
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs

After bein' 25  you know  just trying to survive in the world 
Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows? 
Anyway  just when you start getting that little age and experience to you 
You start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves 
So bust it out  this is what I was thinking  check it 

Yo  the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn 
Began, began with time 
Being my bloodline is one with the divine 
In time brother, you will discover the light 
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White 
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right 
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear 
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear 
As a child, given religion with no answer to why 
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die 
Curiosity killed the catechism 
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to 
And became a slave to master self 
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health 
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons 
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital 
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys 
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief 
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em 
And use religion as an emblem 
When it should be a natural way of life 
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right 
That's who got you doing right and got you this far 
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah 
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you 
You let that show towards others in the things you do 
'cause when the trumpets blowing, 24 elders surround the throne 
Only 144,000 goin' get home 
Only 144,000 goin' get home 
Only 144,000 goin' get it baby 

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I've lived and I've learned 
I have taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I've cried 
I have failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
Found joy through all my pain 
I just want to be happy with being me 

[Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern 
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title 
That their actions didn't earn 
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence 
Subconsciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince 
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place 
Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know 
Who you are in the first place 
So I try to find the clue in you 
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do 
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden 
Damn, somethin' in me want to know who I am 
So I began my search, my journey started in church 
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief 
Hustling was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets 
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with 
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school 
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only 
Science and math are universal 
Taking elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran 
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites 
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White 
Some leads were granted with insight 
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to over stand 
He still created with the imperfection of man 
So, with followin' I disagree 
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but 
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind 
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas 
You goin' surely find there's no positivity without negativity 
But one side you gonna have to choose 
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse 
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession 
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and 
Can't follow your lesson 
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 

Well, I've lived and I've learned 
I've taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I have cried 
I failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
I found joy through my pain 
Just want to be happy, being me

Fallin in a crater
Of lost memories
I'm so out of hand
I don't even fuck with me
I'm goin trippin drunk and slippin
Sleepin in ditches
Switchin prescriptions
Bangin a random hoe and itchin
I don't give a flyin feces
I ain't one with the human species
Slappin the nurse tryin to up my cc's
I fall apart
Take all my pain turn it into art
Blowin up a K-Mart and blame it all on Mozart
Fuck I'm surprised I got a deal
Every two hours I take a pill
That's where I'm at,
Its all surreal
I got imaginary friends
An imaginary life
An imaginary wife
And a real knife
Out of here by next weekend
Hung over on the dresser with my brain leakin
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery
I think I'm losin my mind
I'm whacked out on jack and blacked out
Trapped in a crack house full of doubt
I got guilt to the hilt
I fight tears and fears
Been out for ten years
Hit a big bump up off the mirror
Find me at www dot
I came to trouble you dot
Come here mothafucka take your best shot
Suicidal
Got a lot of demons to fight
I'll probably sit in a chair and put my mouth around a rifle
I feel abused to lose the blues
I'll bring my booze
I'm in the who's who's
And dope fees and floozies in the land
Preparin for news
These niggas are never choosy
The morning sun is like a sledgehammer to my forehead
And I'm barely here
Look in the mirror every day and slowly disappear
Been through a million and 67 emotions in my short career
Riddles I fear
Staggered out in the street for beer awww fuck it
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery

Even though I'm standin still I can't stop storm chasin

So close to overdose that night the day hurts my eyes

Than four walls and a floor
But that's all that is mine
God give me a sign
'Cause I'm tryin and dyin at the same time
I'm not hesitatin
Just waitin
Heck yeah comin with a flurry
And like the spice up in you throat
I get ya chokin like that curry
Somethin bout the police and them lights that get me worried
Made a lap up on that bastard in a hurry
Flyin from the spirits so I got a story
The dude that taught me how to rap was Ray Murray

Cee Lo Green,"There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
If it seems like I'm shining it's probably
A reflection of something you already are

I forget about myself sometimes
When there's so many others around
When deep inside you feels the darkest
That is where I can always be found
That is where I can always be found
That is where I can always be found

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me

There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
If you try to reach out and touch me
You'll see that I'm not really that far

Oh, I may not be the brightest
Nor am I the last one you'll see
But as long as you notice
That's just fine with me
Everything's just fine with me
Everything's just fine with me

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me

There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
I'm running and jumpin'
But barely gettin', gettin' over the bar

I plan on being much more than that
And but that's in due time
But until then I'm guilty
And being human's my crime
Just being human that is my crime
Being human that is my crime

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it

Her body's going down see her ass crack to smile

Or some cat a mouse
And she was the cheese on the sun keys
Yeah on a conversation

Said she had drinks in the coller and I had an inventation

With distant gay traces

To tempt me to madness! 
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness 
Of a great love for me. 

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again, 
I was wrong. 

Life is lonely again, 
And only last year everything seemed so sure. 
Now life is awful again, 
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore. 

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it, 
All I care is to smile in spite of it. 

I'll forget you, I will 
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.

Yeahh
Straps? Bring the hook in
Doctor won't you come and help me take this pain away, away away.
Ohhh

Doctor give me what I need to get me through the day the day the day
I want that feel good, that feel good, that real good yeahhh x2
Doctor feel good help me
Lately I been beside myself and disenlikely to hide myself

It's not like I like being by myself
I wanna see the world but decide myself
Whether or not to get up off this couch
Whether or not to get up out this house

I wanna know what it's like to feel real good
Is there something you could perscribe dr feel good
I mean he's so happy she's so free
Doctor what in the world is wrong with me

I just need some ressurance
I know my carrier won't be insurrin' this
If you could just be ernest
Oops I meant honest and make this promise

If any of this makes sense doc I know I wasn't crazy just thoroughly convinced
Go

[Chorus]
She got a set of lips like a sedative
Everytime I kiss her it's like medicine
Somethin's? nope don't let it?
Cause everytime I do I end up upset again
Haha
And then it's back to the waitin' room
Waitin' patiently for them to bring another patient to him
Anything is possible especially when you see it in the hospital
I hope dr feel good can fix me and help me find?

I made a detour quickly I tailed it to the exit door quickly before they could get me
It didn't take much to loose 'em
But before I got home I came to a conclusion
If feelin' means another appointment take?
And don't expect to call in the morning

How's everyone doing?
You are now in the world I'm ruining.
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous cluster fuck 
Of fun and enchantment.
I promise this some generation X shit.
Speak for the seller who I left with.
Parallel levels in a dark dark place.
Tripped all you niggas to a dark dark fate.
The guy you are with a smile upon my face.
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently.
Gentle with the drugs. Heavy with the love.
I'ma spit this on stage, watch models fill my club.
I wanna see more of the world
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia.
I wanna see more of the world.

I hope you understand what you're hearing.
Take a minute to hold up for the wondrous clusterfuck, 
The darkness and evil.
I will play the ying and the yang for ya 
And my jeans will be off with the little skinnies.
Updated. Fitteditted to the T. 
Work hard. 
Makin' sure I don't become my memory.
Hard to press on when the memories remember me 
And they always find the perfect moment.
High speed. I'm a minimal storm I'm lost in the wind. 
I've lost all my friends.
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted.
Money seems to make everything tainted.
Everybody mad cause they stuck. 
One room less.
Took what I wanted 
And I did it all blunted. Oh oh.

No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin
Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much
Staring in the streets so I don't sleep much
Watching the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin' dis money niggas cant keep up
You niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it cant be much
I'm still walking through the crowds like I cant be touched
Top back all black Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the muthafucka'
No insurance on a muthafucka'
Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody knows I'm a a lot of people's threats
Biggie smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me lord will I be poor and broke
Tell me lord will I be dealing dope
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only lords knows

To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god, I'm scarred
I have tattooed tears of joy

Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Young rich muthafucka' still uneducated but dammit a nigga made it
God damn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers Lord know I'm stressed
A punch in the face get you 300 K
Ask Blair Knight he back makin' minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimming in ice
I'm just living my life
I'm just living my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next mournin' I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste

Goodbye
To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god I'm scarred
I have tattooed tears of joy

Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this
Not to dwell on the the past
But to keep it real I gotta represent for Emmitt Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin' at my Rolly it's about that time
White man got a problem wit' mine
And we suppose to be shy
The revolutions televised
Bobby still on the rise

Goodbye
To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind

The light of love has gone out, and now your shadow's gone away
You took away the sound, the touch, the smell, my sight, to see your smile

Please, no pity for a G
Though I've got a son that I barely get to see
I see him for an hour. After that he's gotta leave
On top of that, I only get to see him once a week
Yea, right, lucky me
Well fuck child support and whoever disagrees
I learned a valuable lesson, indeed
But I'm just trying to be the best father I can be
Apparently I'm an unfit father, cause all I know is dope
And all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
Cause no 9 to 5 is gonna prevent us from starving
I'm sorry Jaylin, I don't get to see you like I want to
But I just wanna let you know I want to
If the court grants me visitation, them I'm going to
But you're to young to understand what we're going through
And your mama's low down
She's just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me, she knows she's gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do. She don't understand that this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court, so either way, it's a lose - lose
I tried talking to the bitch, but she keeps using you as a bargaining chip
And I am not the one to be bargaining with
That just makes me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch
I swear this shit ain't even right bruh
I ain't even got a chance to change your fucking diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinking that I loved her, when I shouldn't have even like her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child
Do what you may, but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch take me to trial
Why you with this shit? Cause I ain't read you no vows?
Bitch move on. Me and you ain't working out
So... What's it matter that I moved to work out
'Long as I provide, and put food in his mouth
'Mater fact, I'm in school right now
'case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My momma say this shit sure to work out
All the bullshit I'm going through to see my first child
See his first steps. See his first Smile. Hear his first Words. Teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out, seeing as, the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him, he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice, so he just looks around
I know she enjoys it, so I suck it up and smile

I been hoping that you’d drop in (so very nice)
I’ll hold your hands, they’re just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what’s your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I’d better scurry (hey don't you worry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

You see, the neighbors might think
Baby, it’s bad out there
Say, what’s in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight (to break the spell)
I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least i’m gonna say that I tried
What’s the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can’t stay
Baby don’t hold out
Baby it’s cold outside

I simply must go
Babay it’s cold outside
The answer is no
I said it's cold out there
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in (so very nice)
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt’s mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious
Oh maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I’ve got to go home (but baby, you’ll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
It’s up to your knees out there
You’ve really been grand
I’m thrilled when you touch my hand (but don’t you see)
Darling how can you do this thing to me?

There’s bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can’t stay get over that old lie

We got rules we hear shots then we 'sperse out,

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)
To know that you're gone 
Hold on to the memories
Not a day goes by I
Hear a voice saying dry those eyes
'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die, no
Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die
Real niggas never die

Since everybody real, where the fakers at?
Since everybody trill, where the flakers at?
Trynta break 'em down, where the tables at?
Dufflebag full of cash like, where Vegas at?
Crap tables, life's a gamble, but a nigga won!
Now I'm lookin' round like, what have a nigga done?
My lord my God, I'm used to hustlin' hard
Guess they find it odd how a nigga beat the odds
No Illuminati never been a fan of saints
That's what happens when you room big as central station
Same rubber band my cousin tied her braids with
We ain't cop the same car my auntie played spades with
What you know about five eatin' off a half
That's five mu'fuckas now you do the math
Oxymoron these rap niggas don't lie
This real nigga shit and real niggas don't die

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)
To know that you're gone

Hello [Repeat: x9]

[T.I.]
Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'
How you doing? 

It's been a minute since I seen ya,
I fell off for the scene, 
Cause it seem like you wanted other things than da king,
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams,
Are you getting all the things that you needed and I ain't bring,
Does it satisfy your self-esteem being seen on the screen,
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'? 
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah),
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient,
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know I miss you,
To see how that other nigga treatin' you.

[Chorus: Governor]
I remember morning, noon, and night, 
I used to hold you tight,
I know we used to fuss and fight ,
But I'm just calling to say (hello) Hello, (hello, oh baby)
See time has a funny way of keeping us close, 
Even though we never stayed, toghether,
I just wanted to say (hello) hello (hello)

[T.I.]
Hello?
Hey, it's me,
Hey, what's happening? How ya doin?
I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin',
Fly you down to Miami,
Let you walk the red carpet wit a ? at the Grammys,
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?
He pose and take ? things he buy for ya,
He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya, 
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya,
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya,
And tell you how I'm missing you, loving you, and kissing you,
And think about the good old days and wanna visit you,
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you,
You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you,
Think about the past and all the time that I spent with ya,
Rubbing on that ass from behind as I dig in you, 
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you,
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to

[Chorus]

[Governor]
Every now and then I think of you, 
And I can't lie I be wantin' you,
But I understand that I'm not your man,
And I also know that the future's not in your hands 
Every now and then I'd call you to say how you doing,
And baby I miss you,
Girl, this is just to say hello,
Hello Baby.

Yeah, what if they told you the iPhone was tapped?
They see all of your browsin' and know you be in your apps
And Twitter and Instagram is really like middle men
And internet soldiers, everybody was carrying Macs
What if they said Obama was in a raid
He actually got a good ass tan and a swag to appear black
Would you believe that? Niggas impeach that, look
How bout they tell you you dyin' if you ain’t voting?
So now you go put one in and relying off that emotion and believe that
You know you do wit' your weak ass
What if they make a list? Tellin' you what is dope
Tellin' you was it, but never let they mother jump

Opinion sold but most's stay null and void
A little gossip make little people feel more important

I can't trust another motherfucker livin' in this world and this really got me losin' my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation
And the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up?
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle and the Conjure would have you fucked up
So I'm lookin' for love in all the wrong places, pop pills, drink liquor by the cases
Get high, make a woman get low, in the strip club lookin' for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis but all they ever really want's my cash

Seems like the, only thing that's, keepin' me together is my music
If it wasn't for that I think I would lose it; if it wasn't for that I would go crazy
When nobody make good on they word and the industry'd make you feel like fuck you pay me

He lost a little brother because of a gang color
Which eventually accelerated the cancer that killed his mother
And he was married to a white woman that they called a nigga lover
And it became a full time job not to kill a nigga
I wonder does he still consider that he's still a nigga
We all got choices, and the real recognize what's real and chose
But he's basically still undercover in his civilian clothes
All the right reasons
But he may not even get that love again
'Cause salary's still not enough to be a Republican
Issues of growin' up without a dad
Had 1 too many one night and forgot his badge
A brawl ensued with a racist cop
Didn't stop and ask
He was sure that he was a nigga when he shot his ass

Here's a little story that must be told
A wild young nigga off on Calverton road
I was raised on Kings ridge where there wasn't no rules
Robbing niggas for they Starter jackets and shoes
Yeah, I've done some real things, family full of fiends
Forty ounce of Old English, and new some Newport kings
Pocket full of pieces and 74' Caprisces
Europeans in a crib in Buckhead, thank you Jesus
Boy, I'm sweet James Jones when I'm whipping up a ritz
I'm really on my wrist and a super bad bitch
And you know it's southside, you can tell by the parlor
Give it a good look cuz' there'll never be another
Hoes, a hundred spokes, what you expect?
Trust me, money can't buy you that respect
Got feel it out of love, and get it from out the mud
And it'll come round, or get out the way
I'm coming down

Trying to get up to come down
Yeah, playa worldwide 3rd coast all day
Mississippi wheel connected everywhere
Mind 4eva N a Day, forever how forever anyway
You know how it be mayne when you all the way down in the game underground
Trying to get up off that thang, them people can't stand you mayne
They can't get with it mayne
'Cause they don't realize, how, what it took 
To get to a place where 4eva Is A Mighty Long Time
And all that time, you was doing it big
It's mighty good for you
4eva is, 4eva was, and 4eva we will be

I don't want you to go
It's, it's there anything I can say to make you stay

I really can’t stay 
Baby it’s cold outside
I’ve got to go away
Darling it’s cold outside
This evening has been
I been hoping that you’d drop in (so very nice)
I’ll hold your hands, they’re just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what’s your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I’d better scurry (hey don't you worry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

You see, the neighbors might think
Baby, it’s bad out there
Say, what’s in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight (to break the spell)
I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least i’m gonna say that I tried
What’s the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can’t stay
Baby don’t hold out
Baby it’s cold outside

I simply must go
Babay it’s cold outside
The answer is no
I said it's cold out there
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in (so very nice)
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt’s mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious
Oh maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I’ve got to go home (but baby, you’ll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
It’s up to your knees out there
You’ve really been grand
I’m thrilled when you touch my hand (but don’t you see)
Darling how can you do this thing to me?

There’s bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can’t stay get over that old lie

Cee Lo Green,"April 2nd 1939, the stars is in line
Divine intervention at it's own intention
Birthed a gift
In this DC kid
He sung heavenly
Good values and all
And his father was in the ministry
God fearing man with a mother that's so beautiful
The angels would serve her
What's her name?
It's Alberta
This little boy quickly became a man
From blowing in his father's church
To making his own band
Called the Moonglows
Sensational with his vocals
That drove the ladies crazy
Panties got thrown at his shows
But he was far from happy
He wore a smile just to hide it behind them doors
Him and his father constantly colliding

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire my soul
What a glory to be hold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

Destined for greatness
Counting his blessings
Young'uns struggling with pressures
That the fact that his pops was a cross dresser
But he still loved him
You know the bond between his son and father
That only pushed him and forced him to sing harder
His main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car
Believed his sound
And took him down to Motown y'all
That's where it all happened
Success in the palm of his hand
But unfortunate the fame wasn't enough
He wanted more out of life
Took it further and found himself a wife
Pretty Anna Gordy
She made his time sit still
She was the cousin of Barry G
The founder of Hitsville
Please pay attention because the story it gets ill
Shit's real
Trials and tribulations son's facing
You gotta play the cards you're dealt
Ain't no telling what life deals
Death will cause you to have night chills
Enough to keep a nigga bothered
Especially when the negatives start coming from your father

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire my soul
What a glory to be hold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

Money, women and drugs came into play
Now wouldn't you know
There goes another happy home down the drain
That night life had him speeding through hell
Scarred by the death of Tammy Terell
Couldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill
Secluding himself
From the music and the press
He was sick and really getting depressed
Time passed so he bounced back on track
New and improved
Even got himself a new wife too
Everything is on the up and up
Got his act together spiritually he claims
You could see the glow up on this fella
Tried to make amends with his father
But the hatred is too strong
Revolver in his palm
The warning that death was close
His mother screaming out ""Honey don't do it!""
One shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids
April 1st he died on the spot
The scene was so horrific
How a father could kill his own son
Defines wicked

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire my soul
What a glory to be hold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

And nah, we don't need no labels to supply the budget
Haters should stop it, the angels guide us like God is hovered
Uh, you gotta love it
All we need to keep this shit goin's the soul of Guru
The black ice in the Rollie lookin' like a frozen Yoo-hoo
Now who knew a nigga like me was fit for rock and roll
You went against me, you lose, now sit and watch the show
Like Hulu, I used to dream about leavin' the block
Off honest MCin', man, fuck all this drama I'm seein'
Believe it or not, the scoundrels, skeezers and thots
It all goes down in the DM, even your stock
You gotta love it, bitches after me, hassle me by the dozen
If she can't have me, she ask do I got a brother
I'm pretty so niggas judge me as if I'm not as gutter
But if I feel threatened I'ma definitely make a promise of it
I don't need nothin', Preme it's time to cut it
But nowadays I be pressed for time 'cause I'm climbin' up this
Ladder, I started my company, now I'm signin' others
To remind me of when y'all ain't want me, you gotta love it

Won't stand near me wishing that lightning would strike it

But admit it, it's a very catchy chorus

And it's all for hip-hop, and we all together
I'm in Brooklyn with Talib in the book store
With Macklemore in the thrift shop
And I'm sober, yes, success the only thing causes this high
The rise and fall of the good guy, slash good fly
Man you've gotta love this shit
Man I'm just out here tryna follow my dreams, fool
I'm just out here inside of my olive-green coupe
I'm just out here with the next top model tryna swallow my gene pool
My entire gene pool
We under fire, it's time to get rid of the tension between you
And I, and unify, even if we ain't cool
Shit, it's 'bout love at this point
What's the use of thugs and drugs at this point?
It's just them killin' us and us killin' us at this point, hmm
And it was over nothin', just ran him down and slugged him
I'm goin' out on a limb, tell Danny Brown I love him
Big Sean, I'm behind you, no matter what you do
They gon' have to fuck with me if they decide to fuck with you
Prolly wouldn't have survived the business if it wasn't for Kino
Shout out to Ro and Rick, Dro and Sino
Clear Soul Forces, shout out to Nolan and Ninch
Here to get paid, not owe, but to get Os to go in the end
Shout out to Fat 5 and Marv 1, Porter, Twin
Shout out to Tricky, Dove, Oba Rowland
D Twizzy, Deezy and Dub
If anybody sees Obie Trice, make sure you let him know that when he sees me, it's love
I learned early, never go to sleep with a grudge
And how easy it is to speak things into the streets and some blood
Shout out to Roc, Tiara, I know your career's gon' see numbers right out the box
Right on, shout out to Flomps
Me and Denaun, wish there was more time to fly out and bond
But, maybe some other time
I just need to make sure that my mother's fine
I just need to make sure my baby stay rich
Not poor, stay spore, stay color blind
Love, love
And if you comin' at me with hate, you can't have my rebuttal
I'm too busy makin' sure Ashley straight
I just need to make sure I keep my nigga Chav out of trouble
I just pray that Icewear Vezzo and Peezy stay in them dopeboy rocks
DBCO and dopeboy drops in memory of Dopeboy Rock
Been payin' my dues so long feel like niggas owe me
Get Nas on the phone, how can I help out with my nigga Bodie?

Signed to cover big deals, but it's no parading
See it's a couple niggas every generation
I wasn't supposed to make it out, but decode the Matrix
And when they get to speak, it's like a coded language
Reminds niggas it ain't strength in all this stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas' at the Mobil station
Full circle, mogul motivation
My, self-educated, suit, negotiations
Got these sharks that I'm sitting at this table with afraid to bait me
No tint on my Mercedes, that's for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck, like the fuckin' 80's

I weighed the risk and the reward ain't seen the scale tippin'
Let's all get on one accord and take the world niggas
Take the money, take the power and the girls with us
Can't buy that bullshit that they sell niggas
Bring drugs heads and jail niggas
Look all these ways they derail niggas
That's why respect me to the utmost when you seen just how I feel niggas
'Cause I ain't fail niggas
I seen it coming, ""didn't I tell niggas?""

Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We livin', breathin', soon we'll be teethin'
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Donnel and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint

[Khujo]
Good does not come without pain
Meaning, before it gets better, it's goin get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dyin over turf
That don't belong to us
I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to want to wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
But Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat an dforget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on
Guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thang

[Cee-Lo]
Listen to me
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right
You'll get used to singin' if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playin' 'Go Fish', but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting
Hmm?

Ceelo,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is hope!

I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I
Wish my brother would of made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, and I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, and I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die today,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin' of the joy I bring, (shit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin' lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me(I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone, and I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And no po-po bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly, and I
Wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breathe again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King why can't we all just get along?
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church and let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.

Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing, 
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her, 
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne,
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar, 
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,

Pants sagging, Bentley whipping, 
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers, 
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me, 
Draped in paisley bandannas,
Suits with Adam Stacey,
Cigar like Dick Tracy,
Its dark I get spacey,
Alcohol and laced weed,
That was part of my 80's,
The Cartier consigieres be near me,
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,
Liz Taylor tried to joke me
Cause I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be
When he gets mean, 
Think fast before I blast hoes,
Like Grassino, 
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion,

You just gotta believe it
Oh, and the dream that saves me is
That you're happy and that your free

It'll fly through the air with the greatest of ease
As much as you want now, as much as you need
Across every mountain, and all seven seas
Oh, the eagles will carry it on God's gentle breeze
And I'll never give up, I'll never give in
And you'll know that it's me when you hear the voice singin'
Li, li li li li li li .......

Singin', singin',singin'!!
Love travels the miles upon the wings of angels
Love finds you I swear it's true, I can love you from
Here
On moonbeams, on heartstrings
Love makes it's way through anything
Love finds you, I swear it's true, I will always be near
And I'll love you from here
Li, li li li li li li .......",Love Travels,1997
Celadon Candy,"Sweet 70's innovation
Holds the golden key to my inspiration
Free 70s generation
It's in the air I breathe at this elevation

Music now, was music then
I have a chance all over again
To make it loud, make it clear
All the distance disappears

Street felony, instigation
It's inner city heat across every station
Beat melody combinations
In every word I say
Of my conversation

I use it now, I used it then
When discotheque was my best friend
I boomed it loud, I made it clear
I rearranged my atmosphere
Sweet melody
Street felony
A New Energy

When the crowd, gets in your ear 
It permeates your atmosphere
But think it loud, think it clear
Ignorance will disappear
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

Broken into pieces
My disease is
That I care.

About the world, and the people living in the world.
Show me pictures of starving children
I get angry, then change the station
Still more picture of starving children
I get angry, then I get hungry
When I worked for UNICEF
It seemed to be the way, for Jesus to get my autograph
I sing their tears away.
Choking, over treacle.

They cannot hear from over there
We made a movie, then shot the sequel
Documentaries, 'cos we care.

Cue the pictures of starving children
Change the angle, change location
Still more victims like dying children

Nominate me for an Elie
Then we posed for photographs
Everyone was brave                               
A smile, a hug, and gentle laugh
Will feed their pain away
Words on broken phonographs
Reeking with decay
Close our eyes to circumstance

Hope it goes away
I'm Broken, Broken
We're Broken, Broken

You're the hole in my umbrella
The soaking wet behind my ears
The bloodstain on my name
The same disease I've had for years

If I went to see the doctor
He would say to stay away
But why should I heed advice? (The hospital charges twice)

When it's possible to feel worse
Sid and Nancy, loved each other
I want you to be my Undercutter
We'll watch the stars, lying in the gutter
I need you to be my Undercutter

Jezebel of my novella
We're soaking wet between the sheets
These feelings never change (I'm happy to be deranged)                                           
Without you I'm incomplete

Provided we don't kill each other
I want you to be my Undercutter
Make my heart, melt like butter
I need you to be my Undercutter",Sweet/Broken/Undercutter,2010

Celal Baglan,"Ben dönerim etrafýnda
Hiç kimse farketmez
Aþk bu affetmez
Ýþýklarýn sönerse
Hep dönerim etrafýnda
Hiç kimse farketmez
Aþk bu göstermez
Rüyalarýn biterse

Ýyi dinle duyarsýn sesimi uzaklardan
Dinle en kuytu acýlardan
Kalbinde yoruldunsa yolculuklardan
Vazgeç artýk yýldýzlardan
Aya benzer yüreðim
E doðal olarak takipteyim

Ah þu kaderi çözersem eðer
Bekle geliyorum aþkým
Aya benzer yüreðim
E doðal olarak takipteyim
Ah þu kaderi yenersem eðer
Seni seviyorum aþkým",Aya Benzer,2000
