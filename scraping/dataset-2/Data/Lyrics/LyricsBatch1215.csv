Tony Hatch & His Orchestra,"Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""",Somewhere in the night (theme from television series The Naked City),1998
Tony Hatch & His Orchestra,"Joanna
I can't forget the one they call Joanna
We owned the summer, hand in hand Joanna
And now she's always just a tear away
Goodbye you, you long lost summer
Leaving me behind you
Revealing things for lovers that may find you
I still hang on to every word that day, you passed my way
Joanna
You made the man a child again, so sweetly
He breathed your smile
Lived in your eyes completely
And on his heart there's still a trace of you
I love you but nothing in this world could make you mine
Yet still in time
Joanna
Joanna, you may remember me and change your mind

I love you but nothing in this world could make you mine
Yet still in time
Joanna
Joanna, you may remember me and change your mind",Joanna,2002
Tony Hatch & His Orchestra,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love,2002
Tony Hatch & His Orchestra,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?",Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),2002
Tony Hatch & His Orchestra,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon","Up, Up and Away",2002

Tony Henry,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be, all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live, all by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Some times I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure",Da Solo No - All by Myself,2005
Tony Henry,"The higher you build your barriers
The taller I become
The further you take my rights away
The faster I will run
You can deny me, you can decide
To turn your face away
No matter 'cause there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no
There's something inside so strong
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, something inside so strong

The more you refuse to hear my voice (ooh-weh ooh-weh ooh-wehooh-weh)
The louder I will sing
You hide behind walls of Jericho (ooh-weh ooh-weh ooh-wehooh-weh)
Your lies will come tumbling
Deny my place in time, you squander wealth that's mine
My light will shine so brightly it will blind you
Because there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no
There's something inside so strong
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, something inside so strong

Brothers and sisters, when they insist we're just not good enough
Well we know better, just look him in his eyes and say
We're gonna do it anyway, we're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway, we're gonna do it anyway
Because there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no, oh no
There's something inside so strong

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no, oh no
There's something inside so strong

Tony Hightower,"Last night I thought of you on the subway
I thought of you as the rain soaked my feet
I thought of you as I walked alone
Down the unmowed road
I thought things I don't think I should repeat
Last night was quiet in my neighborhood
You could hear people in their houses watching TV
Their living rooms glowed blue
And it made me think of you
I thought about why you weren't here with me
 But had I asked if you would come home with me
 Would you have said yes, or would you have said no?
 Better you be there than I scare you away
 That was the decision I made
Last night, standing outside your mother's house
Your cold breath glowed in the streetlight
My hands and thoughts roamed
As to, should I take you home?
An opportunity might have been blown
Last night I remember forcing my door open with my shoulder
With strength I never even knew I had
And I thought:
Would I be as strong if you had come along?
And would I have wanted inside so bad?
 But had I asked if you would come home with me
 Would you have said yes, or would you have said no?
 Better you be there than I scare you away
 That was the decision I made, last night
I've been told nothing in this world is certain
But that and a bottle of scotch
And my mind is still burdened
Last night, when I held you at your door
I felt like I had the strength of ten x ten x ten x ten
And there was this light outside
And considering the time of night
I might have asked that extra question, given that moment again
Last night was quiet in my neighborhood
You could hear people in their houses watching TV
Their living rooms glowed blue, and it made me think of you",Last Night,1997
Tony Hollins,"You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
I don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself

You know you caught me crawlin', baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
Don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself

You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window, baby
Wanna crawl up to your door; you got anything I want, baby?
Wanna crawl up on your floor
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den

You know you caught me crawlin', baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den",Crawling King Snake,1997
Tony Hughes,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1995
Tony Hymas,"Must have been livin' right the day I met you
Had to be a starry night, my dreams came true
I don't deserve him, I don't understand
I'm gonna love you the best that I can

Yes I'd die for this dance
To hold you, to talk of romance
I've never been lucky, but I've got to take the chance
I'm caught up in some kind of trance
And yes I would die for this dance

Where did you come from, I know where it seems
Maybe an angel smiling on me
I know it's crazy, you've taken my heart
I'll never leave you, you're my missing part

Yes I'd die for this dance
To hold you, to talk of romance
I've never been lucky, I've got to take the chance
I'm caught up in some kind of trance
And yes I would die for this dance

I feel like I'm losing control
It's got to my heart and my soul
I'm seeing my future unfold
I can't let go of you, I need you

Oh I'd die for this dance
To hold you and talk of romance
I've never been lucky, I've got to take the chance
And yes I would die for this
Die for this dance
To hold you and talk of romance
I've never been lucky, I've got to take the chance

Tony Iommi,"I am one, one that shines
Yeah, I was born of a scorpion´s mind
I am one, so alive
Don´t try to teach me what your lips can´t decide

Apocalyptic thoughts of doom
They tell us not to fear

Watch your mother die, and then tell us not to fight
Don't you realize, they're just a bunch of fools
Speak the truth and lie, and expect us to believe
Tell me who is fooling who

Watch the soldiers marching
They don't march for you or me
They're just there to kill the enemy

Watch your mother die, and then tell us not to fight
Don't you realize, they're just a bunch of fools
Speak the truth and lie, and expect us to believe
Tell me who is fooling who

Will they ever wake up
Will they ever see the light

Tony Iommi,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare

The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul",Trashed,2006
Tony Iommi,"Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights

Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no

The wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old

Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone

They warned me of my fate, but I was quite prepared to meet it

And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

I knocked on the pearly gates
Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through
I smiled, threw my hands in the air
Laughed and got arrested
They said hey man, you're in the wrong place
Your behaviour is a disgrace

No party?

Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me

To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame

Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

The bells of Notre Dame

On the steps of Notre Dame

Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame

(Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control

Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see

Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

 jean jumper up around you.

You can feel it in your bones
You know a change is gonna come;
Oh, and a change never done nobody no harm.

out around the campfires;
Boiling 'em some coffee in an old tin can, with their jumpers pulled
up around their heads;
Trying to stay warm; Oooh! Listen to 'em, oh yea!
But it's also a time when I get a restless feeling inside my bones;
Makes me just want to get on a freight train and ride somewhere;
Like there's something, somewhere saying, ""Come see about me.""
Check it out!

You can feel it in your bones
You know a change is gonna come;
Oh, and a change never done nobody no harm.

the turning of the leaves;
Kinda smells good to you, yea! But it don't last long;

yourself warm;

Tony Joe White,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

Tony Joe White,"Across the river an owl was callin'
As he slowly made his rounds
A midnight dew was softly falling
On the ground, on the ground

She was standing by the campfire
I watched her move into the dance
And when she looked at me with those sexy eyes
They seemed to say, ""Hey boy, d'ya wanna take a chance?""

Bayou woman you make me feel it
Dancing barefoot in the night
Moving softly in the shadows
In the pale moonlight

Behind the clouds, the moon was slipping
I felt her move into my arms
She said, ""Are you into skinnin'?""
I said, ""Anything baby, to keep warm""

Bayou woman you make me feel it
Runnin' barefoot in the night
Standing golden by the river

Tony Joe White,"I've kept it inside much too long
There's no relief
Carry it around just like a stone
Too heavy for me

I have paid the price of standing 
On the outside looking in 

It's time to let the healing begin

A boy is strung out he's going through hell
His mother weeps
His spirit is broken and there's nothing left
Just a terrible need

And the days are marked by the heaviness of the heart
It never mends
Until the healing begins

And the tension prowels the streets like an animal
The people stay behind their locks and chains
It's a shame
When so many are trying their best to live as one
And the smoke from the fires covers up the sun

A young girl is lying in the dirt
Her dreams ended there
Caught in the crossfire on somebody's turf
Hatred in the air

It's a voice that never sings
A winter without the spring
It never ends
Time to let the healing begin

And anything the big-guy says (to him) the little guy is for; ?cause he digs, and he? ( ), ?cool.?
So it?s called, ?Roosevelt & Ira Lee?

The river was dark and muddy,
And the moon was on the rise.
And all of the creatures in the swamp-land
Had woke up to feed for the night.

Roosevelt and Ira Lee (huh!) were sittin? there on a log,
And Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt and said, 
?I?d sure like to have-a me some BULLFROG(s).?

He said, ?Yeah. YEAH! Lord.(!) Sure would taste good!?

So they slipped on their rubber boots,
And walked down to the water?s edge.
And right away they knew the night would be a bummer,
?cause Ira Lee stepped on a Water Mocc-sin head.

He said, ?uuhOh, -uuOH! LORD! Somebody help me!? (heh-heh-heh.)
(HARMONICA)

Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt
(when he quit his screaming and kickin?)
And he said, ?Let?s forget about the Bullfrog Legs, and go out and steal some chickens.?

Ol? Roosevelt said, like this now, ?Yeah. Yeah! OO-oo-oui! Sure would taste good!... ?Yes it would. (I love my chicken.)?

We were barefoot stompin'
She just kept igniting my fuse

I was blinded by the blackness
Of her long silk stockings
She was rocking with an optical illusion
This ain't how I'd thought it'd be
She just kept on keeping me
In a total state of confusion

She took me for a ride
Rattled me down to my shoes
And I found out
She was an undercover agent for the blues

She never really needed love
Omnidirectional
I was just an innocent bystander
She kept on getting kinkier
I sank hook, line, and sinker
Just, just, just too hot to handle

She took me by storm
It must of been a season for the fools
She's so bad
An undercover agent for the blues

Tony Kadleck,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013
Tony Kadleck,"It's all there in the gospels
The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects 
But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty 
The stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still

""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I cannot be missing, the lads'll expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

It's the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears

Where the porters, surprised by her lack of Royal baggage,
Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage,
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.
There's a fight over seats, ""I beg pardon Your Grace,
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Aye, but where are they going?"" All the porters debate,
""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide,
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide.""
There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome,
Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home.
There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales,
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails.
""Why, they haven't got tickets,"" ""Come now, it's just a detail,
There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail,
For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail!""

I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

Ever since I was a tiny boy
I don't want no candy
I don't need toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing 'til I got
Blisters on my hand
Because

When I get older they think I'm a fool
The teacher told me I should stay after school
She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks were so hot
I made the teacher want to dance
And that's why

Listen to this
Every day when I get home from work
I feel so frustrated
the boss is a jerk
And I get my sticks and go out to the shed
And i pound on that drum like it was the boss's head
Because

I can bang on that drum
Hey you want to a bang at it?
I can do this all day",Bang the Drum All Day,2002

Come around and talk it over
So many things that I want to say

You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to

Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you

Stay the night but keep it under cover
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shaking

But something in my mind's not making sense
It's been a while since we were all alone

But I can't hide the way I'm feeling

As you're leaving please would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong

Another shoulder to cry upon
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

Tony Light,"Dark comedy cold as the ocean
Ad a l0l cause nobody seems to know when I'm joking
For those who haven't heard of me
I'm bad at sarcasm so I work in absurdity
On that laugh to keep from crying tip
Rap like Wyatt vs Chet in Weird Science
Cause my genre's all hack
Actions cliche, melodrama falls flat
And everybody's getting fired
I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired
Rap songs like Patch Adams
Shadyac thought of it as art 'til they laughed at it
Rap songs like Steven Wright
Monotone drone, people wonder if he breathing right

We got that dark dark comedy
That dark d-dark dark dark d-dark comedy

Cause rappers ruin the punchline
Like stand up club hecklers doing the punchline
Cause I'll tweet on Sunday morning like a preacher at a church
Because my true religion is the thirst
It's like Burn After Reading
The dark ugly truth that addicts learn at the meetings
Sean already wrote about the modern man
The only other option is the plight of the hologram
It's dark comedy, I would've called it black
If another dude calls me a racist, I'mma snap
Cause Google knows what's in my cabinet
And Facebook logs all of my favorite sandwiches
And what they need the damn data for
To analyze the shit they'd need a whole 'nother labor force
Cause I'm addicted to my celly
And I gotta have some coffee in my belly, ya smell me

There's mad shootings on the news
Unless it's in the Chi, cause blacks and mexicans can die
I swear we live in John Lennon songs
Matching track suit like dude in Royal Tenenbaums
It's like the In Living Color cast
We'd laughing trying not to wish death on the upper class
I'd like to run up on the Koch Brothers
And beat 'em with a garden hose made of old rubber
Give 'em rock bottoms and a cold stone stunner
Drop some cold butter on 'em from the skyscraper
Pistol whip 'em with the handle of a lightsaber
Cut 'em with rice paper, chuckle like a wiseacre
Instead think of something sarcastic, black

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

How'd I end up here?
So uncomfortable
I'm a stranger in this body
The world's an ugly place
And that's a fact that fate has brought me
I had to disappear
So it would all just go away
Now the end is drawing near
And God I wish you would've stayed

It cuts deep 'cause our hearts are still attached
A deadly touch spreads an itch that can't be scratched
Sometimes I wish it would all just fade to black

That I almost held the world in my hands

In the town that has disowned me

Hedge my bets 'cause it can't hurt to pretend

How could people applaud it
It's madness it's all so insane!

Blood, through your heart
Never stops for one minute
And there you will find:
- There is no other way!

The arena's still crowded
But the rules take new forms
Some of them tread on stages,
Some others chase after a ball...

Loved her pretty face
I said: ""Hey, you're alright, so alright!""
I was sitting in her car
She told me: ""You're a star and I know you.""

Next day she took me out
To a rough kick boxing show
Violence really turned her on, oh no
She was screaming for more blood
Loved it more than any drug I couldn't stand it

Tony Martin,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days,
Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgement morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away.",Hallelujah!,

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love song's never out of date
Heart's full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It’s still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafÃ¢??

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

Tony Martin,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You),2001
Tony Martin,"My ba-by kissed me good-night, and I am glad to relate 
That by the time I got home, I was feeling great
I climbed up the door and o-pened the stairs.
I said my pajamas and put on my pray'rs.
I turned off the bed and crawled into the light.
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

Next morning, I woke and scrambled my shoes.
I shined up an egg, then I toasted the news,
I buttered my tie and took another bite.
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

By evening I felt normal, so we went out again.
You said, ""Goodnight,"" and kissed me.
I hurried home and then,

I climbed up the door and opened the stairs.
I said my pajamas and put on my prayr's.
I turned off the bed and crawled into the light,
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

I powdered my hair and pinned up my nose.
I hung up the bath and I turned on my clothes.
I put out the clock and wound the cat up tight,
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

I ran up the shade and pulled down the stair.
I curled up the rug and I vacuumed my hair.
I just couldn't tell my left foot from my right,
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

By evening I felt normal, so we went out again.
You said, ""Goodnight,"" and kissed me.
I hurried home and then,

I lifted the preach'r and called up the phone.

Things I was thinking of.

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,

To you my love, my life, my all

I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

I used to think your love was something that I
Could take or leave alone.
But now I couldn't do without my supply,
I need you for my own.

I must have you ev'ry day,
As regularly as coffee or tea.
You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free,
You're getting to be a habit with me,

You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

I watch till a star breaks through

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze, caresses me

If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

For every one of them.

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen,
Zoot suit and shiny shoes.
He ran around town and threw his mentholated laughter.
Most of his memories drowned.

But he remembers what his mother used to shout.
She used to shout,
""One day, surely son,
The streets are gonna tire you out.""

Tommy had a wife and family,
But the needle came between the love and the hard times.
Thank God for Sally,
She was there through the misery.

Just a place to lay his head.
Just about better off than dead.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day

Vince, came up from the country.
Couldn't even find himself a room.
Thinking about his babies.
They're further away than the moon.

With no money but his pride in his pocket.
There's really no way he can go home.
There's a picture of his woman in his locket.
Most of all he doesn't want to be alone.

You know, I wanna fuck you bitch
But I know, I'm not givin' you one red cent
My dough, ain't helpin' you with your rent
I never been a trick, you oughta pay for the dick

Slidin' on a slab and all she wanna do was rape me
But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower
Late night gobbler
Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'

And to inspire, she opened wide, and swimmin' in my denim (You, you, you, you, you bitch)

Got me a drug dealer ride, put liq' with coke up in her eye
Tryin' to charge me for that trash ass, pussy, she out of mind
Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)

Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that
Choose me, she know the scope, it's pimpin', no love for a hoe

Tony Moran,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play.

He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child,

I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile.

I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye",Lately,2003

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it 
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart 

 Something's gone, I can't explain 
The heat is missing from the plain 
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain 
There's something wrong with you and me 
When more than one adds up to three 
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see 
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
when you do what you do without love, without love 

 I'm gonna paint a picture of you 
The only colour I need is blue 
You're out of love, baby you know it's true 
Tell me why and I'll try to understand 

 Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
When you do what you do without love 

 It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
Then you know it's a crime that you kill me up 
When you do what you do without love, without love 
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing without love",Do What You Do,1991

Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 We're living in a world of stars and dust 
Between heaven and all that surrounds us 
We're travellers here, spirits passing through 
And the love we give, is all that will endure 
Hey now, what we had is gone 
But I still remember you 
Just like a rose after the rain 
Something beautiful remains 

 Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 Now the darkness falls, the sun's going down 
One by one, the stars are coming out 
Tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand 
As one day ends, a new day must begin 
Hey now, though we are apart 
You're here forever in my dreams 
Hey now, love is lost and gained 
(What you gonna do about it, what you gonna say) 
Something beautiful remains 

 Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 And you wonder sometimes how we carry on 
When you've lost the love you knew 
But it's alright, it's alright 
To your own heart be true",Something Beautiful Remains,1991

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Is a day of sorrow

Get too far behind them

Against my lips

And it looks like you lose again, my friend

He don't chase rainbows

You can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just look up your rainy day man

Store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain

Go on and pray for rain

In such an early song

Oh no, don't say it's true

""I'm happy, hope you're happy too 
I've loved all I've needed to love 
Sordid details following""

But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing

We know Major Tom's a junkie 
Strung out in heaven's high 
Hitting an all-time low 

Time and again I tell myself 
I'll stay clean tonight 
But the little green wheels are following me 
Oh no, not again 
I'm stuck with a valuable friend 
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too"" 
One flash of light but no smoking pistol 

I never done good things I never done bad things 
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh 
Want an axe to break the ice 
Wanna come down right now 

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love-maker
That I ever had

Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
While the Wabash moon is shining bright?

Had I been true to her, I'd be there now
In the strawberry patch with Sally tonight, oh yeah
In the strawberry patch with my Sally tonight
I just can't take it, no more, no

Tony Orlando & Dawn,"Now the year has come to a close
And I've had my last dance with you
Unto the empty streets we go
And this might be my last chance with you

So I might as well get it over
'Cause the things I've got to say won't wait until another day

You're a lady
I'm a man
You're supposed to understand
How these things are often planned to be

You're romantic
I'm a fool
You're the teacher
I've come to school
Here I sit
And hope that you'll love me

You're all magic
Unlock my chain
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
So I say with no restrain
Be mine, oh be mine

Hard to answer, yes, I agree
But then I've got to know
I'm not asking you to marry me
Just a little love to show

Oh I know I could make you happy
So the things I have to say
won't wait until another day

You're a lady
I'm a man
You're supposed to understand
How these things are often planned to be

You're romantic
I'm a fool
You're the teacher
I've come to school
Here I sit
And hope that you'll love me

You're all magic
Unlock my chain
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
So I say with no restrain
Be mine, oh be mine",You're a Lady,1998
Tony Orlando & Dawn,"Candida
Dawn 

The stars won't come out if they know that you're about
Cause they couldn't match the glow of your eyes
And, oh, who am I ? Just an ordinary guy
Tryin hard to win me first prize

[Chorus]
Oh my Candida
We could make it together
The further from here girl the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Oh my Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise that life will be sweeter
'Cause it said so in my dreams

The future looks bright, the gypsy told me so last night
Said she saw our children playing in the sunshine
And there were you and I in a house, baby, no lie
And all these things were yours, and they were mine

[Chorus x2]",Candida,1999
Tony Orlando & Dawn,"In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
 
Karin, she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine 
And watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now
I'm cryin', ain't I?
Gone to Carolina in my mind
 
There ain't no doubt in no ones mind 
That love's the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey babe, the sky's on fire
I'm dying, ain't I?
Gone to Carolina in my mind
 
In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
And, ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
 
Dark and silent, late last night,
I think I might have heard the highway call 
And geese in flight and dogs that bite
The signs that might be omens say 
I'm goin', I'm goin'
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
 
With a holy host of others standin' around me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it seems like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me, if I'm up and gone to
Carolina in my mind
 
In my mind I'm goin' to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
Ain't is just like a friend of mine 
To hit me from behind
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
Gone to Carolina in my mind
And I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind
Goin' to Carolina in my mind
Gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Say nice things about me 'cause I'm gone south now
Got to carry on without me, I'm gone",Carolina in My Mind,1999
